He created a new industry, conservative commentary. \n\nFor decades he deconstructed the hypocrisy and duplicity of the political left and the corporate media with simple facts and logic, encouraging millions to critically assess what they hear in the news. \n\nHe was also one of the earliest and biggest fans of Trump. Day after day he made his case to the American people why Trump, despite being untested in the political realm, was the best candidate. \n\nWe don't know how much of the black vote that Trump got was because of Rush Limbaugh. Near the end of his career in particular began reaching out to the African-American community. He went on The breakfast club with charlamagne the god and made his case directly to the African American community that the Democrats were simply using them as pawns and not really interested in helping them.\n\nRush was unstoppable. Through his entire career the left tried to silence him with all methods honorable and underhanded, but his audience just grew and grew right up to the end. He was a raging Bull that didn't stop until a force of nature that modern medicine still can't defeat took him down. So he gets the hero salute. He would have been thrilled to see this day. \n\nThis weekend during your reveries pour one out for Rush.",

Arrested for birth control, ivf banned, national abortion ban, etc. All of it is utter bullshit. That is in top of the \"Hello fellow Republicans,\" ads that show various people claiming to have voted Trump in the past 2 elections but won't in the next, each one playing the same \"rich as hell\" sound bite. Its so ridiculously obvious they are actors since the script is damn near identical regardless of who the \"Republican\" is.",
