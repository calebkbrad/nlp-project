When I saw her tanking early in Florida by big numbers and Dade county turning 18 points vs. the last election, and even Palm Beach co. was a near draw vs. a big loss last time, I knew she would be in trouble nationally.  Even in the blue states, she didn't do well - I think Illinois was a 17-point Biden win in 2020 vs. 8 or 9 this time, and NJ went from a 16 point win to 4 or 5.  And don't even mention the BS Des Moines Register poll vs. his 13 point actual win in Iowa, LOL.\n\nThe biggest problem for democrats is that, aside from people being tired of the identity politics, poor immigration controls and enabling of criminality, she just wasn't a likeable or good candidate.",

      "text": "The momentum built during this election was incredible. People don\u2019t like the direction the country was going, and they showed it by giving the Republicans the presidency, the senate, and likely the house too. Plus, there\u2019s a good chance Thomas and/or Alito retire soon and give Trump another two SCOTUS picks (for a total of 5 Justices appointed by Trump).\n\nBut the Republicans need to not get complacent. Trump isn\u2019t going to be the nominee in 2028. Whoever the Republican nominee is, they need to keep that same energy that Trump demonstrated in this election.\n\nWe haven\u2019t had a Republican take office after a different Republican president since George H.W. Bush won the 1988 election after Reagan. We can\u2019t let them do what they did these last four years again. We can\u2019t let them undo all of the good things Trump is very likely to accomplish between now and January 2029. \n\nI really hope Trump gets us back on track after these disastrous last four years.

As a 60 year old dem turned independent who voted for Trump in this and the last election, really pleased with the results and the increased level of diversity within the republican camp, which belies the dem nonsense belief, which assumed that everyone would be aligned with their garbage identity and victim-based politics forever.

Day after day he made his case to the American people why Trump, despite being untested in the political realm, was the best candidate. \n\nWe don't know how much of the black vote that Trump got was because of Rush Limbaugh. Near the end of his career in particular began reaching out to the African-American community. He went on The breakfast club with charlamagne the god and made his case directly to the African American community that the Democrats were simply using them as pawns and not really interested in helping them.\n\nRush was unstoppable. Through his entire career the left tried to silence him with all methods honorable and underhanded, but his audience just grew and grew right up to the end.

Polls have and will most likely be just a sociological construct of its own making.
