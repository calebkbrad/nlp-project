That is in top of the \"Hello fellow Republicans,\" ads that show various people claiming to have voted Trump in the past 2 elections but won't in the next, each one playing the same \"rich as hell\" sound bite. Its so ridiculously obvious they are actors since the script is damn near identical regardless of who the \"Republican\" is.",

I personally agree with the sentiment that the federal government does not have a responsibility to weigh in and control everything and that local communities and states should decide how to deal with such matter. The problems of mental health go far beyond repealing federal spending on it so don't want to go down that rabbit hole.\n\nFor your second point on the repeal of the fairness doctrine, I also personally take the side that in the balance of FCC vs first admendment, I go first admendment. The issues aren't that news corporations are biased, it's that they act like they are balanced. My issue with the FCC regulating it is if they are biased...which they would be by the measure of all government agencies having bias, they would not impose the rules of the fairness doctrine equally. \n\nThanks for specifying what you mean though, these are all interesting topics to discuss.",

Of course, these people are \u201canonymous\u201d and nobody outside of these two sources can verify anything being said. \n\nAgain, it is just some insane story with unverified sources and accusations that the left, as per usual, takes as gospel truth because they hate anyone who disagrees with them.",

The story has unverified sources and just states that 2 people \u201cheard him say it\u201d. Great standard of evidence from this titan of journalism /s. \n\nEssentially, as per usual, the left is running with it as ironclad proof that Trump is Hitler. It\u2019s disgusting how they can constantly do this and still get away with it. It\u2019s like clockwork.",
         "There isn\u2019t a video.

         "It was something allegedly to the effect of that if he gets elected you\u2019ll never have to vote again. Like he was going to do away with the way we vote. \n\nTo be clear- I\u2019m sure this is taken highly out of context",
         "So, the very definition of unverifiable hearsay. If Trump was a private citizen, sounds like it would qualify as slander.",
         "lol so its \"hearsay?\" We learned that word from the amber turd trial. \n\nIts just bullshit then",
         "Wait that Jeremy Goldberg clown? The same one that made up the \u201csuckers and losers\u201d hoax?",
         "Oh it was. It was normal Trump hyperbole. It was in the context of how he\u2019s gonna have this country fixed so good you won\u2019t have to worry about voting anymore. He was speaking to an evangelical base that typically shy away from voting while encouraging them to vote just this once",
         "He was speaking to people that normally don't vote, asking them to vote this time as its so important. After he wins, he'll work on correcting the integrity of our elections as right now there's enough stuff to make anyone concerned about that. Then it won't be so important that those usual non-voters vote. They can go back to ignoring it as there won't be anything shady to give any doubt. Right now we need a win too big for them to cheat against.",
         "Not only that, but multiple former White House staff have publicly come out and said that he *did not* ever say that.\n\nSo it comes down to who you believe: former staff who are loyal to Trump or former staff who think Trump\u2019s a nazi. Somebody\u2019s lying.\n\nEither the anti-Trump crowd is lying, presumably to influence the election. Or the pro-Trump crowd is lying to shield him because he actually is a Nazi sympathizer. I\u2019ll let you decide which seems more likely. \n\nBut the other issue is the people making the claim, the former staff who hate Trump, have no evidence besides \u201cI heard him say it!\u201d and expect the other side to provide proof he never said it. Which is, of course, completely insane. The burden of proof is very much on the \u201cTrump is a Nazi\u201d side of the argument.",
         "Yep. They really have got nothing. \n\nAlso, I can almost guarantee you that this was released last week knowing that Trump would be having his rally at MSG where they could try to make a stronger link to the other stupidity they are running with about the Nazi rally at MSG. The timing is more than questionable when they have been trying to make this connection for a while and the same week Trump is set to have a rally there is the same week that this article drops.",
         "Yeah same guy. The pattern is the same as well. The story is all just \u201cthese people who we can\u2019t name said that Trump said X\u201d.",
         "That makes so much more sense.",

Most people who say they hate him can't rationally, coherently and logically even present an argument as to why they hate the man as much as they do, without regurgitating a tirade of debunked memes and falsehoods (like the project 2025 nonsense).\n\nIt's ironic for people who like to think they're smarter than everyone else, they certainly seem to demand allegiance to groupthink and hive mind, which to me is the opposite of how a really intelligent, insightful individual behaves.

Pretty sure the only reason it varies at all is us normies are sick of it and downvoting to screw with their numbers. Also, the algorithm is putting anti Trump or vote for Kamala posts from swing states (especially Georgia and Pennsylvania) in my feed daily. I have never commented or shown any interest in those states so I\u2019m assuming they are trying to make us feel there is a huge groundswell of support in those States.

      "comments": [
         "She played someone's video very similar to this a number of months ago, going through the \"live stream\" setup even though her show is recorded, and things like that.  I think she is as authentic as any 20-something can be when they have millions of people watching them.  A lot of what they do (literally every actor, interviewer, content creator, etc.) is done with \"high quality video\" in mind, so it necessarily has to have some scripting.  At least in terms of loose scripting.  \n\nBut is her show a genuine show with genuine viewpoints from someone who believes what they say?  There's zero reason or evidence to think otherwise.  I think she is very authentic.",
         "Why do we on the right wonder if our people are authentic?  The left doesn't do this. \n\nTaylor Swift by all accounts was right leaning, she flips to left to help her career, and not a single person on the left wonders if she's being authentic. Because they didn't care, because she is carrying their water.\n\nWe need to stop caring!!!  Brett Cooper is young, intelligent, well spoken and attractive. Not to mention female. The right needs more of this!!!  Something like 70% of females her age are Democrat, so we should be supporting the hell out of her, and anyone like her.\n\nStop worrying if people are authentic.  If they aren't it will come out eventually, and we can stop supporting them then.  I'm looking at you Matt Drudge.",
         "I'm a woman in my later forties, and so the stuff she covers--popular culture, social media, etc--doesn't tend to interest me a lot, but I've slowly become more interested in listening to her. Watch her interview with Jordan Peterson--she is actually an extremely accomplished and impressive young woman, and seems to have a very level head on her shoulders. She started college even younger than Ben did, and was emancipated and supporting herself by 15, as an example. I have yet to see her act, so I will reserve my opinion on that. \n\nEvery Daily Wire regular I have ever heard has said that they are allowed to say whatever they want to on their show. Candace obviously turned into the exception, but even then, it wasn't a case of them standing over her shoulder and telling her what to say. She was allowed to say what she wanted to--but when that no longer represented opinions they wanted associated with the Daily Wire, they let her go. Which is all to say that there is no reason to think Brett doesn't have similar freedom to express her genuine opinions. I'm sure she works with her team to choose the videos or stories she wants to respond to, and makes a plan about what to say, but that doesn't make it less genuine.",
         "I haven\u2019t watched her show, but I\u2019m a guy in my late thirties. My wife likes her show.",

         "I like the videos of hers that I watch, but I\u2019m not a regular viewer. I honestly don\u2019t get the argument about being \u201cauthentic.\u201c just because she has an outline for her videos doesn\u2019t make her any more or less authentic than someone who just shoots from the hip. It means she\u2019s more organized. Also, the headphones and microphone thing are not a creation of streamers. That\u2019s what radio hosts have done forever. we just didn\u2019t have video cameras on them doing it until more recent years. All I know is, she\u2019s got those segues into the sponsor ad down.",
         "What a weak attempt to discredit BC. Her videos are interesting, and she is popular because she is great at what she does. I wonder if there would ever be a context where those arguing with her credibility would accept that anybody could express conservative views, ever. I get the impression they dont like that she has influence and may cause other people to share her beliefs, and rather than just argue on the merits, they try to make her out as inauthentic (for having a relatable streaming setup, set?). I have a feeling this video will change exactly 0 minds for those who watch and enjoy her content.",
         "She's too young for me. I'm out of her target demographic.\n\nAs for being \"a propaganda machine\" that sounds like any critique from the other end of the political spectrum.

         "I like her. She\u2019s authentic, funny, thoughtful. \n\nI don\u2019t watch many of her videos because she focuses on youth culture, which is usually a bunch of stuff I don\u2019t care about because I\u2019m too old (mid 30s).

         "I follow her but I kind of prefer Amala Ekpunobi for the young conservative woman perspective. In some sense they are both manufactured in that they have been elevated by rich older conservative men and broadcast from high end studios made to look like some idealized young woman's living space.

Both come from liberal backgrounds but came to see the lunacy of the modern left, I am not cynical enough to believe that that awakening was manufactured for profit,",

         "I never imagined people would be so excited for a senile old man to win an election, but Democrats are weird so.",
         "Why are some comments locked but not others for up/down votes? Mods being opinionated?\n\nLock the thread or don\u2019t.",
         "He's not American, let him stay out of our elections.\nThough, on the other hand, Chuck Schumer did give a speech implying that the PM of his country should be ousted.",
         "Like I'm so conflicted, I know for a Fact that Trump/Vance is the right way to go, it's the only way to go, these are good people who Love Ameirca and it's citizens. And I hear People Like Andrew Wilson, Ben Shapiro, and Matt Walsh give Amazing, sound arguments that no one can Refute as to why Trump is good. Especially Andrew Wilson. But when Everyone On social media is 98% Democrat it's Like they constantly Gaslight me into Doubting myself, And it's so hard to Think about sometimes",
         "He lives in America",
         "If it\u2019s hard to think about that means you are thinking hard. But just because a lot of people think something doesn\u2019t mean they are right. You have to think and decide for yourself. But also, it\u2019s usually not a question of Trump being better or worse than Kamala, it\u2019s a question of alignment of values. So Kamala is the right choice for people with some values and the wrong choice for people with other values. For me, Kamala is actively against many of my values, while Trump\u2019s policies are consistent with most of my values.",
         "Just keep thinking for yourself. You can\u2019t talk to people if they don\u2019t want to listen. If they\u2019re gaslighting, it\u2019s probably an indication that they have no good points to make.",
         "\u201cDo not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God\u2019s will is\u2014his good, pleasing and perfect will.\u201d Romans 12:2",
         "It is not the content that goes into a man that makes a man, but the content that comes out.",
         "No, he lives in the UAE.",
         "Well Kamala has no values \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80. She says what she thinks people wanna hear literally depending on the state. Meanwhile Trump is completely transparent and everyone literally knows basically everything about him. And Frankly Basically everything Kamala stands For goes against My Morals (Christian Ethics which is what we all should live by). I guess I'm js whining Everyone doesn't see the truth \ud83e\udd37"
