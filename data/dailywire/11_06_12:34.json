Whoever the Republican nominee is, they need to keep that same energy that Trump demonstrated in this election.\n\nWe haven\u2019t had a Republican take office after a different Republican president since George H.W. Bush won the 1988 election after Reagan. We can\u2019t let them do what they did these last four years again.

Ironically though, yes there were a lot of voters who thought someone was a threat to democracy but overwhelmingly those people voted for Trump, because they actually thought Harris was a threat to democracy not Trump. Idk how there was so many people who voted for Harris. I will say though that I won\u2019t be able to rest easy until every vote is counted.",

They literally ignored the votes of their own people. That is the textbook definition of anti democratic.",

In fact I\u2019d rather not know so I can enjoy their craft in peace. I\u2019d also prefer for them to stop broadcasting their opinions as if we should take them into account. The exception being for criminal/ extremely immoral activity.\n\nSame for politicians. Over the years I\u2019ve come to have the impression that Trump really is not a bad person in real life. I think he seems savvy and funny. But you know what, I don\u2019t really care. What matters is I believe he is sincere in trying to make the country better, and I mostly agree with most of his policies.",

Maybe I\u2019m wrong about Trump and he\u2019s trying to undermine the country, but so far, I believe him, which is why I support him. His track record also supports that, which as you pointed out, it\u2019s what actually matters. In contrast, I don\u2019t believe in almost anything that comes out of Harris\u2019 mouth."

The issues aren't that news corporations are biased, it's that they act like they are balanced. My issue with the FCC regulating it is if they are biased...which they would be by the measure of all government agencies having bias, they would not impose the rules of the fairness doctrine equally. \n\nThanks for specifying what you mean though, these are all interesting topics to discuss.",
