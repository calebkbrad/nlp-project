Those states were not crushing defeats, they were relatively close. Either republicans in those states were motivated to actually go vote, or some dems crossed over. Either way, Trump killed it with his campaign, so many iconic moments.",

Biden won New Jersey by 16 and Hillary won it by 13.  Obama won it by 16 and 18.  Trump barely lost it.  That's pretty shocking.\n\nHillary won California by 30 points.  Kamala only won it by 17.\n\nThat's the big difference in the popular vote in this election - democrats usually run up the score in the deep blue states leading to a big popular vote advantage.  But either a lot of democrats stayed home or they crossed over and voted for Trump.",

Pence could not have won in 2024. Ignore the events of J6 as they don't happen in this theoretical timeline. Liberals hate Pence for being conservative, and Republicans likely still would have soured on him just due to having been the head of Trump's Covid task force. Covid policy was largely a state-level issue, but most voters don't think that deeply and Pence was the face of the Trump administration's covid response and it would have hurt him even more electorally than is boringness already does.\n\nLosing in 2020 ultimately led to the events that brought people like Tulsi and RFK Jr to our side. It let Trump ditch Pence for a charismatic and electable VP. It shined A LOT of light on how far left the Democratic Party has moved. It created a path for the MAGA movement to outlive Trump's presidency.\n\nEither the Democrats will abandon some of their more insane positions and moderate themselves towards the center or they will never win a federal election again. Either result is positive for Conservatives.",

He wasn't a politician, he didn't think he was going to win, was unprepared when he did win, and had to rely on Washington ghouls to staff his administration. \n\nHim and his campaign have had 4 years to clarify that mistake and now have a very large list of vatted people ready to serve in his administration.",

But for now, inflation control, border security, crime, housing costs, etc. are what need to be tackled first.\n\nOne conservative point I DO hope they take on is gun rights. I\u2019m really hoping a few unconstitutional gun laws go before the SCOTUS in the next year or so, such \u201cassault weapon\u201d bans.

If someone turns 18 and wants to go trans, whatever. But not minors. \n\nJust one example.",

I think there's a lot of careful navigating he will have to do because even Americans that support closed borders aren't going to take kindly to a brash deportation process.\n\nI bet Trump would win over bipartisan support if the immigration plan includes a very streamlined/simple way for existing productive immigrants with jobs, families, homes, etc. to appeal the deportation via application process.",

He will be able to help reform the executive bureaucracies and attend congressional meetings on what needs to change as well.\n\nAny sort of Department of Efficiency/Department of Government Efficiency could have some serious positive long-term ramifications (though likely some short term pain) for the country, and if done right could actually be a blueprint for other countries and the local states to copy when it comes to clamping down on out-of-control bureaucracy.\n\nSome of this will need to be done with congress help, but there's a lot he can do from the executive level as well.

If he's not, whoever is absolutely, 100%, **NEEDS** to be studying his debates and interviews. \n\nThe reason he's so effective is that he understands the way that the media has grown accustomed to strong-arming right-wing guests into giving them clips to carefully edit and use against them.

Everything else is secondary to the voters and is not worth focusing too much on.",

I think Vance ended up being the best pick, and I think Burgum will do a lot better in a major Cabinet position.",
         "I was not in the thread but I really favored Vivek and couldn't understand the choice. Now I can see why he was chosen for sure. I think it just took time for folks to get to know his style of campaigning.

The election isn't about the popular vote, so why would I  put resources into something that doesn't determine the outcome\". This cycle, we see Trump putting in time in NY doing things like renting out Madison Square Garden, building a voter base in a state that he absolutely would not win. That doesn't change the outcome of the election, but it builds a better narrative for him, and I think that's why we saw more things like the MSG rally.\n\nDemocrats have been complaining about the electoral college since 2004, the last time a Republican won the popular vote, but Trump absolutely showed that Republicans can win whatever game the Democrats want to play. We just have to stick to a principled and common sense platform.\n\nWinning the swing states really was goal number 1, but I think Vance (who will probably be the 2028 candidate) has been given a great blueprint on running a national election as opposed to 50 state elections",

         "I would say Trump being shot unified the party, which was essential for him to do. Maybe that doesn't happen otherwise. So it's a big deal. But I don't think he wins on that alone.\n\nBut I think what won him the election was the alternative media blitz.\n\nGen Z broke big for Trump. \n\nTrump going on podcasts and doing events with Adin Ross, Theo Von, Bryson DeChambeau, Nelk boys, Bussin with the boys, Logan Paul, the Undertaker... And Joe freaking Rogan.... And so many others... This is what Gen Z watches, not SNL or the tonight show (which Kamala went on). These people are where they get news and entertainment from. And Trump gave them long format interviews which Gen Z really got to know Trump directly from the source.\n\nThat's what won him the election, imo.",
         "Someone made an amazing point. If Trump won in 2020, he would not have the house and Senate. It would have been 4 years of hoaxes.\n\nThis is literally the happy ending we all deserve!",
         "I agree.  I think it was then that a lot of fence sitters actually saw that Trump was telling the truth about the swamp and what they would do.",
         " Can't fake a reaction like that. I suspect all the bogus lawfare, Mar-a-Lago raid and mugshot also contributed to his victory in similar ways - his reaction and determination to that onslaught.",
         "I think it's a toss-up between three items:\n\n1. The first debate\n2. The assassination attempt\n3. The fundamentals of life: costs around food and shelter\n\nObviously all of them were impactful in some way, I just don't know which one was the MOST impactful.\n\nHonestly, I'm leaning towards the first debate, because that was the moment I saw a LOT of Democratic voters suddenly say *\"wow, our candidate just cannot do this\"*. Frankly... that sucked the wind out of their sails, and I think a lot of would-be Democrat supporters stayed home because of it.",
         "People kept calling Trump a coward before the attempt. Trump did not back down and showed the world he is no coward.",
         "The assassination attempt was legitimately what motivated me to vote for the first time in my life.",
         "We better pray the secret service does a better job of protecting him because these loonies will not stop.",

         "Nah, he won when Kamala told everyone straight to their faces that she wouldn\u2019t do anything differently than Biden.\n\nAmericans are struggling, why would you say that? \ud83d\ude02\n\nDemocrats - \u201cok, guess I\u2019ll just stay home and not vote then\u201d",
         "Agreed.  I called it as soon as I saw the photo",
         "IMO no candidate short of the actual Adolf Hitler, who was guilty of genocide and unalived himself, has ever been less popular after being shot.\n\nBy uh (hi admins) doing the pew pew kazoo at someone you strongly disagree with, you cement them as a martyr.\n\nAnd before some randos claim that Trump faked it, you don't seriously think that a guy who's worth billions can pay to have his ear fixed and look presentable?",

         "I think it definitely was a big part. I also think Joe Rogan and peanut was the last straw.",
         "I disagree. He was going to win regardless because of how bad the Biden-Harris administration is. The assassination attempt was precisely because the left knew he was going to win too and were desperate to do anything to stop him. They still might.",
         "That, mcdicks fries, and trash man helped\u00a0\n\nBut he won when democrats abruptly booted Biden away from the race. If they\u2019d had a real primary they could\u2019ve picked someone with like plans and goals.",
         "More specifically, the moment Trump won was when Kamala Harris drew the short straw to take the inevitable loss against him. None of the better candidates wanted to risk a Loss on their record.",
         "Could be!\n\nI felt the victory though on July 4th - he had just crushed Biden in the debate and things just suddenly felt different on our nations birthday.",

I have to think that has something to do with Trump gaining 10 points with voters whose incomes are under 50K compared to 2020. \n\nThe middle and lower class voted for Trump, considering exit polls showing his strength in incomes less than 100K.",
         "Nope, inflation\n\nHe was gonna win no matter what",
         "This was something I was heavily pondering for weeks. Polls had Pennsylvania as a dead heat. I just couldn't comprehend how he could possibly lose PA after the assassination attempt and subsequent Butler return rally. It turns out my line of thinking was closer to accurate than the polls.",
         "Iconic moment, but Trump had it won the whole time, the polls were just bad.\n\nAmericans hated the Biden administration and the inflation it brought them.  They were always going to boot him out.",

         "Scott is a true patriot",
         "What did Scott Presler do? I don't know who that is.",
         "Scott Presler _delivered_ PA. Charlie Kirk managed to oust Ronna Romney McDaniel from the RNC and it was clear this year the RNC was _not_ fucking around with Lara Trump at the helm. TPUSA also delivered Wisconsin. Kirk appears to have delivered AZ and NV as well.\n\nCredit where it's due, too, DeSantis and Kemp delivered FL and GA with a nice bow on top. Not sure who was responsible for NC but thanks to them too.",
         "Every bit helps obviously so don't take this the wrong way but I'm waiting until 2026 and 2028 before I'm convinced Pressler actually made a difference. If he can prove himself then, I'll donate and maybe even volunteer myself to whatever cause he's leading.\n\nRight now, Trump's vote total will be around the same as 2020. It seems Trump and Trump alone is the reason for massive voter turnout. If we can replicate it in elections without Trump, then I'll be impressed.",
         "> Gen Z broke big for Trump.\n\nAll the shitposts man. Every time the man spoke there was a meme of him a day later. I saw the \"fact checked by true american patriots\" gif for like 3 years.\n\nThe mugshot was literally everywhere and in so many meme variations.\n\nThe assassination photo was literally recreated on Smash Ultimate's stage builder\n\nThe fuckin AI presidents meme.....I can keep going",
         "Instead we got 4 years of suffering.. Oh well, it will be worth it... God Bless and Protect #47!",
         "Its also when the narrative about him being a fake weak rich baby completely fell apart.",
         "Best scrapbook ever.",
         "Don't forget the garbage truck",
         "Do not discount the importance of the Vance debate, either. Trump lost a lot of momentum in the way he handled the Harris debate, but then Vance gained it right back when he picked Walz apart. Vance showed that he isn't some \"weirdo\" hick from the mountains -- he is actually quite sharp and very well spoken. I have no doubts that this won over quite a few people who were dubious before.\n\nAdding to that was his Rogan interview, where he further demonstrated he is just an ordinary guy trying to make a difference. He is relatable and he is clean. He is exactly what the GOP needed to balance Trump's ego and baggage.",
         "And the mugshot",
         "add in an unlikable opponent who nobody voted for and couldn't name a single policy and you have the biggest republican win in modern history. (Not electoral college wise, but the popular vote alone which had been a struggle for republicans since Reagan)",

         "Is anyone on his campaign even aware of him? He deserves a medal of freedom if those two vote stealers from Georgia are allowed to have one",
         "Since we got MI and WI too, we didn't need PA. Charlie Kirk was up in MI, though, so it was a team effort. I'm not sure if as strong an effort was made in WI, and, right now, it looks like PA and MI voted to the right of WI. That is a change from 2016 and 2020, when WI was the rightest of the three. So that could be a sign that the efforts in MI and PA paid dividends.",
         "He went by county by county in PA and flipped the voter registrations from Dem to GOP by registering low propensity voters. \n\nFor example, Presler worked to flip the voter registrations in Bucks County and Trump ended up flipping the county from blue to red in the general yesterday.",
         "He's spent almost every day of the last 4 years in Pennsylvania registering as many people to vote for Republicans/Trump as possible",
         "As well as the two other comments state of him registering voters he\u2019s also just a good human being. He\u2019s done a lot for communities, in Baltimore for example he organized a massive clean up on the city streets",
         "> Not sure who was responsible for NC but thanks to them too.\n\nThat was me :)\n\nJoke's aside, NC is sliding toward being a fully red state.  Like Florida, a lot of conservatives moved here during covid for less restrictions.\n\nWe've had shit luck with terrible GOP governor options the past few elections, but the state legislature is majority GOP and up till one seat flipped this last time it was a GOP supermajority.",
         "I hear what you\u2019re saying but the sheer number of new registered republican voters in the state of PA proves he made a significant difference. The numbers of registered voters in multiple PA counties flipped from democrats majority to republican majority. Trump would\u2019ve won without PA, knowing that now, but not even from a finite tangible numbers aspect, the man has worked incredibly hard to shape the identity and personality of what a republican/conservative voter actually looks like and who they are. The media has painted us as racist, misogynistic, sexist etc etc and every interaction I\u2019ve seen regarding Scott Presler is how nice and kind he is which provides an immeasurable impact to the perception of a candidate and their party",

         "Do you have a link to the smash ultimate one?\u00a0",
         "The silver lining to suffering for 4 years is that we now have a much stronger and more unified GOP. The world now knows who Vance is, and if things go well these next 4 years, I think he has a great chance in 2028.\n\nThere's also a golden opportunity now permanently repair some of the damage the Dems did and put safeguards in place to keep them from breaking it again. Mass deportations must happen, and we also must have federally-mandated voter ID requirements. Just by virtue of requiring ID to vote, it will cut down on illegal immigration because the Dems will no longer have as much of an incentive to allow wide open borders.\n\nThere also needs to be stringent requirements placed on who is eligible to utilize mail-in ballots. It should *only* be an option for those who can prove they are physically handicapped (i.e. you have handicapped vehicle registration), those over 65, and those who are deployed as active duty, civilians, or contractors supporting the military.\n\nHell, while at it, pass a 15 week national abortion law. Anything goes until 15 weeks, and after that you must have a medically justifiable reason (such as safety of the mother or grave anomalies in the fetus) to terminate. This is as fair of a compromise as you can get and I think it will placate the majority of people. Doing this will serve two purposes: 1) It will take away a major talking point the Dems use every single election cycle. 2) It prevents Dems from later passing a law allowing something much more insidious, such as third trimester abortions.",

He went viral for this video:\n\nhttps://fb.watch/vHZIK4mzt5/\n\nHe was cleaning up the streets of San Francisco, when some Karen decided to confront him.  He went on a tirade, and then vowed to bring Trump back into office.  He moved to a swing state, PA, and made it his mission to swing that state back to Red.  He and his PAC is pretty much responsible for swinging that state Red.\n\nTrump needs to give him some award or medal.",

         "It really is undeniable that that was a major push for gen z voters. All we do is shitpost and he is the shitpost king. You could feel the momentum he had ever since the mugshot.

However, it needs to be left up to the states as getting Roe V Wade overturned has done. There is a balance that needs to be hit.

The term \"democracy\" is used (edit: in contrast to a republic) in the Federalist Papers (no. 14):\n\n>The error which limits republican government to a narrow district has been unfolded and refuted in preceding papers. I remark here only that it seems to owe its rise and prevalence chiefly to the confounding of a republic with a democracy, applying to the former reasonings drawn from the nature of the latter. The true distinction between these forms was also adverted to on a former occasion. It is, that in a democracy, the people meet and exercise the government in person; in a republic, they assemble and administer it by their representatives and agents. A democracy, consequently, will be confined to a small spot. A republic may be extended over a large region.\n\nThe author argues that a common misconception limits republican government to small areas, stemming from confusion between a republic and a democracy. In a democracy, the people govern directly, so it is practical only in small regions. In contrast, a republic operates through representatives, allowing it to govern larger territories. This distinction, previously discussed, highlights how a republic can succeed over a vast area where a direct democracy could not.\n\nThe more you know.",

They are only \"smart enough\" to target and agitate the already immoral and uneducated portions of society. Much of the working class and minorities found out in the Obama years that the agitation and promises were just tools to garner their vote. Biden/Harris put the nails in the Dem coffin by going even further left, and being even more blatant in their tactics. They did the same thing leftists do when I debate them in forums. They just double down on their dishonest narrative, and then buy support from \"celebrities\" who are nothing more than paid actors. \n\nI'm glad the wiles of the left are being exposed, and all the creepy people who come out of the woodwork to endorse for dollars are being exposed along with them.",

Other than Mark Cuban, did Kamala have a single celebrity endorser actually go on the campaign trail for her?\n\nThen you look at the celebs that endorsed Donald Trump. Many of them are long time outspoken conservatives that suffered serious harm to their careers when they became politically active (i.e. Mel Gibson). Most of their endorsements isn't just one statement, but actively campaigning on behalf of Trump. Be it James Woods on X constantly posting about Trump and politics, or Musk holding town halls in Pennsylvania. The endorsers that do make just one rally appearance will usually go up there and wing it. If they have a prepared statement to give, it'll be book ended by crowd work and they seem like they're genuinely having fun.\n\nSo no, I don't think the problem is that it's a celebrity. It's that they don't actually want to be there.",

She only got 3 months to prepare. It doesn't help that she was even polling lower than Biden during Biden's win\n\nApart from shooting themselves in the foot like they did with Hillary, she never actually managed to bring people to her. Hardcore dems/reps weren't ever going to switch their vote. However, she never gave moderates & undecided voters a reason to switch to her. She was more Anti-Trump than Pro-Harris, if that makes sense.\n\nShe was doomed to fail from both her own campaign and her party, is essentially my belief. If they ran someone else that wasn't Biden or Kamala **when** they should have, I think it would've been closer or even another blue administration for 2024.\n\nRegardless, I'm glad Trump won, but I'm really wanting 2028 election to be more like the VP debate of professionalism and actual solutions.",

It\u2019s pretty little easy to lose during all that. He handled Covid pretty shit regardless of its actual severity. This campaign would\u2019ve been so much easier for him. Had he just left gracefully. They also extended voting now if you want to cry foul on that, that\u2019s the only ground you have to stand on. It\u2019s the only legitimate one.",
         "I mean, considering the last two years of Trump's presidency were a shitshow, directly or indirectly by his own hand (2019 and 2020), I can see a lot of people desesperate to get him out to vote against him.\n\nKnew a lot of Trump supporters wanting him out in 2020 (and then, ironically, back rn).\n\nI am just glad this is over.

         "Trump was saying 10-20% on ALL imports. Not just China. This was pitched as a blanket import policy. If only the debate actually debated policy, and not just compared rally crowd sizes.",
         "Trump himself toned the rhetoric waaay down. Maybe just getting older that\u2019s done it, or the near death experiences on the campaign trail. But it\u2019s a good sign that we need to come together now\u2026 not apart. \n\nThe aggressive people pointing fingers and scapegoating demographics need to know; this is our country, and we are UNITED.

         "Would you say the short-term effects would last longer than 4 years? Would this swing the pendulum too far back to the left for the next election and potentially alienate voters who feel they are worse off with the high cost of things, then the next incumbent could do away with it? How will this differ from the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930? Very concerned about the impact of that as it seems like a similar strategy and it worsened the Great Depression.",
         "Then why aren't you doing that currently?",
         "A 20% tariff in most cases won\u2019t switch us over to American manufacturing. Chinese products are much cheaper than a 20% tariff compared to American. So nothing changes, and you pay more.",

Most people complained about inflation and rising prices, tariffs are inflationary because the cost will be passed to the consumer in the form of higher prices. You\u2019re right that if it\u2019s tariffs on bs no one needs, we\u2019re fine but the reality is there\u2019s gonna be tariffs on much more than just that.\n\nHere\u2019s an even more recent example than \u00a0Smoot-Hawley:\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_United_States_steel_tariff",

         "That is a terrible idea, with how the government is structured right now there is not a single way that tariffs could ever replace income tax. I\u2019m aware that the total value of imports is in the ball park of how much revenue is made from income tax. But let\u2019s say there\u2019s a flat 10% tariff on all goods, that\u2019s 10% of the previous revenue. And that is also not taking into account how much imports would go down as people can\u2019t afford to buy as much.",
         "I guess I'm just confused on why you'd want to pay more for the stuff you already buy, in that case.",
         "Do you think they\u2019re going to price match every product ever to make the tariffs outweigh Chinese imports? There is no realistic scenario here where the consumer isn\u2019t royally screwed by this, and the economy is negatively impacted significantly. It\u2019s a bad idea plain and simple."

The fact that she ran in 2020 with the most liberal position likely ever for a nominee and never even clarified it in this election. It makes her seem disingenuous in my eyes.",

         "It's actually kinda what makes me think we're not ready for a president who isn't a white hetero man. During the Obama administration any criticism was dismissed as racism. Hillary's loss was blamed on sexism. Now Harris lost and they're blaming sexism and racism. If we're not allowed to judge certain groups of people on their merit they shouldn't be in charge.",
         "This is true.  But the odd thing is it's fluid.  If Vance follows Trump's term as the next Republican candidate, it'll become VDS.  A year ago, they wouldn't have even known his name.  Whoever it is next, watch and see.  These leftists are part of a cult.",
         "In their own way, yeah. You need only look at all the posts about how they are so intelligent and open minded, while Trump supporters are close-minded and ignorant. They think they are being rational, sensible people who are 'accepting of differences' and so on.",

I bet they'd lose momentum. \n\nA large part of why this election ended up the way it did is because Trump has been FAR quieter than years past.\n\nEven CNN all day today has been so much more accepting and moderate than I expected. It doesn't appear they're ramping up for anti-Trump 24/7 rhetoric at this point, and I wonder if he remains calm and doesn't say anything too crazy, the hatred for him dies down some.",

My doctor is from Scotland and a specialist I see, she is from Pakistan. They are both very good doctors. However, as soon as I state that I\u2019m against illegal immigration and how it\u2019s not only damaging to the lower wage working citizens across the country, but also unfair to those who come here using the legal process, I get yelled at for being racist and hating immigrants. It blows my mind.",

         "You can blame Obama for that. He started this crap. I too remember a time before all this division. This is all directly out of the socialists Alinsky playbook. Divide us up, inject hatred and distrust so that we can\u2019t have inter-group conversations and discover we have far more in common and the true \u201cenemies\u201d are the elites.  There are way more of us than there are of them and they know it.",

         "I have a degree in philosophy.  I also have a tech degree for industrial maintenance.  I voted red.  I must be uneducated.",
         "I think that\u2019s one of the major differences between legal and illegal immigrants. I\u2019ve consistently seen legal immigrants say they consider themselves American but illegal immigrants who have been here for a decade still consider themselves as being whatever country they\u2019re from and they\u2019ll wave that flag exclusively, but never the American flag. This isn\u2019t true in every single case, obviously, but overall it\u2019s been what I\u2019ve seen. It seems like the hard work needed to become a legal citizen really drives home the fact that they are now American just like the rest of the US citizens.",
         "You\u2019re probably successful too, because you integrated into the culture and took advantage of what was available rather than using all your effort to make the place you came more like the place you left. \nSeems to be a theme among all immigrants that are successful in the U.S.: they don\u2019t try to bring their home country to their new country.",
         "It definitely varies. My husband\u2019s family came here legally when my husband was a toddler, but my MIL still refers to Peru as \u201cher country.\u201d Never made sense to me honestly, since she and my FIL chose to leave Peru and start a new life here, and she\u2019s been living in the USA for over half her life at this point. She\u2019s even a naturalized US citizen now. I\u2019ve never heard her talk about the US with the same pride she takes in talking about Peru.",
         "Yeah that\u2019s weird. Eastern European immigrants seem to default to calling their ancestral homeland \u201cthe old country\u201d, which seems to indicate an acknowledgment, but not allegiance."

         "The biggest tell about the 2020 election was that you were not allowed to question it and they ignored our concerns (to the point they relentlessly mocked us). If they were innocent and there was truly nothing to see then they would have wanted to talk about it because 1) it would have been a win for them to debunk Trump on the merits to his face in front of his supporters and 2) it would have reduced tensions in the country for people to feel their concerns were taken seriously instead of dismissed without any real investigation, media coverage, public debate, or trial on the merits. Transparency in elections is important if you actually believe in democracy, and they did everything to prevent transparency after 2020 which tells you all you need to know. People who think they are innocent do not act that way.\n\nThey ignored sworn testimony under penalty of perjury and didn't even bother to look into it. The media declared immediately with nothing but blind assertions and argument from authority that it was \"debunked\" and \"baseless\". \"We 'investigated' ourselves and found we did nothing wrong\".\n\nWhat makes it even worse for elections is that we don't have access to a lot of info that only the government does and if they prevent access to it we can't verify claims from poll workers and validate integrity of the process. I personally still believe the main way they cheated in 2020 was with mail ballots and that if they properly ignored those with mismatched signatures as required by law the democrats would have easily lost. It's why to this day not a single state allowed us to check signatures after the one 100 ballot random sample the Arizona court ordered showed between 5% and 11% didn't match. The judge ruled that because the ballot still had personal info that matched the voter on it like their phone number that was enough... even though they didn't follow up to actually see if that person really voted, not to mention that's not the law. So yeah, 2020 was a joke and their response to our concerns about it is what should have given it away to anyone who was on the fence.",

      "text": "As many of you already know, Reddit is melting down. People are pretty quiet, and the bots seemed to be gone. But the state subs are melting down big time. In Washington, people are melting down so much. I did have to do a victory lap, but then I got serious. When I told people on there that we can move forward and unify the country, and that our best years are ahead of us. They were not happy with that and did not support it. I truly believe that now is the time to unify, and that our best years are ahead. I\u2019m really looking forward to the next four years, not only of course because of the results but also just life. What are you seeing on Reddit, and for those who have been out and about, what are you seeing?\n",

         "Sacramento, CA Reddit has people asking how they tell their children that Kamala lost.",
         "The most ~~surprising~~ saddening thing to me is how basically all of Reddit skews so far to the left. I live in one of the reddest states in the country, and going to the subreddit, you'd think it were as blue as DC.",
         "Yes, the Ohio sub is in tatters.  Some poster started off his rant with \"I know we are all in a dour mood today.....\" and I replied back with \"Not all of us are, in fact, 55.2% of us are pretty happy today!\"  I was downvoted into oblivion and have quite a few \"chat requests\" with very colorful language and imaginative suggestions on where I can stick my head.  LOL",
         "It\u2019s been hilarious in the Texas sub watching people try to understand that the only age group Kamala won is 25-29 year olds. Trump won the 18-24 year olds lmao",
         "Texas sub legitimately thought Cruz would lose and Texas would only go to Trump by 2-3 points, or maybe even that Harris could win it.\n\nTrump won Texas by 14%. These people are unhinged and detached from reality",
         "Texas sub is so aggressively liberal that any conservative thoughts are immediately downvoted to oblivion. I\u2019m pleased to see them deal with the reality of our great state!",
         "But the Selzer poll",

         "Because they aren\u2019t real\n\nThey are propaganda subs",
         "They have been conditioned to think that their way is the only righteous one and that anything else is 'insert ism here'.\n\nAs a result, they're not interested in moving forward or unifying, because they are immature children that lost the spelling bee and will never forgive the winner for winning.",
         "On threads. You got angry feminists freaking out. Got people wanting to leave Florida. It's a melt down of epic proportions",
         "BTW, for my state Washington. We didn\u2019t win a single statewide office. Wasn\u2019t close. I did a lot of campaigning. This is the nail in the coffin for Washington, but at least Trump can mess with Ferguson. Regardless of who won the election in Washington, I was already planning on leaving for Wyoming. And now that can\u2019t come soon enough, looking forward to living in the best state in the Union!!",
         " The Texas sub is hilarious.",
         "Missouri is in hysterics as well, I don\u2019t visit my state sub because I know it\u2019s filled with people who are terminally online",

         "As each state turned red, my friends and I were going on to that state\u2019s sub and watching the meltdown.\n\nIt was quite the shitshow",
         "Tired of hearing unity, we arent the ones who tried to assassinate a former president. Not the ones who use the courts politically. Not the ones who used the media to attack one candidate unfairly. I hope we stack the courts and I hope we stack all the agencies. Time to entrench and also enact national voting security.",

         "Think the state subs are bad? Check out the Ukraine subs.",
         "I'm trying to spread some rationality around on reddit but people just aren't having it today. Lots of people are angry and looking for people to blame, it's gonna wreck a lot of relationships since Harris supporters can't seem to be mature about people's voting choices. Harris campaign really did a number on a lot of people with their fear tactics, I guess it works to get them to the polls but in the case of a loss it completely destroys their mental well-being since they think the world is going to end now.",
         "It's not just state subs. Other subs are also melting down. Sports, gaming, ya know topics that don't have anything to do with politics all of a sudden are saying the \"USA will become a fascist country and women's lives will be in danger.\"",
         "Man you should see the PA sub.  Since PA was the \u201ckey\u201d to Trumps election (even though he would of still won because of WI and MI) they are taking it super hard.  As a PA conservative who voted for Trump 3 times, I\u2019m super proud of my state today and cherish every single salty tear from those communists.",

         "Their bubble burst",
         "Forget the state subreddits and go look at my cities subreddit. \n\nChicago\u2026my lord was is bad before but today it\u2019s beyond words how the Liberals can\u2019t fathom and are outraged how the folks or all colors, members of the LGB community and god forbid WOMEN didn\u2019t vote exactly how they expected them to vote. \n\nThen they\u2019re now bashing the rest of Illinois calling them all welfare recipients that we here in Chicago are keeping afloat. \n\nThis is what happens when you\u2019re so far removed from not only your neighbors and communities but reality as a whole. God forbid we voted for a better quality of life now and for our communities and to put each other first over laundering money to other countries who don\u2019t care about us.\n\nThis is what happens when you call people Nazis, Uncle Toms, The wrong kind of immigrant and tell women to shut the fuck up.",
         "Just something new to be the victim for.",
         "R/politics is basically only kamala wins such and such state lol.",
         "They are extremely agitated. Some are already talking impeachment before he makes it to the office",
         "The propaganda is still in full swing. The top post on Georgia when I looked this morning was someone talking about how they are \"scared to get pregnant now\". Most of the top comments were urging the OP to move to a blue state.\n\nSounds like the system is working as intended.\n\nEdit: I just noticed that the top 10 or so posts are all locked. I'd say the meltdown is definitely melting down.",
         "I'm cartman drinking the tears of Scott Tenorman.\n\nBut in this episode Scott Tenorman is played by the liberals on reddit.\n\nIt's glorious.",

         "The Nashville sub is awful",
         "Glorious!",
         "I also think this is a great time to unify. Independents, moderate liberals and conservatives can find a lot in common, and the general citizenry of the U.S. needs to realize this. \n\nThe far left (just as the far right, which fortunately has little to no political influence in this country) has no place in our politics. There just isn't any compromise to be had with anyone hell bent on the destruction of our country.",
         "Real zinger on slash nytimes. Some real threats in that one.  They've lost it.",
         "We're all feeling a little giddy. But I will say, if we want unity to be our main message, we probably shouldn't be describing the people who we want to court as \"melting down.\"\n\nThat's just going to reinforce what they think.",
         "What happened to NH? I thought it went from purple to Red? At least maybe last election that happened.\n\nFriggen mass residents all flocked there.\n\nI don\u2019t trust the dems they are really gonna try to come back in full force in 2028. Their reaction to these elections results is concerning, unsettling and disturbing\n\nAt first I found it sad and tried to show some sympathy. But they\u2019re hateful and wildly ignorant.  they aren\u2019t acting like adults AT ALL. Seeing all the posts they aren\u2019t functioning like adults over the results. They are literally crying and coming undone.\n\n\u2026and THESE are the people that want to be taken seriously?!!",

         "The North Carolina sub is strangely, and pleasantly, quiet. The bots have definitely departed. I also resisted the urge to spike and do a victory dance, but I do so much want to post the hilary crying chick! I quote the sage, Dylan: \"How does it feeeeeeeel?\"",

         "Im.sorry but call me -or anyone- trash, racist, a dictator supporter for years. Unification is me fighting in the narketplace of ideas for exactly what I believe tooth and nail.\n\nUnification is not playing nice. That's what leads to corruption and bad compromise in the first place",
         "While unity is a nice thought, it's never gonna happen. Too many radical people on the left. The people who want to work together have already joined Trump anyways",

         "IMPORTANT NOTE! Many MANY subs are trying to reflect on what went wrong, who voted who didn\u2019t vote, what they could do to change this for next time. Even the dentistry sub is wondering how this will affect their career.\n\n\nBasically trump hasn\u2019t even taken his seat yet as president again and they are already *getting ready* for 2028. \n\nI genuinely think they are going to do everything in their power to \u201cget back\u201d at us in 2028. \n\nPlease just keep this in mind and DONT reply to their comments and posts with ideas on why they lost. Don\u2019t help them out!!!",

         "Young people are getting to the age where many of them were raised by far left parents, and they're bucking back. \n\nThe thing the far left people don't realize is that their lack of ability to be more moderate is going to affect the younger generations.\n\nRedditors *should* be talking unity because they learned a very hard lesson today about the views of average Americans. They're foolish to double down. They're only making it less and less likely they'll win future elections.",
         "According to The View, Trump also won over the  \"uneducated white woman\" demographic.\n\nSo they're blaming white women for the loss lol. And we're the racists.",

         "Trump won Texas by about double what he was projected to win it by.  14% is a curb stomping.  You are right though, if these are even real people they are almost pathologically delusional.",

         "They can\u2019t. They are accustomed to seeing immigrants pouring over the US southern border and think it\u2019s like that everywhere. The US has the most lenient immigration laws in the western world.\u00a0\n\nAnywhere else they would want to go- Europe, New Zealand, Australia, etc, you have to be inherently wealthy, *or* have a white collar job already lined up plus a substantial net worth. And that\u2019s just to get your foot in the door- the process from there is very lengthy and arduous.\u00a0\n\nAll the other western nations only accept the best and brightest. And they have to be certain that you will not be a drain on their robust social nets.\u00a0\n\nRedditors do not understand this. They think you can just buy a one way ticket to Amsterdam with $200 in your pocket and figure it out once you get there. Doesn\u2019t work like that.",

He's not even playing the victim: he wrote, directed, starred in and edited the victim complex blockbuster of the year. This dude is Jim Jones level of buying into cult propaganda\u00a0",

         "I do often wonder why Reddit skews so hard left. \n\nI'm in a red state, and even the leftist people I know IRL aren't so hardcore. What is it that attracts these hardcore leftists to Reddit? And why am I here?\n\nIt's wild that subs I enjoy (weddingplanning, handbags, nycinfluencersnark etc.), which are topics that typically involve people with good jobs, are so heavily left right now.",
         "We are only seeing flaired user comments.  There are more, but they are shadowbanned for the unflaired.  In other words, they think their posts are visible but they aren't visible to anyone but them.",

These people truly live in a bubble.",

         "I want to believe it is, but the left holds onto their mistaken version of Popper's Paradox of Tolerance so hard that it is impossible to just talk about things with them.\n\nI think that is the biggest issue, the left just refuses to talk and attributes right wing views as necessarily coming from a place of malice. No application of Hanlon's Razor at all.\n\nCombine that with the arrogance that they are \"intellectual\" and their positions are \"obviously correct\", and it makes it so that even when you can somehow get one of them to have a conversation that it ends up being the equivalent of talking to a wall.",
         "No, the left is too far gone. What is evident is no one believes most of them anymore. Try to make your case and hit em with facts and it is the same ad hom attack of \"you hate women\" and \"you are racist.\" The lady screaming at the baby is how far low they have gone. Them trying to preach civility is a one way street for them.  The other thing is, look at how we consume media and information now. We watch Youtube, we listen to podcasts and talk radio to find some semblance of reality. Because we don't see it in other forms.  Alot of us discuss these things in forums because we cannot in the outside world. We used to be able to congregate and discuss policy and respectfully agree among our peers. Some of us still do, but not like we used to.",

         "The sad part is the Chicago sub is better than the state sub.\n\nI saw someone mention there that Illinois was closer than Iowa and that if you excluded Cook country Illinois would have gone for Trump.\n\nOf course, that just makes them seethe even more about \"downstate\" and voting \"against their own interest\".",

         "After 24 years of being called a fascist, Nazi, and race-traitor by the progressives, calling their petulant reactions a melt-down is overwhelming gracious IMHO.\n\nThey do this EVERY ELECTION they \"lose\" I've voted in: 2000, 2004, 2010\\*, 2016, and now 2024. Meanwhile they are smug as hell in every election they win.\n\n(\\*2010 was not a Presidential election, but a big red swing, and people all over the college I work at were getting \"emergency therapy\" and breaking down on the quad over an off-year legislature election.

         "The right call would've been not lying about his cognitive issues and forcing an actual primary when they had time to build a real campaign with a candidate actually chosen by the people.",
         "Dropping Biden was the right call - his polling took a dump after the debate - not doing a mini primary was moronic.",
         "Dropping Biden was the right call, but made far too late in the game. They knew long before that fateful debate that he went off his rocker yet thought they could continue to hide it.\n\nThey made things worse by appointing Kamala the new nominee which pissed off not just conservatives, but a lot of moderates who leaned more left as well as many registered democrats. She was already unpopular, and just handing her the nomination made things worse.",
         "The proper decision was dropping Biden but it clearly should\u2019ve been done way earlier",
         "Ridin' with Biden would've been better. If he dropped Harris as V.P. and replaced her with John Fetterman, he might've been able to hold the blue wall. It would've given them the same security Vance gave to Trump voters. A safe, normal, decent person to take over if the elderly candidate dies or has to get constitutionally removed.",
         "Dropping Biden was the right call, but they did it too late. They should have had a primary.",
         "I think the Democrats dropping Biden was a good call. If they stuck with Biden, they would\u2019ve easily lost states like Minnesota, Virginia, and New Hampshire. Possibly even more than that.\n\nThe problem was dropping him way too late. That gave Democrats no time to get a new campaign up and running in comparison to Trump (<120 days vs. 2 years). The new Democratic candidate they installed only made their bad hand worse.",
         "You are just \"the help\" to them the same way they think Latino people are for cleaning toilets or sheet rocking. They just happen to think you are smarter and task you with more complex jobs. Plus they get to show you off and then pat themselves on the back for how inclusive they are.",

Unusable. Untouchable.\n\nBesides that, I remain convinced that the rising Democrats knew perfectly well that Trump was going to win back in July. He was miles ahead, there was only a hundred days to go, and they all have 2028 aspirations. No one wants a loss on their record, it\u2019s much easier to run as the challenger after four years of Trump. Why do you think that Newsom and Whitmer were among the first to take themselves out of consideration for VP?",
         "Even without the primary. At a minimum go to a contested convention. At least there you have representative delegates making the decision. I understand the money reason behind running Harris but without any semblance of a vetting process just seemed like a terrible idea.",

         "Yang could have been an highly successful politician, but he was utterly dedicated to committing electoral self-harm over and over again.",
         "Yup. And as soon as the people started trying to pick Bernie again, they fired up the ol media and DNC machine and put an end to that.\n\nThis election also to me shows Biden absolutely would not have won without the COVID rules.",
         "FEC regulations.",
         "I have also held the same theory. They don't have a deep bench though. Newsom is going to be a tough sell anywhere other than in already solid blue areas. Not sure about Whitmer, I need to learn more about her.",
         "They still would have anointed whoever they wanted with superdelegates, haha.",
         "John Fetterman would be the smart pick. Just like Biden, start off with a guy with a huge advantage in Pennsylvania, and working class appeal (PA governor Shapiro does NOT have that). Then hope that extends to Michigan and Wisconsin, you have your blue wall, and you've all but won. He would blunt Vance's clear advantage in rural areas.",
         "That's not a bad call at all. I actually kinda like Fetterman too so it wouldn't be the end of the world if he won."

         "Exactly this.",

         "I agree.",
         "Where are you getting 20 million from? \u00a0Maybe 7 million from what I can tell.",
         "This is exactly it. There was absolutely 0 enthusiasm for Biden in 2020. However wrong or misinformed it was, there *was* enthusiasm for Harris but somehow 15 mil less people came out for her? No way",
         "You know he\u2019s gonna have two paintings. I so want the second one to be his mugshot. Would be bad ass hanging in the White House."

         "If the media can be so obviously in the pocket of Dems, then so can pollsters. I had the exact same thoughts after seeing leftist news sources so confidently saying that the race is tight or that Kamala would win on the night before the election.\n\nIt was totally crazy to me that depending on what media bubble you're in, you're getting entirely different poll results. Now that we've seen the actual outcome, was anyone surprised that these leftist pollsters where clearly putting their thumb on the scale in an attempt to 'energize' the Dem voting base?",
         "Also in hindsight it's obvious that the Harris campaign knew.  The tone of the rallies shifted, they pulled out of North Carolina, the mood got desperate.  They knew because their own polls showed them the truth, but they kept the finger on the scale of the public ones to hope for something to give them a chance.",
         "The pollsters are run by the media so yeah exactly",
         "\"your vote is secret, no one will know if you vote for us\"\n\n\nThat's a really weird tone they had in their ad campaign, like they knew voting for them was something people would generally find embarrassing to do. Democrats used to be the \"cool\" vote\u00a0"

         "Hilarious question.....though absolutely germane. I also wonder how many Republicans over the next two years will entertain the same thought - removing the filibuster - while the Dems use it to thwart Trump's agenda?\n\nThe filibuster had merit when there was a degree of consensus in US politics. One hopes there is at least some movement back those conditions. Before the filibuster was tossed for federal court nominees, Ruth Bader Ginzburg, a radical leftist, was approved for the Supreme Court by over 90 Senators. Republicans hated her ideology and could have filibustered, but they recognized the prerogative of the President to appoint the Justice of his choice and behaved accordingly. The Dems poisoned that well with their treatment of Clarence Thomas and Brett Cavanaugh. The Republicans became equally partisan by preventing even a vote on Obama's Garland nomination....(God, what a terrible AG he turned out to be!).\n\nI don't know how we can ever get back to consensus politics in America. It was both good and bad, creating conditions for compromise....but also perpetuating the swamp.",
