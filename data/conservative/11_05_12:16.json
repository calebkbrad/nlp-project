Also, it really came down to a handfuls of races being lost by poor candidates. Sure, Trump picked them but it's common that a Presidential candidate's appeal can't transfer over regardless of endorsement.\u00a0\n\n\nTrump honestly has everything going for him this time. He's much better campaigning as the opposition then he is as the incumbent, the economy, immigration, foreign policy all on his side.\u00a0\n\n\nKamala had to replace a guy who was going to lose in a landside, she's barely a better candidate and she's part of the current admin.

You can post up to four times per hour, even if all four are right after another.\n\nThe websites leftists use to pay for downvotes charge by the downvote, rather than by the hour of labor. So more posts means you drain their pre-paid account more quickly. Because posts downvoted to \u201czero\u201d tend to have more than one downvote, when there is more posts, paid brigading is more costly than when there are just a few posts, but with some upvotes.\n\nThat is a strategy against paid brigading, but it is not as effective against volunteer brigading. To wear them out, you\u2019d need even more posts.\n\nWhen the brigading is really bad, the mods might consider putting a sticky note up announcing that the four posts per hour limit has been suspended temporarily. Then conservatives could just post dozens of links each at a time until eventually it wears out the brigade.\n\nWould this actually work? I don\u2019t know, but it would be interesting to give it a try.\n\nAll leftists need is a credit card, and there are white collar workers in third world countries who will be happy to downvote whatever they want.\n\nSome Reddit users have described in the past spending what appears to be in the thousands of dollars on paid votes. It isn\u2019t cheap to put food on the table for hundreds of people halfway around the world.\n\nThe cost of 50 downvotes is $16.99, which comes out to $0.3398 per downvote.

Same kind of people that might mess with an actual real life election.\n\nBut I accept that Reddit is twisted as sort of a fact of life. What I\u2019d be interested in seeing is a stickied title modeled as a charitable drive.\n\nLike\n\n**Today lets try and feed people from far off lands.

(Also though, It\u2019s about time.) \n\nI\u2019m putting myself in his shoes and even for someone who is unapologetically himself it takes moxie to endorse someone as hated as Trump when you have the top podcast in the world.

My guess is bc they know peoples minds are made up and its such a 50/50 they need to get new voters out to the polls to win. The left has women esp gen z women and the right has some minority men and are now going after first time or apathetic gen z/millenial males.",

There is a total difference between speaking out loud in public vs. texting someone in private. Private conversations are where you TEST ideas and theories before you settle on what you really believe. That can be done by playing devil's advocate. Or essentially trolling, where you say something provocative to try and get a discussion going. Not to mention a private conversation with a friend involves shorthand, where you do not need to put in the same qualifiers and explanations that you would in a public speech. They know that something you say may not be meant to be taken literally.",

         "I'll start off with what I do like:\n\n1. He's open to having anyone on. He had Dr Malone on during peak COVID crazy despite the left trying to destroy him for it. He had Trump, Vance, and Fetterman on in the last two weeks and would have had Harris on if she had a brain.\n\n2. He's long-form. Short-form is just a series of soundbytes and recitals of obedience to dogmas. Rogan basically made this format and it's wonderful.\n\n3. He's generally libertarian and moved to my hometown because California is bullshit.\n\nWhat I don't like:\n\n1. I don't care about MMA, feats of strength or chimps.\n\n2. He doesn't push back enough with bullshit artists. I'm talking Eric Weinstein. I've been made to watch his interactions with this douchemonkey and it has left me irreversibly annoyed with him.\n\nI like Rogan as a person and like what he's done to national discourse, I just don't want to listen to his show. I'm not throwing shade at him or people who enjoy him. My initial comment maybe was too extreme sounding.",

They\u2019d rather nuke every relationship they have than admit they were wrong. Their entire political ideology is based around avoiding any sense of personal accountability.",

         "I loved her Fox show too. O'Reilly and Megyn back-to-back were must-see TV for me for years. I can't stand any of the Fox prime time lineup ever since they booted Bill. It's totally predictable listening to three hard-line conservatives say the exact same talking points every day. The fact that Bill and Megyn were more unpredictable, and at least made it a point to challenge conservatives, simply made their shows more interesting to watch. If a Republican makes a mistake, the Fox prime time hosts now are so partisan that they will not acknowledge it. They'll just spin for them.\n\nMegyn has definitely said she's become more conservative now. I think she rated herself a 6-7 out of 10 recently on conservatism, which seems a little low. Years ago when Howard Stern asked her what her politics were, she said conservative on economics, liberal on social issues. She also said she voted for Trump in 2020 and 2024, and I assume that means she didn't in 2016. Her show now is definitely more to the right of her Fox show, but she will criticize Republicans if she thinks they made a mistake (she didn't like the non-Trump speakers at the Madison Square Garden rally much at all).",
         "Rogan doesn't seem to be in the \"pushback\" business. He actually reminds me more of Johnny Carson than any other talk show host these days. No guest had to worry about Carson digging up dirt on them or trying to debate them on the show. Some people blame Carson for helping promote Paul Ehrlich's devastatingly wrong junk science population doomsday theories when he had him on as a guest. But Carson's style was not to debate, disprove or discredit anyone. He simply gave them a platform and let them make whatever case they wanted to make. Watch him interview Siskel and Ebert, two supremely opinionated guys, and, even then, Carson never brings strong opinions of his own into the interview. He always maintained the kind of agreeable tone that Rogan had with Trump.\n\nFull disclosure, I've only watched a handful of Rogan interviews. But the Trump one gave me major flashbacks to Carson, in that Rogan did not insert his own opinions into the discussion very much, and was very gentle with how he addressed any controversial topics.\n\nI'd theorize that this moderate and even-handed approach is why Rogan is at the top of the heap of his industry, just as Carson was.",

They suddenly claim the economy is doing VERY well and blame any evidence of the contrary on Trump. They know what they\u2019re supporting and that it doesn\u2019t work but they\u2019re too proud to admit it and will still vote for it out of arrogance and ego.",

My guts tell me that the range of possibilities run from a squeaker Kamala victory to a substantial Trump win in the electoral college....and a squeaker Trump victory to a substantial Kamala win in the popular vote.

The GOP has been trying to enforce strict mail-in rules for years, but that's only because the ballots were overwhelmingly from Democrats. The strategy to reject more ballots makes no sense if they want Republicans to switch to mail-in voting (However, in PA, the mail-in vote remained overwhelmingly Democrat this year.
