Republicans getting a majority in Congress.\n2. Republican legislators actually caring enough about DC to fix its problems.\n\n2 is actually the biggest hurdle. Even though Congress is a custodian for DC, the people we elect don\u2019t give a damn about maintaining it, because it doesn\u2019t influence their chances of being elected in other parts of the country.\n\nAnd also they don\u2019t have to live there. If we forced Congress to live in DC, the problems would get fixed over night.\n\nIt\u2019s one of the things missing from the Constitution.

And it got that way because of neglect from Congress, which is in charge of DC but doesn\u2019t have to live there.\n\nForce Congress to live in DC, and DC would become a livable city. That won\u2019t magically flip it red, but it would no longer be 90% Democrat.",
         "DC is mostly ghetto actually. The educated and government workers in DC proper is a minority \u2014 most actually live outside DC in Virginia or Maryland suburbs. There\u2019s only like a couple neighborhoods in DC that could be considered gentrified enough for middle class people to live there, and even those neighborhoods are kind of sketchy.\n\nSo it\u2019s more than being an East Coast city. Democrats have a monopoly on pretty much all ghettos in America, because sane people don\u2019t want to live there."

         "Yep. There's a few early scenarios for how long a night it's going to be.\n\nIf both GA and NC go blue, it's over, Trump needs all three of PA/MI/WI to win, which is unlikely. So the moment any of those flip blue as well, it's over. Early night. This is almost impossible unless the polls have been **MASSIVELY** off, but it's the only early night for Harris scenario.\n\nIf one of GA/NC go blue, it's not looking good for Trump. He has to win 2/3 of PA/MI/WI to take it. Most likely scenario, unless both WI/MI flip blue early, is we're waiting on recounts and legal challenges in PA.\n\nIf both GA/NC go red, we're just waiting on any of PA/MI/WI to go red. If they do, it's an early night. If both WI/MI go blue, we're back to the PA scenario above.\n\nIn any scenario, if PA calls early due to overwhelming numbers out of every county except Philly, it's an early night.\n\nI think those are the only realistic scenarios. If we have something crazy like Trump taking VA or Harris taking FL, it throws everything out the window.",

And it may be close enough to require a recount. It comes up more often in lower ticket races, like the Minnesota Senate race with Al Franken and Norm Coleman. There is no guarantee that a winner is determined on election night, and it is unrealistic to demand that.",

People that call elections for a living, like Dave Wasserman, know the math at a county level and can confidently call the election when it hits a certain point. \n\nTo not know tonight/tomorrow morning, not only would it need to be incredibly close(closer than 2020), there would need to be some point of contention that can be challenged and possibly changed, like what happened with ballots in Florida in 2000(even though most people knew the challenge ultimately wouldn't change the results). The likelihood of that happening is incredibly small and there's no evidence to think it will happen this year.\n\nI'm fairly confident we will know the next president by 2am eastern time, if not before.",

         "He flipped Miami Dade County. That's huge",
         "It was trending this way in 2020 too iirc",
         "Donald Trump has seen a huge surge in support among Latino voters, according to\u00a0[a presidential election exit poll](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us-election/presidential-election-2024-harris-trump-latest-results/)\u00a0released on Tuesday night.\n\nThe former president is up 13 points among Latinos compared to his performance in 2020, when he lost the race to Joe Biden.\n\nThe boost comes despite a comedian at his Madison Square Garden rally last month\u00a0[comparing Puerto Rico to \u201cgarbage\u201d](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/10/28/trump-speaker-compares-puerto-rico-island-trash/)\u00a0floating in the ocean.\n\nLatino\u00a0[support for Trump](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/05/us-election-latest-news-polling-trump-kamala/)\u00a0is especially strong among men, where Trump has surged by 18 points to a majority of 54 per cent of the vote share. Kamala Harris attracted 44 per cent of the vote in that group, the poll showed.\n\nOverall, 53 per cent of Latinos said\u00a0[they would vote for Ms Harris](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/10/31/inside-pennsylvania-puerto-ricans-vote-kamala-harris/), compared with 45 per cent who said they would vote for Trump.\n\nThat is\u00a0[a significant boost for the Republican candidate](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/comment/2024/10/30/latino-voters-are-abandoning-kamala-harris-and-reshaping-us/)\u00a0on historic numbers, which generally show Latinos voting in droves for Democrats.\n\nThe estimated proportion of Latino voters in the 2024 election is 12 per cent, and the effect of their decision on the overall race will be determined by how many of them live in swing states that will decide the result.\n\nLatinos make up around 30 per cent of the electorate in two key battlegrounds, Arizona and Nevada. Trump lost both of the states to Mr Biden in 2020 but is looking to capture them this year after running a campaign heavily focused on border security.\n\nSeparate polls, taken before election day, show Latinos are most likely to have concerns about the economy and immigration \u2013 two issues on which Trump is generally more trusted than Ms Harris.\n\nTuesday night\u2019s exit poll gives a snapshot of the result of the presidential election among certain groups, according to 16,604 voters surveyed after casting their ballot.\n\nAlthough it cannot be used as a predictor of the winner, because it was taken before polls even closed, the data gives an indication of the likely demographic themes of the results.\n\n**Read more from The Telegraph:** [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/06/donald-trump-huge-surge-latino-voters-exit-poll/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/06/donald-trump-huge-surge-latino-voters-exit-poll/)",
         "Yes, but I think there's been a huge shift since.  Latino men moved like 30 points to Trump and women 10-15ish.",
         "Honestly, this really shouldn't be that surprising.\u00a0 Legal Latinos are the group that is being most directly harmed by Biden's open borders policies."
