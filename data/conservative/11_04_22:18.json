Here's what he wrote:\n\n>The great and powerful @elonmusk.\nIf it wasn't for him we'd be fucked.  He makes what I think is the most compelling case for Trump you'll hear, and I agree with him every step of the way.\nFor the record, yes, that's an endorsement of Trump.\nEnjoy the podcast",

         "Surprised he gave him the explicit endorsement. Didn't have to do that, especially after hosting him/JD/Elon, the endorsement was implied. Joe must feel really convicted to put his reputation on the line. Good for him.",

         "This is why he waited until the day before, hahaha",
         "Lmao yup",

         "It\u2019s honestly pretty crazy. I read a few years ago that Trump and Rogans relationship was tepid at best and now they\u2019re homies.",
         "The interview with Vance, and the latest one with Elon pushed him over from the silent supporter into just coming right out with it. I respect the hell out of him for doing it too. He really, REALLY seemed to like JD Vance. Like, he doesn't get on with some of his comedian friends the way he did with our future VP.",

         "Brandon!",
         "This endorsement is to grab people that weren't on planning on voting at all. The timing is fine.",
         "Never underestimate importance of just sitting down and talking to person. I think that would help a lot of things these days.",
         "Thank Uncle Dana for that. And Elon. And RFK.",

         "His stance on abortion has a long way to go.",
         "For sure \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc",
         "Except that\u2019s not really the case this election. A lot of us voted early. My county is very red and 50% of us voted early",
         "And that Austin has been getting progressively worse under the Dems",
         "It\u2019s not about swaying people, it\u2019s about getting them out to vote. There will be a non zero number of Rogan fans who will vote tomorrow because of this, every vote counts and we will get some because of this",
         "It's still less than half of all votes and Republicans doing well with early voting was unheard of before this year. I'm not saying it necessarily was strategic on Joe's part, but personally I think it's more impactful only hours before the majority go out and vote.",
         "75 million votes have been cast already. That's probably 50% of the vote. That's still another 75 million votes to be cast.\n\nThe timing of his endorsement is perfect. It would have gotten buried a week ago. Besides, the people voting early for Trump were going to vote for him anyway.",
         "Neither am I. He had Trump and Vance on which was great for the campaign"

In 2020, this lead went to the Democrats. However, this year Republicans lead once again with a margin of 41 per cent to 33 per cent.\n\nAcross all states, around 36 per cent of\u00a0[votes cast before election day\u00a0](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/03/us-presidential-election-2024-when-dates-candidates-voting/)have come from registered Republicans, compared to the Democrats\u2019 37.9 per cent.\n\nThis is the slimmest national gap on record between the two parties and a reflection of changing views on early voting which, historically, has favoured the Democrats.\n\nIn 2020, just 30.5 per cent of early votes were made by registered Republicans.\n\nAs many politicians were encouraging early voting due to the coronavirus pandemic, Donald Trump repeatedly raised\u00a0[suspicions about the practice.](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/10/31/polling-chaos-risk-undermining-us-election/)\n\nIn a series of tweets and conversations in September that year, he suggested that foreign countries could easily produce \u201ccounterfeit ballots\u201d.\n\nHe stated that the ballots were \u201cuncontrollable, totally open to election interference by foreign countries, and will lead to massive chaos and confusions\u201d.\n\nBut this year, the Republican party has encouraged members to adopt early voting. This has led to a surge in Republicans voting which, in turn, has pushed early votes to historic highs.\n\nAs of Monday evening, 78,185,854 early votes had been cast, equivalent to 49.4 per cent of the 2020 electoral turnout.\n\nThis is almost two-thirds higher than in 2016, when around one in three votes were cast before the election.\n\n**Read more from The Telegraph:** [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/04/republicans-take-lead-in-swing-state-early-voting/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/04/republicans-take-lead-in-swing-state-early-voting/)",

Meanwhile they call Trump and us Nazis... but can't back that up with anything real. They say because he had a dog and Hitler did too... I mean there is some serious logical problem and disconnect from reality on one side compared to the other.

The hate is off the charts from them they are the same people who in nazi germany would report their neighbors and family members to the state.

Kamala Harris has said the heart of the protestors (protesting for a genocide against Israelis) is in the right place.\n\nDonald Trump has said some things I fervently disagree with, but look at what he has done.

He instituted maximum pressure on Iran. \n\nOk buts that\u2019s all Israel and I\u2019m an American first and foremost. What has he done for American Jews? He has unequivocally denounced the pro Hamas protests. He extended Title VI civil rights protections to include Jews, those same protections are being used to sue concentration campuses today. He secured our border so Hamasnicks, like the one who shot my neighbor, don\u2019t come in. He has called out by name a policy for deporting supporters of FTOs who are not American citizens. On the anniversary of the Simchat Torah massacre he said a prayer at the Ohel in the company of a rabbi. \n\nTell ya what, I live in PA and haven\u2019t voted yet. Stack Kamala\u2019s record.

You want an example at the federal level? How about when Chuck Schumer warned Trump that the intelligence agencies had \"six ways from Sunday to get back at\" any president who dared to cross them. In other words, a bipartisan admission that these agencies have amassed so much power and have gone rogue and no longer answer to the elected head of the civilian federal executive as they are required to by law.

Also part of what's needed in this same conversation is overhauling the adoption process, make it easier and cheaper while maintaining safety vetting processes.
