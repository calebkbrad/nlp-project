I think anyone even mildly articulate and coachable from the D pool in congress would have won.  I think AOC would have beaten trump.  Trump deactivated as many Rs as he activates.\n\n2) the media wildly overplayed their hand.  Had they been more casual about pushing the lies, had they been more gracious towards Trump when he was right, he would\u2019ve had less fuel for his side.\n\n3) The VP pick by the dems was awful.  I think this hurt them more than anything else.\n\nOur ground game is still really weak and we needed a lot of people to come together to make this happen.  While we are likely winning all of congress, we still lost a lot of really winnable races.\n\nMonths ago many people said NJ was in play.  They were right.  NJ could have added 3 red reps and a red senator had the NJGOP not fucked around.  There were at least a dozen other races I can rattle of that should have been Ws for us but we made some bad choices.  \n\nLong story short we still have tons of rot internally we need to clean out.  We seriously need to build a bench, a marketing plan and execute.  Right now, we have neither.",

It\u2019s somewhat easier for boys to make a living while on Rumspringa, they have more needed skills such as carpentry, construction, farming, girls less so, housekeeping and similar, both due to limited education.

         "The most damning stat of the night was that Kamala performed worse than Biden in every single county in America, no hyperbole.\u00a0",
         "Well when you mail out hundreds of thousands of ballots to people who don't intend to vote, they are really easy to harvest and fill out.",
         "Still in their envelope waiting to be delivered from all the dead people and scammers.",
         "They couldn\u2019t cheat this year. Simple as that.",
         "Harris was just that bad of a candidate. It's not really that surprising. As of this comment, Harris barely has Clinton's amount of votes. That's how bad she is.\n\nTrump is going to win with around the same amount of votes, maybe even a little less, as 2020. He's most likely going to win the popular vote too. \n\nIf they had run someone even slightly likable and competent there's a decent chance we wouldn't be celebrating right now. I only say this because we don't need to get complacent. We need to start looking ahead to 2028 tomorrow, because we won't be able to rely on Trump next time and no other Republican is as charismatic as Trump.",
         "Did the urban areas turn out?  I don\u2019t find many excited in the urban areas. They may dislike Trump but it\u2019s hard to be excited about Harris and Democrats given the slow decline many of us have experienced under Democrat leadership.",
         "A bunch of states attorney generals fought back, not to mention lawsuits from conservative legal groups. There was some chicanery this election season from the federal government enrolling voters in states. \nYeah, it\u2019s easy to \u201charvests ballots when they are all set out automatically to whatever adduces they could find for people.",
         "Didn't stop them from voting last time",
         "And she lost the popular vote.",
         "That\u2019s a bingo.\n\nNobody believes the suitcases full of ballots that came in at 3am that propelled Biden into the WH were actually individually filled out by individuals, right?\n\n2020 was an aberration that occurred because of a 100 year pandemic event and a mass censorship campaign by big tech on behalf of the Democratic Party (they tried again this time but weren\u2019t as successful.. thanks Elon)",
         "I feel that the cheating was still there, but not as widespread as 2020 due to the lawsuits and oversight.",
         "If either party had just governed responsibly, Trump never would have been President in the first place",
         "Exactly. They stole the election. I hope Trump investigates and executes for treason all the people involved.",
         "And the Right being completely unprepared and getting caught with their pants down."
