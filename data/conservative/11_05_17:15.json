If a DC regular can't make PR out of it then it's stressful wasted time to them, but Trump is more comfortable going to North Korea than a lot of Dems are venturing outside the big city.",

Republicans getting a majority in Congress.\n2. Republican legislators actually caring enough about DC to fix its problems.\n\n2 is actually the biggest hurdle. Even though Congress is a custodian for DC, the people we elect don\u2019t give a damn about maintaining it, because it doesn\u2019t influence their chances of being elected in other parts of the country.\n\nAnd also they don\u2019t have to live there. If we forced Congress to live in DC, the problems would get fixed over night.\n\nIt\u2019s one of the things missing from the Constitution. When the Constitution was written, it wasn\u2019t as easy to travel long distances, so nobody envisioned this as a problem.",

And it got that way because of neglect from Congress, which is in charge of DC but doesn\u2019t have to live there.\n\nForce Congress to live in DC, and DC would become a livable city. That won\u2019t magically flip it red, but it would no longer be 90% Democrat.",
         "DC is mostly ghetto actually. The educated and government workers in DC proper is a minority \u2014 most actually live outside DC in Virginia or Maryland suburbs. There\u2019s only like a couple neighborhoods in DC that could be considered gentrified enough for middle class people to live there, and even those neighborhoods are kind of sketchy.\n\nSo it\u2019s more than being an East Coast city. Democrats have a monopoly on pretty much all ghettos in America, because sane people don\u2019t want to live there."

Being raised in backwater Algeria probably didn't help identify this anomaly for what it was prior to adolescence or beyond, so you've got this person living up to adulthood believing themselves to be a woman.

At the same time if we took a normal girl and started her on testosterone at the same time she was going through puberty the world would never let her compete by the time she reached adulthood especially if the testosterone was still being administered.

         "Feels good right? Thank you for sharing your story.\u00a0\n\n\nI had a similar experience what really solidified my belief that the right was the right choice quote unquote, was watching Trump speak live and then seeing the legacy media twist his words and downright outright lie about what was said.\u00a0\n\n\nI could never vote for the side that actively pushes propaganda.\u00a0",
         "Thank you!",
         "Welcome to the crew.\n\nJust so we're clear, there's more to being a conservative than not wanting wars.   1A and 2A are critical.  But also less government.  Less spending (which means less social programs).  Secure border.   And other things.\n\nWars will happen, no matter who is in office.  But you're right, with a Cheney in office (or supporting an office), wars may be more likely.",

Towns that coddle criminals get more criminals and they get bolder criminals, locals prepare for looting events the way they'd prepare for a big incoming storm.\n\nEver hear about the time cowboy town with tough cops and tough civilians got destroyed by rent-a-rioters? Me either.",
