         "I think the big thing going for Trump's popular vote results this election was his massive overperformance in blue states. Those states were not crushing defeats, they were relatively close. Either republicans in those states were motivated to actually go vote, or some dems crossed over. Either way, Trump killed it with his campaign, so many iconic moments.",
         "I'm honestly very shocked Trump won the popular vote.  And if you look at how he did it, it's crazy.  \n\nHe lost New Jersey by less than 5 points.  Biden won New Jersey by 16 and Hillary won it by 13.  Obama won it by 16 and 18.  Trump barely lost it.  That's pretty shocking.\n\nHillary won California by 30 points.  Kamala only won it by 17.\n\nThat's the big difference in the popular vote in this election - democrats usually run up the score in the deep blue states leading to a big popular vote advantage.  But either a lot of democrats stayed home or they crossed over and voted for Trump.",
         "I saw at least a couple dozen comments leading up to the election saying \" I'll eat my own shit if Trump wins the popular vote there's no way that happens.\"\n\n\nWonder if those NPCs made good on their offer.\u00a0",

California obviously doesn't GAF because their state is called for the Dem every time immediately.",
         "Illinois, though still to the Democrats, had a major swing of votes to Trump. That's what these people don't get.

         "Look it up, but the shortest version is..\n\n* In the USA the people do not vote for president directly. Only states vote for the president, your state gets a number of votes based on the population\n\n* We vote only to direct our own state how to vote\n\n* This goes back to the original colonies to make sure that Philadelphia and New York cities didn't just pick the president very election. This is exactly what would happen today except sub Las Angeles for Phily. \n\n* The popular vote means nothing in the USA. It isn't considered at all - EXCEPT - for morons that think the 240 year old system is unfair because people are represented all over the country instead of just in a couple cities.\n\n* Some morons in blue states have decided to change their states laws to ignore the electoral college system and instead just dump their votes into the winner of the popular vote (with caveats). The issue is, they honestly didn't imagine Republicans winning the popular vote again for some reason. Like just the shortest sighted people on the planet",
         "To break it down, each vote cast by every person regardless of state or location counts toward the popular vote. The framers of the Constitution didn't want the country run by the majority and since the original idea of the US was very federalist they set in place something called the Electoral College. Essentially each state votes for the president. So every state individually counts up the votes for the president cast in that state and they award \"their\" electors to whatever candidate wins. Each state had a certain number of electors based on the population of the state. A candidate has to get to 270 electoral votes to win the presidency. \n\nSo this only becomes an issue like in 2016 when Trump won the first time thanks to essentially 70,000  total votes in 3 states that gave him enough electoral votes to win the presidency but he lost the popular vote by around 3 million votes. So we had to spend 4 years hearing about how the \"EC\" needed to be torn down and that he wasn't legitimately picked because he didn't actually get the most votes. \n\nSorry for being so long.",
         "Popular vote is just the raw numbers from the population, just a total count of every vote cast. \n\nElectoral vote is a little more complicated, but basically every state gets a certain number of electoral votes based on population. Whatever candidate wins the majority of the popular vote in any given state will win all the electoral votes in that state. So even if 49.9% of voters choose the losing candidate, that candidate will not receive any electoral votes from that state.",
         "Haha oh yeah I know, it was just funny to read that way lol\n\nI agree though, it's great! And it's funny cause he's really fascinated with how much the world has advanced in some ways. Like him still calling things \"ratings\" for podcasts as if they're still TV shows, starlink, the rocket, et cetera. And I was surprised in how in touch he was with even things like energy, where I didn't even know about the whales being affected by windmills.\n\nYeah I think those podcasts really did him a big favor, everyone got to see how despite being a billionaire he's still finds the new things in life exciting"

But they aren't democrats they vote R. The dem narrative before today was all the republicans were voting for Kamala. If dems need to flip house races over weeks of vote finding then they'll change the narrative to fit that. Stop falling for it.\n\nBtw does \"your mom\" know that the democrat senator would have also voted to certify 2020? The time for those issues is the primary. Such a vote only hurts Trump and helps democrats at this point and the idea that a significant percent of Trump supporters want that is just as absurd as their previous narrative that tons of republicans were going to vote for Kamala.",

So we're not talking about the number of such people but the disparity between them. The numbers would in no way be so large to offset such a massive Trump landslide. New York is more red than Ohio and Iowa are blue and you're telling me the house is a tossup and dems may eke out a win? That is not believable."

Some doctors say hospital attorneys have intervened to delay care out of fear of legal repercussions from the bans.\n\nIn Arizona, all deaths during pregnancy are reviewed by a group of experts called the Maternal Mortality Review Committee (MMRC). The committee determines if the death was preventable and if patient care played a role.\n\nI think it's a dangerous slippery slope when the government inserts themselves into our medical care.\n\nOur women aren't getting the best possible care because doctors are cautious and withholding care for fear of being sued. In 2022, the maternal mortality rate in the United States was 22.3 deaths per 100,000 live births. This is higher than the rate in most other high-income countries. The U.S. and Canada have the lowest supply of midwives and obgyns. The US has ranked 55th in maternal mortality.

Two out of three maternal deaths in the U.S. occur during the postpartum period, up to 42 days after birth. Most families rely on dual income and cannot afford to have one parent out of work healing and taking care of a newborn. We should be advocating for this!\n\nOur sex education is abysmal in this country. We have to educate our youth to make informed decisions! They need to have knowledge of all different forms of contraception!\n\nWE HAVE TO PROTECT CHILDREN IN OUR FOSTER CARE SYSTEM! The horror stories that I've heard! And these children aren't set up to succeed in life. 25% won\u2019t graduate high school, 50% will develop a substance abuse dependence, 70% of young women will become pregnant before age 21, and only 3% of kids who age out will earn a college degree.\n\nBirth control isn't covered by most insurance providers. We have to make contraceptive options more accessible and affordable so that abortion isn't even a necessity. \n\nWe have to address these other major problems before even thinking about limiting access to abortion.",

One side sees it as the killing of a human, the other sees it as something similar to the removal of a tumor.  It\u2019s fantastic for a political hot button issue to get voters out there and realistically the only way I see a blanket compromise is, it\u2019s only available if - the baby wouldn\u2019t survive on its own after birth, or the mothers life is in jeopardy by carrying the baby to term, or in cases of rape, incest etc.  that\u2019s it. No \u201cwell I really like my career\u201d convenience type stuff.  \n\nAnd even that which I think is the middlest of middle grounds would still get rejected by both sides anyway. BUT it\u2019s been tossed back to the states.  Your friend, in the unlikely chance that she ever wants one has full and complete access to one for whatever reason she wants.  If someone in a state with stricter laws is concerned, they can either go to a less restrictive state or move if they want to keep their options open.  I do not want to see someone punished for traveling to get one. That\u2019s not something I support.  I live in NH and travel to Maine to buy cannabis legally so for me to say someone should be punished for going to another state to legally do something that\u2019s illegal in their home state would be hypocritical of me."

I mean, telling me that R mail ins were +200K over Dems didn\u2019t tell me shit about our outcome, right? /s I figured Trump to be +130K over Kamala, once Election Day came to pass (or, *and* pass, with these maroons!) +123K, last check yesterday evening.\n\nThere\u2019s no way they can screw us over this time\u2026the country is watching, if not more. Meantime, the process here is fucked, and we can thank Dems from 2016, onward. Remember this, Arizona\u2026we have two years to prepare a cleanup crew!",

That distrust is legitimate, because these states have potential avenues for election manipulation that simply do not exist in most states.\n\nElection day voting should be 100% in person with exceptions only for absentees who are literally unable to vote in person. If you're going to offer mail-in voting for non-absentees, it needs to be like Florida where the ballot must be postmarked by Friday before election day so the signature verification can be completed before election day and the number of mail-in ballots to be counted is set in stone before anyone knows what the national election results results look like.",

Florida is different since if you want to vote by mail, you have to drop it off to your county\u2019s election office, all ballots have to be returned by the Friday before the election, and they have to be finished counting them by 7pm the day before election. \n\nSo it\u2019s not incompetence, or ignorance.

Students are absent from their home county for months at a time so they're a quintessential example of a legitimate absentee voter. Also, you can't just vote anywhere in your state. You can only vote at your assigned polling place, and it's not unusual for people who travel for work to be away from their home county for a few weeks at a time.\n\nAlabama only allows absentee voting for people who fall under an approved list of reasons, and they seem pretty reasonable. I don't remember all of them, but they're things like being out of the county, being in the armed forces on active deployment, being physically incapacitated, being medically home-bound or caring for a family member who's home-bound, working for 10 or more hours during normal poll hours on election day, being in jail for a non-felony offense, etc.",

         "They have a much earlier deadline and count before election day.",
         "The point you're not getting is the *incompetence* of the Arizona votes led to them choosing something (mail-in voting) that has significant consequences. Long delays in the count/verification process, which puts the integrity of the results at risk.",
         "I can totally get that they want mail in balloting and they want a verification that they belong to someone. I may disagree with universal mail in voting, but I very much agree with requesting an absentee ballot and vigorously ensuring a signature verification a *very good thing*. No argument there.\n\nMy point of contention is that the process of getting the votes in and performing the verification should be finished by the time polls close on election day. If you're not starting that process until the polls close my mind says it's a point of delay in getting votes verified and counted that can cause concern for votes coming in late and/or under of circumstances and being counted all the same.  \n\nThe only thing I can imagine would lead to a legitimate reason why that process should be delayed would be if you are allowing for people to vote by mail, change their mind, vote in person to let that be the deciding/superseding vote, and then pull their ballot out of the mail in voting list. But that's gotta be a nightmare to try and pull off if that's the case.\n\nBut hey, I also get that off Arizona choose this, that's their bag, that's their prerogative. I just think it could be better performed and I question why they wouldn't want it to be finished night of, even if that means you have to get your vote in by the Friday/Saturday/Monday before election day.",
         "Oh I agree. I like the Florida way, mail ballots have to be received the Friday before the election, and counted the night before. \n\nBut a major difference is Arizona lets you drop it off to any ballot box, Florida is by mail or drop off to the county board. That makes an incredible difference. I\u2019m sure this has to do because AZ is way less dense than FL, so requiring voters to drive to their county board seat is probably a bit difficult, especially for older folks. But there has to be a fix for this"

         "As far as turnover, that was in part due to him trying to bring in people he liked but weren't qualified such as Amerosa or how ever you spell it. Now he understands how it works and has a much better, much more qualified group of people to put into those positions. He definitely made mistakes the first time that he learned from.\n\nFor me the big thing is the energy sector and border security. Those need to be day 1. The energy sector will start the economy back up and it will be booming in a year or less.\n\nThe democrats leaving our border open was straight up treason. The border needs to be closed, proper security measure in place then we need to find out who the hell is here. That's going to be a big job. Those people here that shouldn't be arn't exactly going to turn themselves in. What a mess the left created.\n\nI truly hope Trump informs the public constantly about this so they are reminded who's fault it is. 100% guarantee that if a terrorist attack happens from someone who got in under Biden, the left will still blame Trump and say it happened under his watch.",

Pence could not have won in 2024. Ignore the events of J6 as they don't happen in this theoretical timeline. Liberals hate Pence for being conservative, and Republicans likely still would have soured on him just due to having been the head of Trump's Covid task force. Covid policy was largely a state-level issue, but most voters don't think that deeply and Pence was the face of the Trump administration's covid response and it would have hurt him even more electorally than is boringness already does.\n\nLosing in 2020 ultimately led to the events that brought people like Tulsi and RFK Jr to our side. It let Trump ditch Pence for a charismatic and electable VP. It shined A LOT of light on how far left the Democratic Party has moved.

His track record for turning around failing organizations and making them industry leaders has no parallel. \n\nThe government needs reform more then anything for how it manages and acts on it's congressional mandates. There is far to much corruption and regulation strangling both parties ability to do things. Ballooning costs and the timelines to get things done are a symptom of this (and we should feel actual fucking shame when we look at how much China has been able to get done). To have someone with a track record of being able to clean house and keep things mostly running in the interim is an opportunity that feels like a once in a lifetime thing. \n\nThe fact that Trump and his team also have complete control of congress and a favorable court makes it feel less like an opportunity and more like providence. \n\nTruly it feels like a hand is guiding our history up to this point. The hand we have to play in the next 2 years is one we may never see again in our lifetime.",

But for now, inflation control, border security, crime, housing costs, etc. are what need to be tackled first.\n\nOne conservative point I DO hope they take on is gun rights. I\u2019m really hoping a few unconstitutional gun laws go before the SCOTUS in the next year or so, such \u201cassault weapon\u201d bans.

Now it's above $405 the last time I checked. Whether it's the child tax credit or fsa, something has to give because childcare absolutely wrecks the finances of the working class. Would also ease some of the pressures of abortion by bettering the economic feasibility of bringing kids into this world.\n\n>Allowing to move unused dcfsa to a 529 plan would be fantastic.

I may not agree with her on many things, but she's served her country and 100% has earned the chance.\n\nI expect the Dems to throw someone like Pritzker to the front of the line in 2028.

Just because a second time homebuyer may have equity in their first home to use toward the second home doesn\u2019t mean much when the housing market is out of control. Also that second time home buyer had to buy their first home by saving money, without any help from the government. These kinds of artificial injections do nothing but upset the workings of the economy, and come crashing down later. If people can\u2019t afford homes, fix the home prices.

But at the right time, he needs to be put forward and allowed to be the face of the conservative movement.  Maybe put in Lara Trump as his vice presidential candidate to appeal to women, as she will represent the Trump name and the wave that followed him personally.

It proceeded to brainwash half the country into believing that their fellow citizens were racist, fascist, and phobic nature haters. The media creating the crudest caricatures of ordinary Americans, and the vast majority of Democrats bought into them. \n\nThe psychopathy of social media, and the stupidity of mobs, enabled the witch hunt. \n\nThere have been some excellent books published recently on the topic, but a full accounting of the cruelty and madness of the last decade has not yet been written. -Michael Shellenberger",

The election isn't about the popular vote, so why would I  put resources into something that doesn't determine the outcome\". This cycle, we see Trump putting in time in NY doing things like renting out Madison Square Garden, building a voter base in a state that he absolutely would not win. That doesn't change the outcome of the election, but it builds a better narrative for him, and I think that's why we saw more things like the MSG rally.\n\nDemocrats have been complaining about the electoral college since 2004, the last time a Republican won the popular vote, but Trump absolutely showed that Republicans can win whatever game the Democrats want to play. We just have to stick to a principled and common sense platform.\n\nWinning the swing states really was goal number 1, but I think Vance (who will probably be the 2028 candidate) has been given a great blueprint on running a national election as opposed to 50 state elections",

That was the moment I realized he is a man touched by Destiny.\n\nLike Napoleon famously said:\u00a0*\"Destiny urges me to a goal of which I am ignorant. Until that goal is attained I am invulnerable, unassailable. When Destiny has accomplished her purpose in me, a fly may suffice to destroy me.\"*\n\nIt's impossible today to deny Trump is also touched by this force of nature. I'm still in awe of it. ",

Shout out Scott Presler, that man went above and beyond, not for himself but for ideals he felt best benefited the country. Selfless patriot and I wish the best for him. Would be really cool to see him advance and maybe get more involved with the Trump team if he so desires",
         "I would say Trump being shot unified the party, which was essential for him to do. Maybe that doesn't happen otherwise. So it's a big deal. But I don't think he wins on that alone.\n\nBut I think what won him the election was the alternative media blitz.\n\nGen Z broke big for Trump. \n\nTrump going on podcasts and doing events with Adin Ross, Theo Von, Bryson DeChambeau, Nelk boys, Bussin with the boys, Logan Paul, the Undertaker... And Joe freaking Rogan.... And so many others... This is what Gen Z watches, not SNL or the tonight show (which Kamala went on). These people are where they get news and entertainment from. And Trump gave them long format interviews which Gen Z really got to know Trump directly from the source.\n\nThat's what won him the election, imo.",
         "Someone made an amazing point. If Trump won in 2020, he would not have the house and Senate. It would have been 4 years of hoaxes.\n\nThis is literally the happy ending we all deserve!",

The fundamentals of life: costs around food and shelter\n\nObviously all of them were impactful in some way, I just don't know which one was the MOST impactful.\n\nHonestly, I'm leaning towards the first debate, because that was the moment I saw a LOT of Democratic voters suddenly say *\"wow, our candidate just cannot do this\"*. Frankly... that sucked the wind out of their sails, and I think a lot of would-be Democrat supporters stayed home because of it.",

TPUSA also delivered Wisconsin. Kirk appears to have delivered AZ and NV as well.\n\nCredit where it's due, too, DeSantis and Kemp delivered FL and GA with a nice bow on top. Not sure who was responsible for NC but thanks to them too.",
         "Every bit helps obviously so don't take this the wrong way but I'm waiting until 2026 and 2028 before I'm convinced Pressler actually made a difference. If he can prove himself then, I'll donate and maybe even volunteer myself to whatever cause he's leading.\n\nRight now, Trump's vote total will be around the same as 2020. It seems Trump and Trump alone is the reason for massive voter turnout. If we can replicate it in elections without Trump, then I'll be impressed.",

         "Best scrapbook ever.",
         "Don't forget the garbage truck",
         "Do not discount the importance of the Vance debate, either. Trump lost a lot of momentum in the way he handled the Harris debate, but then Vance gained it right back when he picked Walz apart. Vance showed that he isn't some \"weirdo\" hick from the mountains -- he is actually quite sharp and very well spoken. I have no doubts that this won over quite a few people who were dubious before.\n\nAdding to that was his Rogan interview, where he further demonstrated he is just an ordinary guy trying to make a difference. He is relatable and he is clean. He is exactly what the GOP needed to balance Trump's ego and baggage.",
         "And the mugshot",
         "add in an unlikable opponent who nobody voted for and couldn't name a single policy and you have the biggest republican win in modern history. (Not electoral college wise, but the popular vote alone which had been a struggle for republicans since Reagan)",

         "Since we got MI and WI too, we didn't need PA. Charlie Kirk was up in MI, though, so it was a team effort. I'm not sure if as strong an effort was made in WI, and, right now, it looks like PA and MI voted to the right of WI. That is a change from 2016 and 2020, when WI was the rightest of the three. So that could be a sign that the efforts in MI and PA paid dividends.",
         "He went by county by county in PA and flipped the voter registrations from Dem to GOP by registering low propensity voters. \n\nFor example, Presler worked to flip the voter registrations in Bucks County and Trump ended up flipping the county from blue to red in the general yesterday.",
         "He's spent almost every day of the last 4 years in Pennsylvania registering as many people to vote for Republicans/Trump as possible",
         "As well as the two other comments state of him registering voters he\u2019s also just a good human being. He\u2019s done a lot for communities, in Baltimore for example he organized a massive clean up on the city streets",
         "> Not sure who was responsible for NC but thanks to them too.\n\nThat was me :)\n\nJoke's aside, NC is sliding toward being a fully red state.  Like Florida, a lot of conservatives moved here during covid for less restrictions.\n\nWe've had shit luck with terrible GOP governor options the past few elections, but the state legislature is majority GOP and up till one seat flipped this last time it was a GOP supermajority.",
         "I hear what you\u2019re saying but the sheer number of new registered republican voters in the state of PA proves he made a significant difference. The numbers of registered voters in multiple PA counties flipped from democrats majority to republican majority. Trump would\u2019ve won without PA, knowing that now, but not even from a finite tangible numbers aspect, the man has worked incredibly hard to shape the identity and personality of what a republican/conservative voter actually looks like and who they are. The media has painted us as racist, misogynistic, sexist etc etc and every interaction I\u2019ve seen regarding Scott Presler is how nice and kind he is which provides an immeasurable impact to the perception of a candidate and their party",

         "Do you have a link to the smash ultimate one?\u00a0",
         "The silver lining to suffering for 4 years is that we now have a much stronger and more unified GOP. The world now knows who Vance is, and if things go well these next 4 years, I think he has a great chance in 2028.\n\nThere's also a golden opportunity now permanently repair some of the damage the Dems did and put safeguards in place to keep them from breaking it again. Mass deportations must happen, and we also must have federally-mandated voter ID requirements. Just by virtue of requiring ID to vote, it will cut down on illegal immigration because the Dems will no longer have as much of an incentive to allow wide open borders.\n\nThere also needs to be stringent requirements placed on who is eligible to utilize mail-in ballots. It should *only* be an option for those who can prove they are physically handicapped (i.e. you have handicapped vehicle registration), those over 65, and those who are deployed as active duty, civilians, or contractors supporting the military.\n\nHell, while at it, pass a 15 week national abortion law. Anything goes until 15 weeks, and after that you must have a medically justifiable reason (such as safety of the mother or grave anomalies in the fetus) to terminate. This is as fair of a compromise as you can get and I think it will placate the majority of people. Doing this will serve two purposes: 1) It will take away a major talking point the Dems use every single election cycle. 2) It prevents Dems from later passing a law allowing something much more insidious, such as third trimester abortions.",

He went viral for this video:\n\nhttps://fb.watch/vHZIK4mzt5/\n\nHe was cleaning up the streets of San Francisco, when some Karen decided to confront him.  He went on a tirade, and then vowed to bring Trump back into office.  He moved to a swing state, PA, and made it his mission to swing that state back to Red.  He and his PAC is pretty much responsible for swinging that state Red.\n\nTrump needs to give him some award or medal.",

         "It really is undeniable that that was a major push for gen z voters. All we do is shitpost and he is the shitpost king. You could feel the momentum he had ever since the mugshot.

Putting something like that in place would cause more backlash and infighting than it would be worth.

These people forget that, while Trump might mention God from time to time, Trump has never come across as an overly religious person in the sense the religion controls his day to day life. \n\nMost people who oppose abortion enough to support a full ban.. feel that way because of their religious beliefs. That just doesn't track for Trump.\n\nThey also forget that plenty of conservatives believe in the right to choose, but we also believe it is a states issue. I don't think Trump would have support even from some of his own party going for a full abortion ban.",

It was the left. \n\nBoth sides need to realize that, to millions of average Americans, the issue just isn\u2019t that important. They haven\u2019t had and don\u2019t plan to have abortions, and even if they believe in the right to choose, it\u2019s not strong enough to supersede policies that affect their day to day. \n\nAlso. The left doesn\u2019t realize that many Americans feel that leaving it to the states IS still the right to choose.

         "Can we finally drop the word \"democracy\" from the conversation now? It's a constitutional republic and always has been. The term \"democracy\" is used (edit: in contrast to a republic) in the Federalist Papers (no. 14):\n\n>The error which limits republican government to a narrow district has been unfolded and refuted in preceding papers. I remark here only that it seems to owe its rise and prevalence chiefly to the confounding of a republic with a democracy, applying to the former reasonings drawn from the nature of the latter. The true distinction between these forms was also adverted to on a former occasion. It is, that in a democracy, the people meet and exercise the government in person; in a republic, they assemble and administer it by their representatives and agents. A democracy, consequently, will be confined to a small spot. A republic may be extended over a large region.\n\nThe author argues that a common misconception limits republican government to small areas, stemming from confusion between a republic and a democracy. In a democracy, the people govern directly, so it is practical only in small regions. In contrast, a republic operates through representatives, allowing it to govern larger territories. This distinction, previously discussed, highlights how a republic can succeed over a vast area where a direct democracy could not.\n\nThe more you know.",

Much of the working class and minorities found out in the Obama years that the agitation and promises were just tools to garner their vote. Biden/Harris put the nails in the Dem coffin by going even further left, and being even more blatant in their tactics. They did the same thing leftists do when I debate them in forums. They just double down on their dishonest narrative, and then buy support from \"celebrities\" who are nothing more than paid actors. \n\nI'm glad the wiles of the left are being exposed, and all the creepy people who come out of the woodwork to endorse for dollars are being exposed along with them.",

Other than Mark Cuban, did Kamala have a single celebrity endorser actually go on the campaign trail for her?\n\nThen you look at the celebs that endorsed Donald Trump. Many of them are long time outspoken conservatives that suffered serious harm to their careers when they became politically active (i.e. Mel Gibson). Most of their endorsements isn't just one statement, but actively campaigning on behalf of Trump. Be it James Woods on X constantly posting about Trump and politics, or Musk holding town halls in Pennsylvania. The endorsers that do make just one rally appearance will usually go up there and wing it. If they have a prepared statement to give, it'll be book ended by crowd work and they seem like they're genuinely having fun.\n\nSo no, I don't think the problem is that it's a celebrity.

         "They've told me a bunch of times.\n\n\"Because she wants abortion.\"\n\nThat's literally it besides the generic promises every politician offers like \"they care about families and workers\" shit that I don't think even they buy.",
         "They don\u2019t care who ran. It\u2019s all based in TDS fueled by social media.",
         "They did. It's just that they think skin color, gender, and not being the other guy are qualifications.",
         "I\u2019m just about ready to start doing exactly that.  \ud83d\ude02",
         "White liberals love saying that to minority voters. Liberals seem to think they own these folks. They are incredibly racist people. Then the message to white men is to disregard their \"best interests\" and vote on behalf of the women in their lives. It turns out that only some people get to vote their interests. \n\nI'll keep voting for candidates that can deliver a secure borders, a strong economy, and low energy prices. These interests are universal.",
         "I like that argument. The way I tend to phrase it is\u2026 you can vote for whatever you want. You\u2019re an American and can vote for anyone for any reason, you owe no one an explanation.\u00a0",

         "You\u2019re 100% correct. I found that out quickly on the prolife sub when asked why I held my stance.  Every time I laid it out in the most simplest way I could think of and just kept getting \u201cOk but what if\u201d and just eventually gave up. \n\nLike you said, just talking in circles and none sense.",
         "After all Trumps been through you have to ask what is his motivation to keep going? It\u2019s either whatever nefarious reason the left presents, or he truly does want his country to be number 1. I think it\u2019s the latter. We get that commitment from him and the universe balances it out by making him say something dumb every few weeks.",
         "The amount of times I was called sexist and racist in r/politics yesterday is hilarious. I am brown woman and a naturalized citizen from Middle East \ud83d\ude02",
         ">Ignore **AND BLOCK**",
         "Oh I like that one! But he gets called an anti-vaxer so there\u2019s that. lol.",
         "There's nothing stopping you lol",
         "I just had that discussion of r/politics.\n\nI made the point that, if Candace Owens, a black woman, was running for president with the same policies and platform as Trump, I'm certain she would have still won against Harris.\n\nReally takes the wind out of their sales when they can't claim it's about sex or race.",
         "It's funny. Sunny Hostin was talking about how America rejected Kamala even though she's a mixed race woman and has a Jewish husband.\n\nBitch, his daughter and son-in-law are Jewish. His vice president married an Indian woman and they have a beautiful family with mixed race kids. Race has nothing to do with this guy's agenda.",
         "Exactly. I had a discussion with my sister\u2019s very liberal friend while they were both staying at my house last year. Topic of Kamala came up and friend said she really likes her. I asked what she liked about her. Answer was \u201cI like what she represents\u201d. That was it. Nothing specific. She couldn\u2019t speak to anything specific at all because in all honesty there is nothing there.",
         "Oh God MORE WINNING???? WHAAAAAAT????",
         "! remind me in 15 years when I'm probably getting tired of winning. Oh hell make it 30.",
         "Right on",
         "It makes me absolutely furious that the past 10-20 years have ended up creating these monsters who see everyone they disagree with as sexist, racist, bigoted, etc. \n\nYou never heard those words when I was a child. Now they're everywhere.",
         "It's actually kinda what makes me think we're not ready for a president who isn't a white hetero man. During the Obama administration any criticism was dismissed as racism. Hillary's loss was blamed on sexism. Now Harris lost and they're blaming sexism and racism. If we're not allowed to judge certain groups of people on their merit they shouldn't be in charge.",
         "This is true.  But the odd thing is it's fluid.  If Vance follows Trump's term as the next Republican candidate, it'll become VDS.  A year ago, they wouldn't have even known his name.  Whoever it is next, watch and see.  These leftists are part of a cult.",
         "In their own way, yeah. You need only look at all the posts about how they are so intelligent and open minded, while Trump supporters are close-minded and ignorant. They think they are being rational, sensible people who are 'accepting of differences' and so on.",
         "You can't afford it.",
         "My actual expectation for that would be the Archer subtitles in that one episode: \\[LOUD, FULL-HEARTED BITCHING\\]",
         "Honestly, I'd love if he chose on his own not to use social media much these next 4 years, just to see if they can keep up the Trump hate all 4 years when he's quiet. I bet they'd lose momentum. \n\nA large part of why this election ended up the way it did is because Trump has been FAR quieter than years past.\n\nEven CNN all day today has been so much more accepting and moderate than I expected. It doesn't appear they're ramping up for anti-Trump 24/7 rhetoric at this point, and I wonder if he remains calm and doesn't say anything too crazy, the hatred for him dies down some.",
         "I mean, you are American, idk why everyone keeps resorting to bs identity stuff. I am also a naturalized citizen :)",
         "If you are naturalized then you are just an American citizen. I\u2019m happy you decided to come here and to become a citizen, welcome :) Immigration is crucial to the growth of the US.\n\nFrom my personal experience, my interactions with people who have immigrated here legally have been extremely positive. My doctor is from Scotland and a specialist I see, she is from Pakistan. They are both very good doctors. However, as soon as I state that I\u2019m against illegal immigration and how it\u2019s not only damaging to the lower wage working citizens across the country, but also unfair to those who come here using the legal process, I get yelled at for being racist and hating immigrants. It blows my mind.",
         "But Mr president I can\u2019t take anymore winning\u2026. \n\n\u201cTOO BAD!!!\u201d",
         "You can blame Obama for that. He started this crap. I too remember a time before all this division. This is all directly out of the socialists Alinsky playbook. Divide us up, inject hatred and distrust so that we can\u2019t have inter-group conversations and discover we have far more in common and the true \u201cenemies\u201d are the elites.  There are way more of us than there are of them and they know it.",
         "Sadly, you\u2019re right. The leftist cult sees anyone with an (R) as an enemy of their agenda.",
         "CNN is at this very minute talking about \"uneducated\" people voting red. They're clinging onto that talking point for dear life.",
         "I\u2019d like to think so but I doubt that lasts more than a week.",
         "Exactly. My cousin in law\u2019s neighbors in Jersey asked me if I consider myself Turkish or American and without skipping a beat I answered \u201cI am an American\u201d. They were really shocked and all lost a bet against the cousin apparently.\u00a0\n\nI moved here at 16 and am now in my 40s. I grew up here, spent my life here and all I know is USA. \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\u00a0\n\nLove this country!\u00a0",
         "Because it\u2019s all they have. Don\u2019t know how to make a point without coming from a specific identity and narrative",
         "It's hilarious. As if not having a college degrees makes people 'uneducated', when everyone for the last year has seen exactly what these colleges are teaching kids, and it sure as hell isn't how to think critically.",
         "I have a degree in philosophy.  I also have a tech degree for industrial maintenance.  I voted red.  I must be uneducated.",
         "I think that\u2019s one of the major differences between legal and illegal immigrants. I\u2019ve consistently seen legal immigrants say they consider themselves American but illegal immigrants who have been here for a decade still consider themselves as being whatever country they\u2019re from and they\u2019ll wave that flag exclusively, but never the American flag. This isn\u2019t true in every single case, obviously, but overall it\u2019s been what I\u2019ve seen. It seems like the hard work needed to become a legal citizen really drives home the fact that they are now American just like the rest of the US citizens.",
         "You\u2019re probably successful too, because you integrated into the culture and took advantage of what was available rather than using all your effort to make the place you came more like the place you left. \nSeems to be a theme among all immigrants that are successful in the U.S.: they don\u2019t try to bring their home country to their new country.",
         "It definitely varies. My husband\u2019s family came here legally when my husband was a toddler, but my MIL still refers to Peru as \u201cher country.\u201d Never made sense to me honestly, since she and my FIL chose to leave Peru and start a new life here, and she\u2019s been living in the USA for over half her life at this point. She\u2019s even a naturalized US citizen now. I\u2019ve never heard her talk about the US with the same pride she takes in talking about Peru.",
         "Yeah that\u2019s weird. Eastern European immigrants seem to default to calling their ancestral homeland \u201cthe old country\u201d, which seems to indicate an acknowledgment, but not allegiance."

She was still tossed into the *very* deep end. Literally thrown to the wolves.\n\nNo, I don\u2019t sympathize. Yes, grudgingly\u2026 I *respect*.\n\nSHE walked straight at him with her hand extended at the debate.\n\nSHE went toe to toe with him at the debate. Opinions on her performance don\u2019t matter - she did it far better than her predecessor.\n\nSHE initiated the cordials at the 9/11 Memorial.\n\nSHE called to congratulate him.\n\nFor those things alone, if nothing else, she has my respect.\n\nYes, as a candidate & general politician, she could have done better with decorum.\n\n\u2026but she has a far better grasp of that than he ever will. Stark truth. That doesn\u2019t mean she warrants support. Simply means she does deserve at least some modicum of respect.\n\nShe rose above ALL of her counterparts and acknowledged her opponent.

No. Would most candidates in her position have lost if they suddenly got implanted into a race without getting voted in after being gaslit about the president's condition for years? Absolutely.\n\nI'm glad it was a decisive victory because any ambiguity over who won would've had the democratic party fighting for \"democracy\" for a candidate their voters never nominated, and this was already enough of a circus.\n\nMy hope is dems start getting rightfully pissed at the democratic party for pulling moves like these, leadership gets uprooted and they actually start doing what they can to attract politicians looking to actually help the American people and small businesses and cut out the rest of the noise, and if they do that and start winning elections, I hope the Republican party similarly gets overhauled so we can maybe some day in my lifetime have presidential candidates that actually feel like the most fit and qualified for the most powerful position in the world.\n\nThat or we implement RCV and other better parties get made and uproot the entire system as it sits today.",

It doesn't help that she was even polling lower than Biden during Biden's win\n\nApart from shooting themselves in the foot like they did with Hillary, she never actually managed to bring people to her.
