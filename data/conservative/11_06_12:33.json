Transparency in elections is important if you actually believe in democracy, and they did everything to prevent transparency after 2020 which tells you all you need to know. People who think they are innocent do not act that way.\n\nThey ignored sworn testimony under penalty of perjury and didn't even bother to look into it. The media declared immediately with nothing but blind assertions and argument from authority that it was \"debunked\" and \"baseless\". \"We 'investigated' ourselves and found we did nothing wrong\".\n\nWhat makes it even worse for elections is that we don't have access to a lot of info that only the government does and if they prevent access to it we can't verify claims from poll workers and validate integrity of the process. I personally still believe the main way they cheated in 2020 was with mail ballots and that if they properly ignored those with mismatched signatures as required by law the democrats would have easily lost. It's why to this day not a single state allowed us to check signatures after the one 100 ballot random sample the Arizona court ordered showed between 5% and 11% didn't match. The judge ruled that because the ballot still had personal info that matched the voter on it like their phone number that was enough... even though they didn't follow up to actually see if that person really voted, not to mention that's not the law. So yeah, 2020 was a joke and their response to our concerns about it is what should have given it away to anyone who was on the fence.",

You pretend to be the winner, reduce the incentives for your side to actually be better (since you'll still pick them anyway), meanwhile you force the other side to get stronger and work harder to even have a chance to compete with you. The result is in real terms you prop up the other side and hurt your own.",

A comment or post has its destiny set within the first few minutes.  If you get to -5 on a comment quickly, chances are folks will just follow suit and hit you with a drive-by downvote without ever engaging just because.  Human nature, not really a left or right thing.  Ditto for a comment that gets to +10 pretty quickly.  Folks will just hit that up arrow to be part of the crowd.  With a post, its more like the first hour.  But if you make a somewhat decent, non-political post in a benign sub, you can sort of watch this happen.  If you catch a little fire within the first hour, your post will end up at a couple hundred upvotes and near the top of whatever sub.  But if it doesn't move in that first hour, its a dead post.  The mechanics of the website mean you can't really build a slow groundswell. \n\nAll that means its quite easy to astroturf here.  You don't actually need massive bot armies.  You need a small handful of coordinated accounts to push certain posts and comments up, and others down.  If you post a Pro-Kamala article on a big sub, and get +100 on that post in the first few minutes, you don't have to do anything else.  The natural function of reddit and people will do the work for you.  For opposing articles, its even easier! If you see a post you don't like pop up, and you get -10 in the first couple minutes, that post is dead. Buried in New with a net negative score is doom for a post.  This phenomenon is not limited to politics or divisive topics.  It happens all the time in any sub.  Particularly in sports subs, if you're looking you can see two comments making nearly identical points, one at like +100 and one at -75.  Its really just related to what the first 4 or 5 voters do.  After that momentum takes care of the rest.  All that to say, if you have just 100 coordinated accounts, you can do serious damage.  Instagram's algorithm means you need a higher volume of coordinated accounts to accomplish your goal.",

I witnessed so many parroted, outright lies that I knew to be factually incorrect, that I was driven to basically *totally* ignoring any Trump news from a HUGE portion of the media.  I really try to stay centrist in media consumption as well & truly value hearing both sides (girlfriend was a Harris voter even).\n\nI truly think that if they'd have backed the crazy off '**11+!!**' just a hair, and maybe stuck to a mild 6 or 7...  it would have gone over a LOT better with fence sitters and... well... normal sane people lol.",
