The term \"democracy\" is used (edit: in contrast to a republic) in the Federalist Papers (no. 14):\n\n>The error which limits republican government to a narrow district has been unfolded and refuted in preceding papers. I remark here only that it seems to owe its rise and prevalence chiefly to the confounding of a republic with a democracy, applying to the former reasonings drawn from the nature of the latter. The true distinction between these forms was also adverted to on a former occasion. It is, that in a democracy, the people meet and exercise the government in person; in a republic, they assemble and administer it by their representatives and agents. A democracy, consequently, will be confined to a small spot. A republic may be extended over a large region.\n\nThe author argues that a common misconception limits republican government to small areas, stemming from confusion between a republic and a democracy. In a democracy, the people govern directly, so it is practical only in small regions. In contrast, a republic operates through representatives, allowing it to govern larger territories. This distinction, previously discussed, highlights how a republic can succeed over a vast area where a direct democracy could not.\n\nThe more you know.",

Both sides think they are working to save America, and both sides are calling each other a threat. Like it's beyond a policy debate and very tribal. That's what it seems like. I imagine most people just want to not worry about surviving and want better for their kids. I'd like to think that if someone saw a stranger in need of help, they wouldn't first ask who they voted for before offering help.\n\nMaybe the problem is your election cycles are too long so the parties and the media need to make everything an extreme threat or over hype everything to keep things interesting.

What is it you think you are going to suffer? We had him as president before. Did he forget to Handmaids Tale us then? It was always kinda strange to me how people are so convinced all these terrible things will happen when we literally had him as president before and none of that happened. \n\nDepending on your views on abortion, I can see how people would feel his Supreme Court decisions led to catastrophic results, but I\u2019m a person who thinks the issue belongs at the state level so that didn\u2019t have me hand-wringing. Truly tho, I am really sorry you are worried. I hate this political climate and I just want some normalcy again, which is why I really wished Trump wouldn\u2019t run.

I\u2019m aware that the total value of imports is in the ball park of how much revenue is made from income tax. But let\u2019s say there\u2019s a flat 10% tariff on all goods, that\u2019s 10% of the previous revenue. And that is also not taking into account how much imports would go down as people can\u2019t afford to buy as much."

I admit I was skeptical at first but I'm now convinced we have to run Don Jr to keep up this enthusiasm because no Republican gets voters excited like a Trump does.",
         "I believe this as well. Some time after Trump was elected in 2016, he addressed this. He said something along the lines of \"Of course I didn't win the popular vote. The election isn't about the popular vote, so why would I  put resources into something that doesn't determine the outcome\". This cycle, we see Trump putting in time in NY doing things like renting out Madison Square Garden, building a voter base in a state that he absolutely would not win. That doesn't change the outcome of the election, but it builds a better narrative for him, and I think that's why we saw more things like the MSG rally.\n\nDemocrats have been complaining about the electoral college since 2004, the last time a Republican won the popular vote, but Trump absolutely showed that Republicans can win whatever game the Democrats want to play. We just have to stick to a principled and common sense platform.\n\nWinning the swing states really was goal number 1, but I think Vance (who will probably be the 2028 candidate) has been given a great blueprint on running a national election as opposed to 50 state elections",

Sure, Republican opinions of him wouldn't have soured because there would be no J6 in this timeline.

I still 100% believe there was significant fraud in 2020. And there was a reduction in that this time because the Republicans were much more prepared for it with poll watchers, legal teams, etc.\n\nWhat the ratio of #1 and #2 above is? I'm not sure.

I think if we never had Trump and they could slow walk it it would have. But Trump forced them to dial it up to 11 too fast the only question is did they have enough control over public opinion to make that work yet. They were very close but we just found out the answer to that was a resounding no. I do hope the party reforms for the better, but they tend to just double down on evil failed and wrong so I won't hold my breath.

         "The biggest tell about the 2020 election was that you were not allowed to question it and they ignored our concerns (to the point they relentlessly mocked us). If they were innocent and there was truly nothing to see then they would have wanted to talk about it because 1) it would have been a win for them to debunk Trump on the merits to his face in front of his supporters and 2) it would have reduced tensions in the country for people to feel their concerns were taken seriously instead of dismissed without any real investigation, media coverage, public debate, or trial on the merits. Transparency in elections is important if you actually believe in democracy, and they did everything to prevent transparency after 2020 which tells you all you need to know. People who think they are innocent do not act that way.\n\nThey ignored sworn testimony under penalty of perjury and didn't even bother to look into it. The media declared immediately with nothing but blind assertions and argument from authority that it was \"debunked\" and \"baseless\". \"We 'investigated' ourselves and found we did nothing wrong\".\n\nWhat makes it even worse for elections is that we don't have access to a lot of info that only the government does and if they prevent access to it we can't verify claims from poll workers and validate integrity of the process. I personally still believe the main way they cheated in 2020 was with mail ballots and that if they properly ignored those with mismatched signatures as required by law the democrats would have easily lost. It's why to this day not a single state allowed us to check signatures after the one 100 ballot random sample the Arizona court ordered showed between 5% and 11% didn't match. The judge ruled that because the ballot still had personal info that matched the voter on it like their phone number that was enough... even though they didn't follow up to actually see if that person really voted, not to mention that's not the law.

Unusable. Untouchable.\n\nBesides that, I remain convinced that the rising Democrats knew perfectly well that Trump was going to win back in July. He was miles ahead, there was only a hundred days to go, and they all have 2028 aspirations. No one wants a loss on their record, it\u2019s much easier to run as the challenger after four years of Trump. Why do you think that Newsom and Whitmer were among the first to take themselves out of consideration for VP?",

We barely agreed on a speaker of the House and when we finally did we ended up picking a guy that espouses BLM talking points.\n\nLike I said, I think Trump can do some real good over these four years. Sweeping changes is not what electing Trump was about though. You're only setting yourself up for disappointment and, more importantly, it's setting MAGA up for failure in the future if people go into this expecting Trump to fix everything in four short years. \n\nManaging expectations and letting voters know why Trump may not be able to accomplish everything he talked about makes it much less likely they turn on us when '26 and '28 roll around."

The penalties for the conviction range from four years in prison to house arrest or a fine.\n\nHowever, the presiding judge, Juan Merchan, is considering the possibility of dismissing the case and has given himself a deadline of Nov 12 to make a decision.\n\nIf Mr Merchan were to press ahead with the case, Trump\u2019s lawyers have indicated they would seek a delay.\n\nSentencing a president-elect ahead of Inauguration Day would be unprecedented in US history, and legal experts believe a delay would be swiftly granted pending an appeal.\n\nMeanwhile, officials at the US Department of Justice (DoJ) spent Wednesday reviewing how to wind down the two federal cases against Trump.\n\nThey have been spearheaded by Jack Smith, the independent special counsel who has been doggedly pursuing Trump through the courts for the last two years.\n\nSources within the DoJ said the cases would be shuttered because of the department\u2019s long-standing policy against prosecuting a sitting president.\n\nTrump had already threatened to fire Mr Smith if he regained the White House, telling a radio host last month he would sack the special counsel \u201cwithin two seconds\u201d of being sworn in as the 47th US president.\n\nOne of the cases was brought by Mr Smith in Washington and centred on Trump\u2019s alleged attempts to overturn his 2020 election defeat.\n\nThe second was filed in southern Florida over the former president\u2019s alleged retention of classified documents after leaving office.\n\nBoth had faced significant delays after Trump appealed to the US Supreme Court, which partly agreed with his claim that he had enjoyed broad immunity while president.\n\nAs president, Trump will have less control over the New York hush money case or an election interference case in Georgia, given both are brought by state prosecutors.\n\nBut his legal team has already said they will argue that a president should not face the burden of criminal prosecution while in office.\n\nHis lawyers and legal analysts are confident that his return to the White House makes it unlikely he will face legal consequences in either case during his term in office.\n\nThe case could still proceed against the other co-defendants, who include Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and White House chief of staff Mark Meadows.\n\nTrump had pleaded not guilty to all charges and cast the prosecutions as politically motivated.\n\n\u201cThe American people have heard these Democrat prosecutors\u2019 cases against President Trump and they\u2019re still going to elect him anyway,\u201d said Mike Davis, the founder of the Article III Project, a conservative legal advocacy group.\n\n**Read more from The Telegraph:** [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/06/donald-trump-legal-woes-vanish-us-election/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/06/donald-trump-legal-woes-vanish-us-election/)",
