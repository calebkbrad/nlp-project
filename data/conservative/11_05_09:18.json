It seemed like either his transcriptions were off, he wasn't understanding the questions, or he was intentionally trying to avoid them.\n\nThis was a one-on-one, casual conversation. The idea that he had transcription problems or didn't understand the topic are both bad, given he should be operating in busier, noisier environments. He made comments on Rogan's show about doing better following music he knows better than stuff that's new. I think he struggles with unfamiliar topics or ideas still, and that he showed difficulties in following the conversation properly on there. Despite having respect for him on a personal level, I think he just isn't in a good enough state to trust in that position.",

He votes straight in line with Warren, Sanders, Schumer, and all the other far left wackos. Fetterman is NOT to be trusted. Always check the voting record!\u00a0 \n\nThe only Democrats you can trust to think independently and regularly break from the leftist insanity is Krysten Sinema (who left the Dems in 2022 to become an independent and is not running for re-election) and Joe Manchin (who left the Dems this year to become an independent and is also not running for reelection).

The downside to doing it this late is he\u2019ll lose out on changing the minds of those who already voted but the upside is the media can\u2019t drown it out (at least not as well) so this will be in people\u2019s heads when they vote. \n\nI hope the calculus pans out in our favor.

I don't know if it's a conspiracy or a function of the polls. Still seems fishy, since the polls don't seem to have changed much in the last few days, except for the wild Selzer Iowa poll. They gave Harris the slimmest margin over Trump. So it seems like they want to give Harris a publicity bump, while still being able to claim they had \"barely\" given her the edge if she loses.",

He had Trump, Vance, and Fetterman on in the last two weeks and would have had Harris on if she had a brain.\n\n2. He's long-form. Short-form is just a series of soundbytes and recitals of obedience to dogmas. Rogan basically made this format and it's wonderful.\n\n3. He's generally libertarian and moved to my hometown because California is bullshit.\n\nWhat I don't like:\n\n1. I don't care about MMA, feats of strength or chimps.\n\n2. He doesn't push back enough with bullshit artists. I'm talking Eric Weinstein. I've been made to watch his interactions with this douchemonkey and it has left me irreversibly annoyed with him.\n\nI like Rogan as a person and like what he's done to national discourse, I just don't want to listen to his show.

         "I loved her Fox show too. O'Reilly and Megyn back-to-back were must-see TV for me for years. I can't stand any of the Fox prime time lineup ever since they booted Bill. It's totally predictable listening to three hard-line conservatives say the exact same talking points every day. The fact that Bill and Megyn were more unpredictable, and at least made it a point to challenge conservatives, simply made their shows more interesting to watch. If a Republican makes a mistake, the Fox prime time hosts now are so partisan that they will not acknowledge it. They'll just spin for them.\n\nMegyn has definitely said she's become more conservative now. I think she rated herself a 6-7 out of 10 recently on conservatism, which seems a little low. Years ago when Howard Stern asked her what her politics were, she said conservative on economics, liberal on social issues. She also said she voted for Trump in 2020 and 2024, and I assume that means she didn't in 2016. Her show now is definitely more to the right of her Fox show, but she will criticize Republicans if she thinks they made a mistake (she didn't like the non-Trump speakers at the Madison Square Garden rally much at all).",
         "Rogan doesn't seem to be in the \"pushback\" business. He actually reminds me more of Johnny Carson than any other talk show host these days. No guest had to worry about Carson digging up dirt on them or trying to debate them on the show. Some people blame Carson for helping promote Paul Ehrlich's devastatingly wrong junk science population doomsday theories when he had him on as a guest. But Carson's style was not to debate, disprove or discredit anyone. He simply gave them a platform and let them make whatever case they wanted to make. Watch him interview Siskel and Ebert, two supremely opinionated guys, and, even then, Carson never brings strong opinions of his own into the interview. He always maintained the kind of agreeable tone that Rogan had with Trump.\n\nFull disclosure, I've only watched a handful of Rogan interviews. But the Trump one gave me major flashbacks to Carson, in that Rogan did not insert his own opinions into the discussion very much, and was very gentle with how he addressed any controversial topics.\n\nI'd theorize that this moderate and even-handed approach is why Rogan is at the top of the heap of his industry, just as Carson was.",

         "When the brigade is going badly I recommend posting more often than normal. You can post up to four times per hour, even if all four are right after another.\n\nThe websites leftists use to pay for downvotes charge by the downvote, rather than by the hour of labor. So more posts means you drain their pre-paid account more quickly. Because posts downvoted to \u201czero\u201d tend to have more than one downvote, when there is more posts, paid brigading is more costly than when there are just a few posts, but with some upvotes.\n\nThat is a strategy against paid brigading, but it is not as effective against volunteer brigading. To wear them out, you\u2019d need even more posts.\n\nWhen the brigading is really bad, the mods might consider putting a sticky note up announcing that the four posts per hour limit has been suspended temporarily. Then conservatives could just post dozens of links each at a time until eventually it wears out the brigade.\n\nWould this actually work? I don\u2019t know, but it would be interesting to give it a try.\n\nAll leftists need is a credit card, and there are white collar workers in third world countries who will be happy to downvote whatever they want.\n\nSome Reddit users have described in the past spending what appears to be in the thousands of dollars on paid votes. It isn\u2019t cheap to put food on the table for hundreds of people halfway around the world.\n\nThe cost of 50 downvotes is $16.99, which comes out to $0.3398 per downvote. According to\u00a0[https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/country\\_result.jsp?country=India&displayCurrency=USD](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/country_result.jsp?country=India&displayCurrency=USD)\u00a0, one pound of white rice in India costs $0.33.\n\nI don\u2019t know how much of the fee actually reaches the base level worker, but even if it is only half, it still adds up over time.\n\nPaid Reddit voting makes you think about the kind of people who pay for downvotes. Same kind of people that might mess with an actual real life election.\n\nBut I accept that Reddit is twisted as sort of a fact of life. What I\u2019d be interested in seeing is a stickied title modeled as a charitable drive.\n\nLike\n\n**Today lets try and feed people from far off lands. Posting frequency limit is suspended for the next 24 hours. Post away so leftists employ people who need money more than they do.**",

These strategies are inconsistent. Right hand not talking to the left hand. The GOP has been trying to enforce strict mail-in rules for years, but that's only because the ballots were overwhelmingly from Democrats. The strategy to reject more ballots makes no sense if they want Republicans to switch to mail-in voting (However, in PA, the mail-in vote remained overwhelmingly Democrat this year. GOP usage only increased by under 10%, I think.). Bottom line, Democrats are not more likely to make errors on their mail-ins than Republicans.

They control almost all of online, hollywood, TV and print media, the education system, entrenched government institutions and bureaucrats, the biggest most monopolistic corporations and industries are all run by democrats. The only reason the communist label sticks is because it's organic and grass roots - because it's actually true. Many democrats are even ok with the label because they agree with it and self identify.\n\nAnd those who don't are de facto supporting communist/fascist/authoritarian government by voting for democrats at this point. Cancel culture and political correctness, suppression of opposition speech, manipulation of algos, media propaganda, abuse of power and lawfare against political opponents, use of identity politics to create division, full support of the establishment and patriot act surveillance state types, the party of top-down government control... I mean they literally just murdered some guy's innocent pet squirrel and racoon the other day in NY... I don't even know where to begin or where to end in explaining how the label actually applies to them objectively from a purely factual basis but not to us... So no it's not the same at all.\n\nWe can say you are a communist because X, Y, Z and list direct examples of them supporting policies that would undoubtably classify as that. Meanwhile they call Trump and us Nazis... but can't back that up with anything real. They say because he had a dog and Hitler did too... I mean there is some serious logical problem and disconnect from reality on one side compared to the other. Trump's about to be a grandfather to both jewish and arab grandkids too.\n\nIf you don't see the difference between the two sides here then your mind is so clouded by democrat conditioning and you are far gone. Survey after survey and real life event after event shows that modern day democrats are the intolerant ones. The hate is off the charts from them they are the same people who in nazi germany would report their neighbors and family members to the state. They have a bunch of the key psychological traits of nazis even their overwhelming use of projection which is why they literally gave us the label all over mainstream news even though it obviously makes no sense to anybody who spends more than a minute to think about it and has a brain larger than a pea.",

He was back on message today, and didn't say that kind of stuff. But the Selzer poll clearly had him disturbed Sunday morning.\n\nAnd that is on top of the narrative Trump has pushed since 2020 about the election being stolen.

This is who they are. Vote accordingly.",
         "It's not conflating issues, it's the mindset that infects all bureaucratic institutions. That the bureaucracy is correct and justified in its actions because they are following regulations written by that bureaucracy. It's basically caused by Pournelle's iron law of bureaucracy, that organizations are eventually taken over by people dedicated to the bureaucracy, rather than the mission.\n\nThis has nothing to do with state, local, or federal, it's a succinct demonstration of what happens when you let these agencies run wild and don't keep them reigned in. You want an example at the federal level? How about when Chuck Schumer warned Trump that the intelligence agencies had \"six ways from Sunday to get back at\" any president who dared to cross them. In other words, a bipartisan admission that these agencies have amassed so much power and have gone rogue and no longer answer to the elected head of the civilian federal executive as they are required to by law. And in fact they will take down anybody who tries to get in their way. Some unelected bureaucrats are completely above the law. That's far worse than this squirrel, right? The squirrel is not about one rodent being killed, it's the symbolism. The squirrel is us.",
         "It is a Democrat issue. They do this kind of stuff all the time. Waco, Eli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez, and I believe there was a dispute with ranchers more recently. This horrific tragedy is a direct result of the \"government knows best\" Democrat mindset. Reagan's famous joke about the scariest words in the English language being, \"I'm from the government and I'm here to help\" come to mind. What happened here was entirely predictable coming from a Democrat-run government. It is an exact mirror to the violent tyranny they routinely exact on the federal level, on tax issues, environmental issues, property issues, privacy issues, and others. Kamala said Trump would use the American military on our citizens, but it is a Democrat government who just invaded a citizen's home armed to the teeth and murdered their pets.",
         "It's not far worse. I can hardly think of ANYTHING worse that a government can do than violently invade a private citizen's home and murder their pets. Other than murdering the people themselves. This is a staggering invasion of privacy, violation of property rights, and infliction of emotional distress. No citizen in a free country should be subject to such brutality and terror."

Ultimately, she decided she had to vote on policies over any other factors, and she liked his policies better. I assume this meant she voted for Hillary in 2016, but she didn't say that specifically. She claims she has gotten more conservative over the years, and just recently placed herself at, if I recall, a 6 or 7 on the 1-10 scale of conservatism. Which surprised me a little that it was so low, because she sounds more conservative than that these days. She even implored her viewers to re-elect Ted Cruz.",
         "The number of people butt hurt about her asking perfectly legitimate questions at a debate is astounding to me. It\u2019s as if many republicans are no different than democrats and are only accepting of those who think exactly like them. Turns out there are republican NPC\u2019s too. I say this who has now voted for Trump 3 times. The general election. This kind of attitude is embarrassing."
