The \u201cno social unrest\u201d (#8) key arguably should be turned against Harris too.

Of course his result is going to be in line with most polls.  \n\n>but he\u2019s also technically predicting a Harris victory\n\nNot really.  It's inappropriate to interpret 50/50 (or even 55/45) as a firm prediction in either direction, and he would not say that he's predicting a Harris victory.\n\n>which keeps him in line with exit polling data and other data on the ground\n\nWhat exit polls have been released so far?  What \"data on the ground\" are you referring to?  Early voting is not predictive of election results, nor are things like crowd size.  Polls have their problems, but they are the best tool we have for gauging public opinion, and the merit of a model like this is that it is calibrated based on historical polling errors.  \n\nI really don't understand what people want when they make criticisms like this.  Nate Silver uses a transparent methodology that he announced in advance and that he doesn't change based on subjective vibes.  He has not changed anything in the methodology on the basis of late indicators, not is he trying to skew his model one way or the other.  He just added all of the polls that have been released so far and let the internal logic of the model do its thing.  \n\nHe is trying his level best to make a probabilistic forecast on the basis of the available polling data.  The available polling data indicate a true toss-up.  Maybe there are problems with the polls (for one thing, they may be herding towards a false consensus), but it's not the job of a polling aggregator like him to put his thumb on the scale one way or the other.  His model accounts for the magnitude of historical polling errors, but it doesn't assume that the error will go in one direction any more than the other (because historically, the direction of polling error is random).",

That key is about whether there was conflict around the nominee (which there was), not whether eventually everyone accepted the nominee. 99% of the time, people eventually accept the nominee. By your logic, that would mean the key should never be turned since it's very rare for a party to outright reject the nominee.\n\n\nSocial unrest I'd say has to do with the extreme polarization in the country and the fact that people are definitely gonna riot after the results. Again though, nate says it \"arguably\" should be turned. It's an ambiguous key.\n\n\nI think the third one is pretty self explanatory and hard to argue against.

Majority of the time, the party eventually accepts the nominee. Of course they all accepted kamala, but you're kidding yourself if you think there wasn't a fight for the nomination",
         "But the important thing about having a primary fight and it being bad for the nominee is you get the people who wanted the challenger to be the nominee and they wind up not supporting the nominee. There just aren't that many Democrats who firmly backed Biden but won't support Harris because Biden was replaced. There are no \"Biden or Bust\" people.",
         "Maybe you and Nate should actually try reading the keys. \n\nKey 2 (no primary contest) is turned true if the incumbent party nominee wins at least two-thirds of the total delegate vote on the first ballot at the nominating convention, with no deep and vocal party divisions.\n\nShe got two thirds of the total delegate vote on the first ballot and there was no deep and vocal party divisions at the convention. This is CLEARLY a true key.",
         "the reason a fight for the nomination is bad is because candidates spend months trash talking and knifing eachother and staking out maximally far left/right positions to appeal to ideological primary voters. who was competing with kamala for the nomination by doing that?",
         "I think the key is about whether the final nominee had to endure months of slap fighting with a challenger. Kamala Harris did not. People speculated on other nominees but ultimately even Tim Walz endured more of a fight the VP nomination than Harris did for her presidential nomination.",
         "Also, this is a key because you get the situation where the diehard supporters of the challenger aren't enthused by the nominee and either don't show up or actually vote against them You know, the \"Bernie or Bust\" type voters. But there aren't a significant number of Democrats who were supporting Biden but are mad that Kamala replaced him and won't show up for her.",

From its Wikipedia page:\n\n>Although most New Hampshire polling stations open around sunrise and close in the early evening, Dixville Notch takes advantage of a state law that allows a precinct to close if all registered voters in that precinct have cast ballots. Consequently, all registered voters in Dixville Notch gather and are counted before the balloting takes place.

         "This is not how sampling works, you don't need an appreciable fraction of the total to know with relatively little uncertainty what the total population looks like.\n\nWhen you randomly poll a voter, they're going to (for simplicity's sake), say candidate A or candidate B. Let's call P the fraction of the population that supports A (and 1-P supports B), the chance the random voter says A is then P, etc. If you want to estimate P, you just need to keep randomly finding voters and seeing what they say, the fraction of those randomly sampled voters that say A is your estimate of P.\n\nNow the uncertainty in your estimate doesn't depend on the population size. That might seem counterintuitive, but look at what we're estimating, the probability that someone says one of two things. That is the same problem as asking, say, whether a coin is fair--it's going to be heads or tails and you want to know the chance of each. Now the number of samples (coin flips) you need to certain in that case can't depend on the population, there isn't one, you're not drawing on some repository of flipped coins. You can do some maths and show that for something near 50/50 you need roughly 1,000 samples to estimate the probability of a binary outcome to within +/-3%, 95% of the time.\n\nNow of course what's tricky here is getting a random sample of voters. That's hard, arguably impossible really, so pollsters need to use workarounds like weighting. But notably you can't just solve it with polling more people if your methodology doesn't change--your sample will be just as biased by the underlying non-randomness. Suppose supporters of candidate A are twice as likely to answer the phone as supporters of B--it doesn't matter if you call 1,000 or 10,000 people, you're gonna find way too many people supporting A.",

         "> When Marco Gutierrez, a founder and spokesman for the little-known and sparsely populated advocacy group \u201cLatinos for Trump\u201d recently tried to warn America of the grave dangers of open borders and free migration with the image of \u201ctaco trucks on every corner,\u201d most viewers, Latino and Anglo alike, seem to have experienced a vision of a possible new utopia. The tag immediately trended on Twitter, not in panic but in near-universal celebration of the possibility.\n\n> What people do not know is how hard government has worked for years to prevent this from happening. The War on Street Food has been going on for more than 100 years.\n\n> It\u2019s just the most recent installment in a long, ludicrous history of American government\u2019s mean-spirited and petty war on tamales and tamaleros and Mexican street-food vendors in general.\n\n> > By 1901, more than a hundred tamale wagons roamed Los Angeles, each paying a dollar a month for a city business license. Their popularity spurred others in outlying cities to follow their example. In 1906, Sonoran immigrant Alejandro Morales began selling his wife\u2019s tamales from a wagon he commandeered through Anaheim. Morales, a ditch digger by trade, grew the concept into a restaurant, then a tamale factory, then Alex Foods, a multimillion-dollar empire now known as Don Miguel Mexican Foods. . . . It wasn\u2019t just Latinos who operated tamale wagons \u2014 African Americans, European immigrants and whites also partook in the industry. In 1905, even the YMCA opened a temporary tamale wagon to raise funds so it could send a boy\u2019s track and field team to compete in Portland, Ore.\n\n> But as the popularity of tamale wagons and Mexican street food spread, the established business press and Anglo governments increasingly looked on the vendors with suspicious eyes. In San Antonio, Anglo city fathers began a series of running regulatory battles to stamp out the threat of fresh chili con carne as they passed regulations and closed down public use of plazas to stamp out the entrepreneurial efforts of so-called \u201cchili queens.\u201d Food historian Jeffrey Pilcher notes that cities were remade in the image of nativist and protectionist fears about the disruptive effects of a laissez-faire public market in immigrant food staples.\n\n> The truth is that we could \u2014 and should \u2014 have had taco trucks on every corner, tamale wagons on every major thoroughfare, chili queens ruling every public plaza, decades ago if not for the suspicious gaze of city regulators, the protectionist interests of brick-and-mortar restauranteurs, the itchy hyperregulation of urban improvers, and the cosntant effect of border-control hysteria, nationalist culture policing and anti-immigrant moral panics.

I think Donald Trump and the MAGA \\[Make America Great Again\\] movement bring nothing but stupidity and chaos.'\"\n\nAnd he has had negative views on Trump for at least a year, because I saw a video where he interviewed Nick Fuentes last November and even then they frequently referred to the silliness surrounding, and emanating, from Trump (although Fuentes credits Trump for awakening his alt-right political views).\n\nWhich is all to say, if Richard Fucking Spencer, the poster boy of American neo-Nazis, is sick and tired of Trump's chaos and administrative incompetence, *so much so that he's willing to vote for a* ***woman*** *of color and urge others to do so as well*, you can assume he's not alone.\n\nI was nervous until I saw his endorsement.

We can simply vote and hope for the best. \n\nIn the mean time. I find solace that Kamala ran a damn near perfect campaign. Trump has the far right (no salvaging that voting bloc). But he did nothing to expand his base and ran one of the worst campaigns I\u2019ve seen in my lifetime. With that, Kamala needed to fit everyone from leftists to center-right moderates under her tent. I think she did a great job at messaging to everyone in those demos *and* staying positive, joyful, and confident. Her VP pick is one of the most likable politicians in the modern era. Her social media game is amazing and I think it shows in youth turnout so far. She did everything right. And she has massive momentum going into Tuesday. \n\nIf Trump still wins, then there was literally nothing any of us could do about it.",

         "I worry about the possibility that Donald Trump will win the 'old fashioned way', but even more that he might win through some bizarre trickery.  In particular, Eli Mystal has unlocked [a new fear](https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/little-secret-trump-johnson-election/) that the Republicans will employ skullduggery and a novel reading of the constitution to win the electoral vote by lowering the number of electors who are actually counted, thus the number needed for a majority.\n\n>...I think the plan is to steal the Electoral College outright by getting states Trump loses to refuse to certify the results of their election. That\u2019s because the 12th Amendment provides that the president is the person who wins the majority of the \u201cwhole number of Electors appointed.\u201d That \u201cwhole number\u201d is supposed to be 538. But one *potential* reading of the amendment is that Trump doesn\u2019t have to win 270 Electoral College votes but just a *majority* of however many electors show up. Trump\u2019s goal, I believe, is to decrease the number of electors appointed until he wins.\n\n>This reading is untested. Nobody has yet tried to win an election with fewer than a majority of the Electoral College votes by decreasing the overall number of electors appointed after the election. But it\u2019s an argument the Trump team could put forward, and it\u2019s an argument Democratic lawyers and experts are preparing for.\n\n>The first step in such a process is to get Republicans in states Trump loses to contest the certification of their own elections. In 2020, Trump and his team illegally tried to get slates of alternate electors submitted in states where Republicans control the state legislatures. They could try that again, but for this scheme to work, they don\u2019t even have to get \u201cfake\u201d electors submitted but just to convince Republican state legislatures or Republican governors not to submit their valid slates of electors before statutorily imposed deadlines. All slates of electors are supposed to be certified by December 11. Those electors are then supposed to vote and submit their results by December 25.\n\n>What this means is that Republicans just have to delay long enough to pass those deadlines. They don\u2019t have to win; they just have to stall.\n\nBefore this, there might well be chaos and violence, although I hope that enough Trump cultists will be too chickenshit to pursue what they profess to crave.  \n\nThere will surely be threats, at least.  In 2020 Donald Trump threatened the family of Al Schmidt, who was then a [City Commissioner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_City_Commissioners)\\* of Philadelphia, precisely because despite being a Republican, he assiduously and faithfully executed his office.  Now his is [Secretary of the Commonwealth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_the_Commonwealth_of_Pennsylvania), which could make him an even greater target for Republican rage.  \n\n\\*Elected officers who are responsible for administering elections in Philadelphia.  There are three and no party is allowed to hold more than two of the seats.  Commissioner Schmidt was the sole Republican in 2020; his prot\u00e9g\u00e9  Seth Bluestein holds that distinction now.",

That footage of MAGA cultists climbing the walls and breaking the windows was the type of imagery you see at the start of a history book chapter titled \u201cbeginning of the end\u201d, and most everyone just kinda went \u201cMeh, anyway\u2026\u201d",

A way more disastrous scenario was narrowly avoided, like imagine if the rioters had caught Nancy pelosi or Ilhan Omar in the halls with no security to protect them. People don\u2019t think about how close we came to an absolute nightmare scenario",
         "*Democrats* should have. *The media* should have. They should have done this for 4 years. January 6th shouldn't even be the shorthand for the insurrection attempt, it's a footnote. Especially when it comes to Donald Trump's involvement, which regarding Jan 6th was indirect.\n\nHe tried to overturn an election and no one believes it because the MSNBCs of the world are too hysteria-pilled to turn down the opportunity to focus on violent riots by Trump supporters instead of the very real and very serious crimes Trump committed in the process of trying to steal an election.\n\nFailure to properly message on this issue has brought us to the brink of a Trump reelection. Democrats failing to put this man away over the last four years will be, if he wins, their biggest failing.",

         "As they say, you cannot reason someone out of a position they didn\u2019t reason themselves into. There is no amount of evidence or rational argumentation that would convince these people otherwise. Your best way to change their mind is with absurdism \u2014 the same way Trump managed to capture their imaginations. \n\nSee, if he won the election he\u2019d still be president. He isn\u2019t. If he was cheated out of it, then he clearly failed to drain the swamp and is UNFIT to save America. You know, the great Lewis Hamilton was cheated out of his 8th world championship on live TV, and they even admitted it after. But he never complained. He took it like a champ and shook Max Verstappen\u2019s hand and congratulated his family. What do you mean sports and politics are different? I\u2019d like to see you drive a race car. I would like my presidents to be WINNERS who aren\u2019t sore losers. If TRUMP was a winner he would have FIGURED IT OUT.",

         ">They are young right-wing extremists who described themselves as \u2018Saxon separatists\u2019: The federal prosecutor's office had eight neo-Nazis arrested in Saxony on Tuesday morning, accusing them of right-wing terrorist plans. The arrests were made in the Leipzig area, in Dresden, in the district of Mei\u00dfen and one also in Zgorzelec, Poland. A total of 20 properties were searched. Several local AfD politicians are among the suspects. Shots were fired during one of the arrests.\n>\n>In addition to those arrested, the federal prosecutor's office also has seven other suspects in its sights. The group also has links to Austria, specifically to Vienna and the district of Krems, where searches were also carried out.\n>\n>The federal prosecutor's office accuses the group of having founded its right-wing terrorist organisation called \u2018Saxon Separatists\u2019 back in 2020. It was led by J\u00f6rg S., who was arrested in Zgorzelec. Four of those arrested - Karl K., J\u00f6rn S., Kevin M. and Norman T. - were still adolescents in the early days. The group is said to have comprised up to 20 people in total.\n>\n>According to the federal prosecutor's office, the group was \u2018militant\u2019 and its ideology was characterised by \u2018racist, anti-Semitic and in some cases apocalyptic ideas\u2019. The group was united by a \u2018deep rejection\u2019 of the basic democratic order in Germany.\n>\n>J\u00f6rg S. is said to have been the ringleader of the group. His grandfather was an FP\u00d6 politician in Austria. His father, Hans J\u00f6rg S. Jr., is a convicted right-wing extremist from Austria who was active in the militant neo-Nazi scene there in the 1980s. J\u00f6rg S. is said to have been arrested in Poland. One of his brothers, J\u00f6rn S., is also among those arrested. Searches were carried out on two other brothers, but no arrests were made.\n>\n>According to taz information, the suspects also include local AfD politicians Hans-Georg P., Kevin R. and Kurt H\u00e4ttasch.\n>\n>Hans-Georg P. sat for the AfD on Leipzig's East District Advisory Council until the end of 2022. Kevin R. has been a deputy member of both the social committee and the advisory board for culture, youth and sport in the city of Grimma for the AfD since August 2024. In 2021, R. was the \u2018media representative\u2019 and \u2018JA coordinator\u2019 of the AfD district association in Leipzig.\n>\n>H\u00e4ttasch is currently on the board of the same AfD district association in Leipzig and was elected to the Grimma city council in 2024. He was only elected treasurer of the Junge Alternative Sachsen in October.\nAt the end of June, H\u00e4ttasch was one of the participants at [a solstice celebration in Strahwalde, which was reported on by taz](https://taz.de/Rechtsextreme-Netzwerke-in-Sachsen/!6021990/). At the gathering, AfD politicians and members of the Junge Alternative met with neo-Nazis, hooligans and nationalists and glorified National Socialism: Hitler Youth songs were sung and an SS standard bearer was honoured.\n>\n>In spring 2022, photos show H\u00e4ttasch in Schnellroda, Saxony-Anhalt, travelling to the so-called \u2018Spring Academy\u2019 at the then \u2018Institute for State Politics\u2019 run by the new right-wing ideologue G\u00f6tz Kubitschek. The institute disbanded in May 2024 to avoid being banned. The events in Schnellroda were used for networking across the far-right scene. Martin Sellner, a leading figure in the Identitarian movement in Austria and Germany, can be seen in other photos from the Spring Academy 2022.\n>\n>Security sources confirmed to taz in the early afternoon that shots were also fired when H\u00e4ttasch was arrested in Grimma. He was injured in the jaw and had to be treated in hospital. H\u00e4ttasch had grabbed a weapon himself. Whether the projectile came from there or from a police weapon is still being clarified. Der [Spiegel](https://www.spiegel.de/panorama/schuesse-bei-festnahme-von-terrorverdaechtigem-afd-politiker-a-b2c0ff1e-934c-43ea-82a4-fb5945a976d1?sara_ref=re-so-app-sh) first reported on the shooting.\n>\n>The press spokesperson of the AfD Saxony, Andreas Harlass, told taz: \u2018We have nothing in common with such a suspected neo-Nazi \u201cseparatist group\u201d, neither in terms of content nor organisation. If the allegations against Mr H\u00e4ttasch are confirmed, he will be expelled from the party immediately.\u2019\n>\n>According to the arrest warrants issued on Tuesday, the right-wing extremists are said to have been convinced that Germany was on the brink of \u2018collapse\u2019. On the corresponding [\u2018Day X\u2019](https://taz.de/Bilanz-zum-Hannibal-Netzwerk/!5977591/), the group is said to have planned to use armed force to conquer areas in Saxony and possibly other eastern German states in order to establish a National Socialist regime there. Unwanted groups of people were to be \u2018removed through ethnic cleansing\u2019.\n>\n>The group is also said to have repeatedly carried out paramilitary training with combat equipment. They practised house-to-house combat, the use of firearms and night and forced marches. The group is also said to have obtained camouflage suits, combat helmets, gas masks and protective waistcoats.\nThe Federal Criminal Police Office, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution and the Saxony State Criminal Police Office were involved in the investigation. More than 450 police officers were deployed during the arrests and searches, including special forces. Austrian and Polish secret services were also involved.\n>\n>Thomas Haldenwang, President of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, explained in response to an enquiry from taz: \u2018Today's executive measures highlight the continuing high threat to Germany's internal security posed by right-wing extremism.\u2019 Some of the group's protagonists are very young right-wing extremists with links to a scene that is particularly active in virtual space. The followers of this so-called \u2018victory scene\u2019 or militant accelerationism glorify the deeds of well-known right-wing terrorists such as Anders Breivik and Brenton Tarrant. They pursue the goal of participating in an expected violent overthrow - Day X - of the political system.\n>\n>\u2018Siege\u2019 was originally a newsletter written by the US right-wing extremist James Mason for the National Socialist Liberation Front in the 1980s, the contents of which were later published in book form. [According to right-wing extremism expert Spencer Sunshine](https://taz.de/Autor-ueber-die-US-Neonazi-Szene/!6033065/), Mason has found his followers on image boards and in telegram groups in recent years - and inspired neo-Nazi networks such as the right-wing terrorist \u2018Atomwaffen Division\u2019.\n>\n>Konstantin von Notz, deputy leader of the Greens' parliamentary group in the Bundestag and chairman of the Parliamentary Control Panel, told the taz newspaper: \u2019Once again, it has become clear that the dangers posed by a steadily growing far-right scene are very real. The scene's high level of organisation is and remains extremely worrying.\u2019 Transnational networking is also progressing and far-reaching financial structures are being established. Links between the \u2018Saxon separatists\u2019 and other countries, not just Poland, must be systematically investigated. \u2018Where extremists network internationally, this must also apply to the security authorities. Together, they must take decisive action against cross-border threats,\u2019 said von Notz.\n>\n>Federal Minister of the Interior Nancy Faeser (SPD) spoke of a \u2018very important investigative success\u2019. The security authorities had \u2018thwarted militant coup plans by right-wing terrorists at an early stage, who were longing for a day X to attack people and our state with armed force\u2019. The fact that the group had trained with weapons and had already procured equipment shows how dangerous they were.\n\nhttps://taz.de/Festnahmen-von-Neonazis-in-Sachsen/!6046702/\n\n*Translated with DeepL.com (free version)*",

Two anecdotal bits of evidence:  One, the Seltzer poll shows increased support for Kamala from older voters who would be stereotypically  Republican.  Two, alt-right fringe figure Richard Spencer has publicly endorsed Kamala and stated that he voted a straight-Democrat ballot because the MAGA movement, to him, is too much about destruction and not really about governance.\n\nRichard Spencer is *not* a liberal.  He is anti-liberal.  He has been branded a neo-Nazi.  If even he so tired of MAGA that he's willing to urge others to vote for Kamala and the other Democrats, that makes me think that there's a significant white-non Hispanic-conservative Kamala vote that hasn't been accounted for.\n\nAlso, [the fancy United Kingdom \"mega-poll\" has Kamala slightly ahead](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/03/swing-state-mrp-mega-poll-00186941).  Why?  Again, \"Harris\u2019 advantage comes in part from her strong appeal to older white women, a historically right-leaning group. \\[However\\] Trump has made gains with younger Black and Hispanic men.\"  Once more, Kamala is drawing support from white voters who have chosen Republicans in the past.  And regarding those \"younger Black and Hispanic men\"?  They're still going to overwhelmingly show up for Kamala, just maybe not as much as they did for Biden.\n\nAnd of course, you have the [Allan Lichtman keys](https://youtu.be/xE22XjWEyQE?si=ldqieC4E5B7nvUdS).",

She knows the demographics, voting patterns, and history of every county in Iowa and exactly how many married 59 year old hardware store owners in Dubuque she needs in her respondent pool to have a representative sample.\n\nNot that I'm defending other pollsters, who clearly have a spotty track record and are engaging in some egregious herding this cycle, but Selzer's strategy is difficult to replicate with a larger and more diverse electorate.",
         "tbf to other pollsters, there's a decent argument that polling Iowa is unusually straightforward because it is racially, culturally, and economically homogeneous in a way that many states of interest aren't.\n\nOTOH, that's not unique to Iowa. The real reason is that Iowans are the last people in America who will still pick up the phone for an unknown number :V",

She listens to what voters are telling her and records that data down without judgement or manipulation.",

There's been a lot of strong evidence that pollsters this cycle are herding as well as using unsound methodologies to get results that are more favorable to Trump. So while normally I think trusting the polling aggregate to be accurate would make sense, there's a possible reasonable explanation for why we shouldn't trust the normal polling averages.\n\nIn that respect this poll has been a vindicating breath of fresh air as well as hope, that perhaps the polls this time will not underestimate Trump and in fact underestimate Harris. This type of swing between elections has been seen in Iowa before. In 2012 Obama won it by a margin of nearly 6 points and then in 2016 Trump won it by a margin of 9.

DMR/Selzer? 5), and it looks like there's no partisan bias to it either, the polls are just shit and are likely to massively miss in each direction because they're shit at modeling the electorate, so shit GOP Juche polls are correct half the time are MORE reliable than them.

However, because the sampling distribution follows a normal distribution, the poll would have to be **radically** and highly improbably off for polling estimates that aren't dangerous for Trump.\n\nLet's illustrate this:\n\n- The Selzer polls margin of error is +/- 3.4%, which should be ~2 standard deviations (stds). Likewise, it's widely believed that Trump +7 was the neutral-for-Trump outcome. \n- Let's assume Selzer is off by ~5% (3 standard deviations, 99.7% confidence interval). Then Trump still barely wins Iowa which bodes poorly for his chances in the actual Midwestern swing states.\n- Let's assume Selzer is off by double her margin of error (~7%, 4 standard deviations, 99.9% confidence interval).

It would mean more money and legislative energy spent on creating implements of war, which means less spent on building the European welfare state we've wanted for so long, sending money into the pockets of defense contractors and their engineer bro employees rather than the working poor. We've been begging for decades since the Cold War ended to build plowshares not swords only now for us to need swords again, **completely wasting the peace that we won in 1991**, which is really friggin depressing. We won an existential battle for the soul of humanity and then wasted the victory cutting welfare and invading Iraq instead of doing anything substantial to share the spoils or prepare for the next battle, and unlike healthcare reform bills, the next battle doesn't wait around for Republicans to stop filibustering. The next battle is already here.\n\nIt would mean raising taxes or facing further inflation, both are politically unswallowable. It would mean exposing ourselves to risk. The risk of being caught with unsavory allies, or with people who answer to us going off script and doing something unethical, and we'd rightly feel guilty for that. It would mean encouraging the war to continue so we could leverage it to our advantage, whilst having no blood in the game, which would expose us to moral disgust by our peers for using the blood of others as a ladder for power.\n\nWe're scared. We're afraid that if we stand up to the bully, we'll become him, if not in reality then in the eyes of our friends and peers. We're scared to do the right thing and accept that history may not record our actions kindly. We're scared our grandchildren will hate us as we do our grandfathers.\n\nAnd most of all we're scared that if we admit any of this, we'll prove Bush's sycophants and toadies that all their taunting of us for daring to have a conscience about our power was right, and the next time they start an unjust war we'll lose it again. Defending Kuwait in 1990 saved millions of lives. It also doomed millions of others by making 2003 easier to start by blotting Vietnam out of memory and replacing it with our victory.

      "comments": [
         "> Just days into his presidency, Indonesia\u2019s new leader has sent a strong message to foreign tech companies looking to sell in the world\u2019s fourth-most populous country: invest locally or lose access to the market. But analysts warned that strategy, which remade Indonesia\u2019s economy as a commodities powerhouse, could backfire against the likes of Apple and Google as competition in the region for foreign direct investment heats up.\n\n> Over the past week, Prabowo Subianto\u2019s government has banned sales of Apple\u2019s iPhone 16 and Google\u2019s Pixel phones, citing the companies\u2019 failure to meet requirements for 40 per cent of products to be made with locally sourced raw materials. \u201cWe\u2019re encouraging the local content policy to create fairness for all investors, as well as to create added value domestically,\u201d Febri Hendri Antoni Arief, a spokesperson for the industry ministry, said on Friday.\n\n> The bans, which came a week after Prabowo was inaugurated, signals that south-east Asia\u2019s largest economy could step up the use of restrictive trade policies to secure investments from foreign companies. Critics said such policies could dent Indonesia\u2019s appeal \u2014 which is already hampered by red tape and corruption \u2014 against more investment-friendly nations in the region such as Vietnam and Malaysia. The restrictions also come as Prabowo has laid out ambitious plans to boost annual economic growth to 8 per cent. \u201cIndonesia takes a hit in its competitiveness compared to other countries in south-east Asia as a result of this kind of policy,\u201d said Lydia Ruddy, managing director of the American Chamber of Commerce in Indonesia. \n\n> Ruddy said it could be \u201cvery challenging\u201d for foreign companies to meet local content threshold because domestically made products are not available for some sectors such as electronics, pharmaceuticals, medical devices and renewable energy. \u201cThis becomes a real deterrent for foreign investors. If they cannot import the products or materials they need and they are not available on the local market yet, companies will look to other markets in the region,\u201d she said.\n\n> Indonesia has long used trade regulations to attract foreign investment and onshore manufacturing to protect its domestic industries. The local content requirement is one of its strongest mechanisms, requiring industries from energy to agriculture machinery to locally source a certain percentage of goods. For power plants, it is as high as 70 per cent. This year, Indonesia relaxed the local content requirement for solar power plant projects in a bid to facilitate foreign investment. The energy minister at the time, Arifin Tasrif, said the requirement had made projects much more expensive for foreign companies. \n\n> Indonesia\u2019s protectionism has been even more aggressive in commodities. Prabowo\u2019s predecessor Joko Widodo banned nickel ore exports in 2019, forcing foreign companies to invest in domestic nickel processing facilities. The policy drew record investment in the steel and electric vehicle sectors, both of which use nickel extensively. While Prabowo has said he will be investment-friendly, he is yet to lay out detailed plans. He has vowed to continue Widodo\u2019s policy of \u201cdownstreaming\u201d, or adding value to commodities, to boost the value of the country\u2019s exports. At the Qatar Economic Forum in May, Prabowo pushed back against criticism of Indonesia\u2019s \u201cdownstreaming\u201d policies. \u201cWe are not protectionist,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we are doing is very logical. Every country in the world will fight or protect the national interests of its people.\u201d\n\n> His government\u2019s recent moves indicate a focus on technology companies. In the final weeks of the Widodo administration, officials said they would ban Chinese ecommerce platforms Temu and Shein because of the potential harm to small- and medium-sized enterprises from cheaper foreign products.\nPrabowo\u2019s administration has not commented on the bans on Temu and Shein. Indonesia holds great potential for companies such as Apple and Google due to its young, tech-savvy population. The number of active mobile phones in Indonesia totals 354mn, according to the country\u2019s industry ministry, exceeding the population of 280mn. Indonesia has previously called for more investment from Apple, which has four developer academies in the country to train students and engineers to develop apps but no manufacturing facility.\n\n> The Widodo administration had asked Apple to set up a factory or research and development centre, saying the developer academies were not enough, but Apple\u2019s chief executive Tim Cook, who met Widodo in Jakarta this year, did not make any commitments. The ban on Apple and Google is an attempt by Indonesia to have more bargaining power, but it is a tough sell because \u201cIndonesia still lacks the manufacturing capabilities\u201d, said Bhima Yudhistira, director of the Center of Economic and Law Studies in Jakarta. \u201cThis is a bad precedent for investors and potential partners for Indonesia under the Prabowo administration,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government has failed to increase the fundamental competitiveness to attract more investments.\u201d"

         "This reminds me of Lee Kuan Yew's \"From Third World to First\". It's interesting because it talked about Vietnam with much more focus on the late 70s and 80s Doi Moi reforms. Refreshing since most Western journo articles solely focus on the US war while making filmbro references. Nothing about the important events after the war, including more regional tension, which led to what Vietnam is today.\n\nIt's still an outsider perspective but one of a regional neighbour (calling it the Asian \"Prussia\" and being initially supportive of Deng's stance against Vietnam), rival (until the economic hardships and isolation of the 1975-1991 Indochina Wars quagmire led to a diplomatic vibe-shift in Vietnam) and later economic partner.\n\n> In October 1991 Vietnam and all parties signed agreements in Paris for a comprehensive political settlement. A week later, Vo Van Kiet, now the prime minister, visited Singapore. Although I was no longer prime minister, we met when I attended a dinner for him given by my successor, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong. As the dinner was breaking up, he rose, walked up to me, held my arms in a semi-communist embrace, and asked whether I would help Vietnam. I asked, how? By becoming their economic adviser. I was speechless. I had been the target of their virulent attacks since their occupation of Cambodia. Recovering from my surprise, I said that my experience had been confined to a city state, that I had no experience of a big country like Vietnam with a population of 60 million people, a country devastated by many years of war and working a communist system that had to be transformed into a market system. He persisted and followed up in two letters.\n\n> After an exchange of letters, I agreed to visit them, not as an adviser, but to brainstorm ideas on their change to a free-market economy. It was a totally different relationship when I went to Hanoi in April 1992. In an ornately decorated conference chamber, with Ho Chi Minh\u2019s bust as the centrepiece, I spent a whole day with Vo Van Kiet and his team of ministers and top officials. They had five questions, starting with what commodities Vietnam should focus on in its modernisation, in what markets and with what partners. I replied that the questions themselves disclosed a mindset that came from long years of central planning, because they assumed there would be specific commodities, markets or partners that could bring about a transformation for them. I suggested that they study the process through which Taiwan and South Korea had transformed themselves from agricultural into newly industrialising economies. A good strategy, I said, would be to use South Vietnam, especially Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon), as the dynamo to get growth going for the whole country. Communism had prevailed in the north for 40 years, but for only 16 years in the south. People in the south were familiar with a free-market economy and could easily revert to working the old system. The best catalyst would be their \u00e9migr\u00e9s \u2014 Vietnamese refugees who had left after 1975 and done well in business in America, Western Europe and Australasia. Invite them to return and kick-start the economy in the south, since they would want to help their families and friends.\n\n> Kiet seemed attracted to the suggestion. He himself was from the south, but other, more senior leaders wanted development to be spread equally, north and south. Unstated were their apprehensions that these \u00e9migr\u00e9s would return with subversive ideas or with links to foreign agencies like the CIA.\n\n> Kiet flew to Ho Chi Minh City from Hanoi for a final meeting with me. He asked me to return every year, saying I had been a real friend because I had given honest and sincere advice, although sometimes it was painful to hear. I promised to return within two years. In the meantime, I would send a task force to study their infrastructure short-comings and make recommendations on their seaport, airport, roads, bridges, telecoms and power supply.\n\n> Our officers believed the Vietnamese wanted me to be associated with them to get closer to Asean and be more secure vis-a-vis China. Singapore had been Vietnam\u2019s most vocal opponent. If they normalised relations with us, foreign investors would have greater confidence. We decided to put the past behind us and help them as best we could to adjust to the market economy and become compatible partners in Asean.\n\n> Kiet was soft-spoken, but his record as a communist underground fighter belied his gentle ways. They were formidable opponents who had great determination and fighting spirit. In my note to the cabinet I described Vietnam\u2019s terrible state, although it was six years after their opening up. In 1975 Ho Chi Minh City could vie with Bangkok; now (in 1992) it lagged more than 20 years behind. I felt that for the time being the people had lost confidence in their leaders, and the leaders had lost confidence in their system. However, they were an energetic and intelligent people, Confucianist at the grass roots. I believed they would bounce back in 20 to 30 years.",
