But rather because \u201cthings are bad and need to radically change\u201d is the message of the Republicans, but also enough in the Democratic base to make it untenable.\n\nEven if Kamala wins, this is a problem that\u2019s not going away.

In this recovery, we also made the biggest investment in our infrastructure we've ever made to repair decades of neglect, and we're bringing manufacturing back ensuring that the technology of the future is designed and manufactured right here in America, and we'll continue to lead the world on fossil fuel production as we build the future. The work isn't done though, while our economy might be the envy of the world, it's still too expensive for millions of Americans, we are dealing with high housing costs, high education, and high medical costs, and we can talk about or solutions. But tell a story of how we got here, make people think about what we went through, give people a sense of pride and duty, and make them think about what the administration actually accomplished the last 4 years.

It's that if it doesn't conform with their priors, the \"Occam's razor\" explanation (from their point of view) is that it's bogus or you are a misinformed or bad-faith actor. It's actually quite rational to suspect that a new piece of information, which doesn't conform with the overall analysis done on loads of additional data, is faulty in some way, rather than that the analysis is bad or the loads of other data is bad. The real problem is that people are quite bad at assessing their own competency at evaluating their own data and experience, and so they tend to vastly overestimate the accuracy of their existing priors. People DO change their minds eventually after new information is hammered into them over and over again, but they are unduly skeptical of this information because they are too confident in the accuracy of their priors.",

Showing low unemployment, rising real income, rising rate of home ownership, and one of the fastest post-COVID declines in inflation rate out of developed countries means nothing as long as they can just dig up one other stat that isn\u2019t as pretty. 10 good core stats and one bad one apparently mean the economy is terrible.\n\nAnd most of the time the statistic brought up is \u201cpeople living paycheck to paycheck\u201d. Which is a terrible statistic. I\u2019ve dug into the surveys that get quoted for that, and they never actually define the term, they leave it up to the interpretation of the survey taker. So someone making $200k a year and maxing out their 401k contribution can still be living \u201cpaycheck to paycheck\u201d if they feel like they spend their full paycheck, even if it\u2019s on many optional luxury purchases. It makes the metric useless. On top of that, there\u2019s very little historical record of the statistic. It can\u2019t be compared to the 2000s, or 90s, or 80s, or any decade before that, so we have no idea what a regular rate of people giving that answer is, either in a good or bad economy.\n\nNone of it is to say we shouldn\u2019t be making things better for people, but damn some people just want to look hard for a reason to be angry, or want their own situation in life to be extrapolated to everyone.",

We have a long history to look back on, and we can ***see*** that people today are not reacting to this relatively mild and brief inflation spike like they have historically.\n  \nWith previous spikes of inflation, the public reliably dropped it as a top of mind topic when it dipped below 5%.  That happened a year and a half ago, yet people point to inflation as THE driver of economic sentiment.  That's completely divorced from current economic reality and all historical precedent.\n\nPeople are right to be surprised when people start reacting differently to circumstances than is typical.

         "I worry about the possibility that Donald Trump will win the 'old fashioned way', but even more that he might win through some bizarre trickery.  In particular, Eli Mystal has unlocked [a new fear](https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/little-secret-trump-johnson-election/) that the Republicans will employ skullduggery and a novel reading of the constitution to win the electoral vote by lowering the number of electors who are actually counted, thus the number needed for a majority.\n\n>...I think the plan is to steal the Electoral College outright by getting states Trump loses to refuse to certify the results of their election. That\u2019s because the 12th Amendment provides that the president is the person who wins the majority of the \u201cwhole number of Electors appointed.\u201d That \u201cwhole number\u201d is supposed to be 538. But one *potential* reading of the amendment is that Trump doesn\u2019t have to win 270 Electoral College votes but just a *majority* of however many electors show up. Trump\u2019s goal, I believe, is to decrease the number of electors appointed until he wins.\n\n>This reading is untested. Nobody has yet tried to win an election with fewer than a majority of the Electoral College votes by decreasing the overall number of electors appointed after the election. But it\u2019s an argument the Trump team could put forward, and it\u2019s an argument Democratic lawyers and experts are preparing for.\n\n>The first step in such a process is to get Republicans in states Trump loses to contest the certification of their own elections. In 2020, Trump and his team illegally tried to get slates of alternate electors submitted in states where Republicans control the state legislatures. They could try that again, but for this scheme to work, they don\u2019t even have to get \u201cfake\u201d electors submitted but just to convince Republican state legislatures or Republican governors not to submit their valid slates of electors before statutorily imposed deadlines. All slates of electors are supposed to be certified by December 11. Those electors are then supposed to vote and submit their results by December 25.\n\n>What this means is that Republicans just have to delay long enough to pass those deadlines. They don\u2019t have to win; they just have to stall.\n\nBefore this, there might well be chaos and violence, although I hope that enough Trump cultists will be too chickenshit to pursue what they profess to crave.  \n\nThere will surely be threats, at least.  In 2020 Donald Trump threatened the family of Al Schmidt, who was then a [City Commissioner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_City_Commissioners)\\* of Philadelphia, precisely because despite being a Republican, he assiduously and faithfully executed his office.  Now his is [Secretary of the Commonwealth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_the_Commonwealth_of_Pennsylvania), which could make him an even greater target for Republican rage.  \n\n\\*Elected officers who are responsible for administering elections in Philadelphia.

         "Yes, of course. It would be foolish not to be worried. Trump is a walking disaster and is a hair's breadth from the presidency.\n\nHowever, worrying solves nothing. All we can do is vote (if you haven't already), volunteer (text bank tomorrow, cure ballots after election day), and hope.",

Or the voter demographic they go after. We can\u2019t change how people will accept that messaging or how \u201crational\u201d other people\u2019s opinions are. We can simply vote and hope for the best. \n\nIn the mean time. I find solace that Kamala ran a damn near perfect campaign. Trump has the far right (no salvaging that voting bloc). But he did nothing to expand his base and ran one of the worst campaigns I\u2019ve seen in my lifetime. With that, Kamala needed to fit everyone from leftists to center-right moderates under her tent. I think she did a great job at messaging to everyone in those demos *and* staying positive, joyful, and confident. Her VP pick is one of the most likable politicians in the modern era. Her social media game is amazing and I think it shows in youth turnout so far. She did everything right.

She knows the demographics, voting patterns, and history of every county in Iowa and exactly how many married 59 year old hardware store owners in Dubuque she needs in her respondent pool to have a representative sample.\n\nNot that I'm defending other pollsters, who clearly have a spotty track record and are engaging in some egregious herding this cycle, but Selzer's strategy is difficult to replicate with a larger and more diverse electorate.",
         "tbf to other pollsters, there's a decent argument that polling Iowa is unusually straightforward because it is racially, culturally, and economically homogeneous in a way that many states of interest aren't.\n\nOTOH, that's not unique to Iowa. The real reason is that Iowans are the last people in America who will still pick up the phone for an unknown number :V",

However, because the sampling distribution follows a normal distribution, the poll would have to be **radically** and highly improbably off for polling estimates that aren't dangerous for Trump.\n\nLet's illustrate this:\n\n- The Selzer polls margin of error is +/- 3.4%, which should be ~2 standard deviations (stds). Likewise, it's widely believed that Trump +7 was the neutral-for-Trump outcome. \n- Let's assume Selzer is off by ~5% (3 standard deviations, 99.7% confidence interval). Then Trump still barely wins Iowa which bodes poorly for his chances in the actual Midwestern swing states.\n- Let's assume Selzer is off by double her margin of error (~7%, 4 standard deviations, 99.9% confidence interval). That's STILL pretty bad news for Trump in the other swing states. 99.9% means that, if we repeated the Selzer poll 1000 times, only ONE of those times would fall outside of that confidence interval.",

Maybe Selzer is the outlier here, but in both of the last two elections Selzer\u2019s final polls looked like outliers and were totally correct. \n\nI\u2019d rather be Harris.

It is possible that plains states and/or NC and Georgia are moving towards the center while AZ and Nevada move toward Trump\n\nIn fact, I would go so far as to say that the tendency to group the Midwest together as a single cultural unit could be entirely wrong. It's possible that western PA and Michigan break right while Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota, etc break left. These are all different places with different dynamics. People using the Iowa poll to predict the rest of the Midwest are making lots of assumptions.",
         "> Every data point is showing a close race except the Selzer poll\n\nVarious data points besides polling have been pointing to a Harris victory. Enthusiasm, Dobbs still being a factor, a large gap between Harris and Trump in small dollar donations, the Washington primary indicating an environment slightly to the left of 2020, and the fact that Democrats overperformed their polling averages in swing states in 2022.\n\nPew's NPORS found that this is an R+2 environment, but was released when Biden was still in the race and Democrats were heavily demoralized. The 2020 census under-counted many heavily Democratic-leaning demographics. Both of these things, to the extent that pollsters use them when weighting, will throw off polling in Trump's favor. Then there's just the fact that fake Republican pollsters are spamming the polling averages with garbage polls and that pollsters absolutely do not want to underestimate Trump for a third time in a row, which incentivizes them to tilt the race towards him.",
         "Individual district polling has also been good for Harris showing her either maintaining or improving on Biden\u2019s margins in important counties.\n\nThat would also be more positive akin to the Selzer poll. Individual district polling is oftentimes more accurate than state level or national polls.\n\nOh and my hometown of Omaha. Harris is crushing Trump there per the most recent polling, widening Biden\u2019s margin as well. There is some room for optimism.",
         "Also the Nevada prediction is based on the assumption that the Independent and crossover support splits are close to what polling shows. If Harris is winning a vastly greater amount of Independents/Republicans than polling averages predict, like what Selzer shows, you would not know until the election is actually over.",
         "In Nevada specifically, I wonder if we're starting to see another factor come into play. Not to put too fine a point on it, but the rise of \"Barstool conservatism\" in the last several years has tilted a particular demographic -- young, male, blue-collar, multiracial, and unapologetically lowbrow and \"live and let live\" in their cultural tastes -- towards the right, a demographic that is often stereotypically associated with Nevada thanks to that state's heritage with gambling and the \"sin\" industries more broadly. While I'm expecting the realignment of women (especially since the *Dobbs* decision and the resulting backlash) to carry Kamala Harris to victory by a wider margin than the polls are predicting, I would not be surprised if Nevada bucks the national trend and winds up going down to the wire. Whichever way it ultimately tips, I can see GOP activists and strategists taking a very close look at the state in the years to come, to see what they did right.",

I have observed that the reasons have evolved over time.\n\n> First, it was claimed that Europe was not paying its fair share. That was proven incorrect. Our allies have already contributed more than $96 billion in aid\u2014and the EU earlier this month agreed to provide $54 billion more over the next four years.\n\n> Next, it was argued that we should instead focus on the Pacific and Taiwan, but Taiwan and Japan and South Korea tell us that the single best thing we can do to dissuade CCP aggression is to support Ukraine.\n\n> Next, we were told that we couldn\u2019t afford the $60 billion for Ukraine-related funding. But somehow, we can afford an $850 billion defense budget and annual trillion-dollar deficits, which has happened under both former President Trump and President Biden.\n\n> Next, it was claimed that we would have insufficient weapons to defend America and Israel if we sent more weapons to Ukraine. But, the Department of Defense has explained that helping Ukraine will actually strengthen our national security by helping to rebuild our depleted military industrial base.\n\n> The latest excuse for denying aid to Ukraine is that this bill is a clever disguise to set up an impeachment of Donald Trump at some point in the future. Under this so-called logic, Trump has to be elected, Democrats have to win the House, and those Democrats would have to have been unable to find any other indiscretion of President Trump\u2019s upon which to base an impeachment.\n\n> I know that the shock jocks and online instigators have effectively riled up many in the far reaches of my party.

Milton Friedman was a self-described libertarian, and some libertarians claim him as one of them just as you'll see a lot of Friedman flairs on this sub. They are always welcome to join us at the corner taco truck.\n\nThere are points of agreement between the camps on some approaches and issues - just as there are between Neoliberals and Progressives or even Neoliberals and \"Social Democrats\" or - kinda - some Socialists.\n\nBut most (not all) of the precepts that ground libertarian thought are different from those that ground liberalism and especially neoliberalism.\n\nI will say that you'll often see points of agreement, connection and \"crossing over\" between consequentialist libertarians (those who see libertarian ideas as the best pragmatic means to positive outcomes) and neoliberals.\n\nBut there are also really important differences:\n\nMost neoliberals share a belief in the importance of constructive institutions to ensure the proper function of the rule of law, democracy and free markets - locally, nationally and internationally. We're globalists and big fans of wonkish technocratic policies in finance and trade. Multilateral alliances and cooperation FTW. Libertarians see \"constructive state/mandatory institutions\" mostly as an oxymoron, and definitely are not okay with international institutions having any kind of umbrella regulatory or market interference role;\n\nMost neoliberals recognize the importance of a good social welfare state and openness to non-market distribution to alleviate acute and also *chronic* distress, secure broad support for open, free, democratic and market driven societies. Desperate, starving and miserable people are usually less productive and more stabby, and liberalism's moral core is the inherent dignity, liberty and worth of the individual human being. Libertarians share some of this moral core, but are usually hostile to social support programs, seeing the taxes that fund them as a morally offensive deprivations of liberty and a socially destructive necessary evil at best.\n\nThe importance of a pragmatic and proactive role for the state in ensuring the best infrastructure and groundwork for free markets, innovation and growth to flourish. We prefer free markets like Libertarians, but will use public enterprise where there is a clear and definite advantage over a market solution. Libertarians are less pragmatic and more idealistic - they only accept government intervention where there is no other possible choice; and\n\nWorms. Neoliberalism is about worms.

         "I'm kind of not a huge fan of the distinction between \"classical\" and \"modern\" liberalism. I think social liberalism is every bit as much of an evolution in the liberal tradition as right wing or \"classical\" liberalism. It is not only us who have changed, there's plenty that \"classical liberals\" say that would be unrecognizable to actual liberals from the periods they claim to emulate. There's a whole bunch of social darwinism thrown in there from late 19th century thought, and they just pretend like that's not a big deal. It's not. \"Classical\" liberalism forecloses in specific and distinct ways many questions that had previously been more or less open within liberalism. Just the same as modern social liberalism has. They put on the pretense that their developments of these questions is the authentic and original interpretation, but that's putting on airs. \n\nThe actual figures they are quoting would have simply been confused had you gone up to them and started talking with some of the assumptions that classical liberals take for granted - these assumptions were developed later on, and would appear novel to them. It always stuns me when right wingers think of themselves talking in the voice of the founders or whatever, pronouncing angrily on what is going. These speculated founders always talk as if they had full knowledge of the intervening events between their time and ours, and knowledge of specific arguments and types of discourse that are in fact entirely modern cliches. There's simply no chance that a person who lived at that time could even say much of what they're saying. But they don't think of this. \n\nJust imagine George Washington died, and in the interceding 250 years of debating himself in heaven happened to as he was watching jump onto all the bandwagons in the interim that a modern conservative would have thought it appropriate at that time to jump on? Then what would he say? It's such a stupid thing to think, like clearly the interceding 250 years of bandwagon hopping and building up grudges based on that probably dominates whatever speculated ideology George Washington ever had, which mostly would have been things that the leader of a small Atlantic nation could have at that time been aware of and noticed at that time. So why don't we just discuss the 250 years of grudges themselves? And get directly to the matter, as I think that's where the heart of the issue probably lies. But no, we have to run a seance with a speculated version of George Washingtons soul who happened to have made all the decisions you think would've been right in the interim.

         "> When housing is scarce, when prices are high and homes are unaffordable for average Americans, who do we blame? For JD Vance, the answer is simple: immigrants.\n\n> During the Oct. 1 vice presidential debate, Donald Trump\u2019s running mate claimed housing is unaffordable because \u201cmillions of illegal immigrants [who] compete with Americans for scarce homes.\u201d Just this week, he accused Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, of \u201cmassively violating\u201d zoning laws by having multiple families living in the same home.\n\n> Vance\u2019s rhetoric perpetuates the same racism that caused housing to become scarce in the first place. Apartment bans and other exclusionary laws were written to keep people of color out of white neighborhoods. These outdated laws have caused a nationwide housing shortage that continues to segregate our communities and stifle the middle class. Laws that were originally intended to keep people of color out are now also keeping all young people, all middle-class people and all low-income families weighed down with high housing prices and ever-longer commutes.\n\n> Vance\u2019s reductive reasoning is also based on a fundamental lie: that the amount of housing we have is fixed and that we must fight against each other for the homes that do exist. What JD Vance \u2014 and all of us \u2014 must instead acknowledge is that it doesn\u2019t have to be this way.\n\n> We don\u2019t have to fight one another for scraps. We can build enough housing for everyone.\n\n> It\u2019s common in shortages to blame, to hate, to pick scapegoats. Relying on the age-old tactic of manufacturing anti-immigrant hate to win votes, Senator Vance brazenly blames a small group of individuals for a problem that exists because of a chronic housing shortage brought on by decades of bad policy. Blaming people for a systemic issue prevents us from getting to real solutions.\n\n> The housing shortage is caused by regressive zoning and byzantine permitting processes that stall or halt housing production altogether. Cities reserve land for housing but only allow a small number of homes on that land, which limits the number of people who can live in the community. In communities with many amenities like high-quality schools and high-paying jobs, demand for those homes increases. If very few homes can be built, prices skyrocket. As the shortage worsens, people are pushed into poverty and overcrowding. Everyone feels the squeeze as prices rise.\n\n!ping IMMIGRATION&YIMBY",

A lot of Democrats juggle two careers PLUS having kids. The kids conflict with career demands, so they don't make that much extra money, and the conflict brings a ton of extra stress not nearly outweighed by the increased income.\n\nPolarization means Democrats mostly only model on other Democratic parents. \"Be a homemaker and prioritize kids\" isn't an acceptable choice for many Democrats.

         "# Reno Mayor Hillary Schieve\n\n> The mayor of Reno, Nevada, argues that the single best thing city leaders can do to help solve one of the country's worst housing shortages is to loosen regulations on housing construction.\n\n> In recent years, Mayor Hillary Schieve has launched a multi-pronged approach to do just that.\n\n> \"Sometimes government needs to get out of the way,\" she told Business Insider in a recent interview. There's no quick solution, said Schieve, who isn't a member of either major party and has made housing and homelessness a top priority.\n\n> With the election approaching, Nevada voters cite the economy as among their top concerns. Rising home prices and rents, which have hit the Sunbelt state particularly hard, are a big part of that. Since January 2017, home prices have risen 90% and rents are up 53% in Nevada, far outstripping national growth rates, Alex Horowitz, the director of Pew's housing-policy project, told Business Insider.\n\n# What's she doing?\n\n> Under Schieve, Reno has loosened some of its regulations by allowing for more density, reducing parking requirements, and cutting fees. Since 2019, the city says it has waived $11 million in sewer hookup fees and $700,00 in building permit fees to help bring more than 2,000 units of affordable housing to the market.\n\n> Schieve, the former chairwoman of the US Conference of Mayors, said Reno's rules regarding affordable housing construction are relatively lenient. However, she argued that some county and state regulations slow down home building, inflating costs and deterring new construction.\n\n> She took particular issue with county health department regulations that impose lengthy review processes. \"Most developers are borrowing money,\" she said. \"So time is money.\" Schieve's chief of staff noted that swimming pool construction, including in housing developments and hotels, \"takes an incredible amount of time and an incredible amount of money\" to get approved by the department.\n\n!ping YIMBY",

         "Archived version: [https://archive.fo/DWbhV](https://archive.fo/DWbhV).\n\nSummary:\n\n> Ukrainian officials said on Monday that their forces had fired at North Korean soldiers in combat for the first time since their deployment by Russia to its western Kursk region.\nThe clashes mark the first direct intervention by a foreign army since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in 2022, as well as an expansion of what was already the largest land war in Europe since the second world war.\n\n> \u201cThe first military units of the DPRK [Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea] have already come under fire in Kursk,\u201d Andriy Kovalenko, Ukraine\u2019s top counter-disinformation official within the national security council, said on Telegram. A senior Ukrainian intelligence official confirmed the military engagement to the Financial Times but declined to provide further details.\n\n> In Kyiv, foreign minister Andrii Sybiha said he had discussed with his visiting German counterpart Annalena Baerbock the \u201cneed for decisive action\u201d in response to North Korea\u2019s deepening\u00a0involvement in the war.\n\n> [...]\n\n> The US on Monday called out Russia and China at the UN Security Council for \u201cshamelessly protecting\u201d and emboldening North Korea. South Korea and the EU also condemned the deployment and expressed concern that Russia could reward North Korea with transfers of nuclear and ballistic technology.\n\n> Another senior Ukrainian official told the FT that Moscow was already providing military technologies to Pyongyang to help with its missile programmes, as well as \u201cmoney\u201d.\n\n> [...]\n\n> US and South Korean officials last week confirmed Ukraine\u2019s assessment that around 8,000 North Korean troops were sent to Kursk last month to help Russia\u2019s army push Ukrainian forces out of territory they have occupied since August. Senior Ukrainian intelligence officials told the FT that the forces were in barracks about 50km from the Ukrainian border and preparing to enter the fight within \u201cdays\u201d.\n\n> Kyiv, Washington and Seoul said that Pyongyang had sent roughly 12,000 troops in all to Russia for its ongoing war effort, including 500 officers and three generals. The remaining forces are located in Russia\u2019s far east, where they are undergoing training.\n\n> The White House has said that the North Koreans would become \u201clegitimate military targets\u201d if they entered the fight against Ukraine.\n\n> Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Friday that Ukraine could see where Russia was gathering the North Koreans and urged western nations to lift restrictions on long-range weapons to \u201cpre-emptively\u201d strike them before they could attack his forces.\n\n> The senior Ukrainian intelligence official declined to provide specifics about the first military engagement between his country\u2019s forces and the North Koreans. But he said that it occurred within Russia\u2019s Kursk region, where Ukraine controls some 600 sq km of territory, or a little more than half of what it previously held following the summer incursion that took Moscow by surprise.\n\n> Ukraine\u2019s military intelligence directorate, the GUR, said over the weekend that Russia had armed the North Korean troops in Kursk with 60mm mortars, assault rifles, machine guns, sniper rifles, anti-tank guided missiles and shoulder-launched anti-tank rocket launchers. The GUR said that some were also provided with night-vision devices and thermal imagers. A few hundred troops from North Korea\u2019s special forces have also been deployed in Kursk.\n\n> Ukrainian officials and military analysts have raised questions about the quality and combat effectiveness of the North Korean troops, with most being described as inexperienced, low-ranking soldiers.\n\n> \u201cWe will know soon\u201d how well they can fight, said one of the officials on Monday.\n\n!ping Ukraine&International-relations",

Consequently, polls are so blunt and insensitive to movement that they are missing differences between the 2024 and prior electorates.\n\nKamala's growing strength among college white voters, women voters, and older voters will hit Trump hard, these voters are high propensity and motivated.  Black and latino voters will to some degree return home to their historical patterns, as the Trump-curious among them are not highly motivated.  Trump's gains among young men will have limited impact as these are unreliable, low propensity voters who are also not highly motivated as a group.  Trump's strength among the terminally online is not electorally significant.\n\nMoreover, the race has experienced a not insignificant late shift due to Trump's increasingly erratic behavior and poor campaign messaging.

Harris has the better policies, platforms, ground game etc while Trump has been shrinking his voting base.

She has also lost major ground in the sun belt, making those states go from a blue lean to a toss up to a pretty big red lean. This makes her path to winning very, very limited. If Pennsylvania is red, Harris loses in most scenarios because she has no other EC votes to fall back on. Furthermore, inflation has prompted significant anti-incumbent sentiment that I feel will turn suburban voters against Democrats and back towards Trump, because stuff was cheaper back then (lack of economic merit to that argument aside).

         "Common Botswana W",
         "I posted this in the DT on election day, but now that I have a more official source that consolidated everything I wanted to post it on main.\n\nDuma Boko is the new President of Botswana from the left wing coalition Umbrella for Democratic Change. Boko's UDC beat the BDP which was in charge of Botswana since independence.\n\nBoko is a Harvard educated human rights lawyer and has represented LGBT organizations and individuals in the past. He endorsed the move to decriminalize gay sex in Botswana, which was successful. He's an ally.\n\nBotswana under the BDP also recently proposed laws to protect intersex people from discrimination.\n\nThe main LGBT rights organisation in Botswana is LEGABIBO: https://legabibo.org.bw/",

Everywhere I look seems to imply that Boko is *already* president, effective basically immediately the day after (or even day OF) the election result, which seems a little unusual? It\u2019s especially striking when contrasted with the new President of Indonesia, who only formally took office a few days ago despite winning the election way back in February.",

We've had 15 years without him, and continue to use him as an excuse to indulge our fear in the face of danger.\n\nWe all know what response would mean. It would mean more money and legislative energy spent on creating implements of war, which means less spent on building the European welfare state we've wanted for so long, sending money into the pockets of defense contractors and their engineer bro employees rather than the working poor. We've been begging for decades since the Cold War ended to build plowshares not swords only now for us to need swords again, **completely wasting the peace that we won in 1991**, which is really friggin depressing. We won an existential battle for the soul of humanity and then wasted the victory cutting welfare and invading Iraq instead of doing anything substantial to share the spoils or prepare for the next battle, and unlike healthcare reform bills, the next battle doesn't wait around for Republicans to stop filibustering. The next battle is already here.\n\nIt would mean raising taxes or facing further inflation, both are politically unswallowable. It would mean exposing ourselves to risk. The risk of being caught with unsavory allies, or with people who answer to us going off script and doing something unethical, and we'd rightly feel guilty for that. It would mean encouraging the war to continue so we could leverage it to our advantage, whilst having no blood in the game, which would expose us to moral disgust by our peers for using the blood of others as a ladder for power.\n\nWe're scared. We're afraid that if we stand up to the bully, we'll become him, if not in reality then in the eyes of our friends and peers. We're scared to do the right thing and accept that history may not record our actions kindly. We're scared our grandchildren will hate us as we do our grandfathers.\n\nAnd most of all we're scared that if we admit any of this, we'll prove Bush's sycophants and toadies that all their taunting of us for daring to have a conscience about our power was right, and the next time they start an unjust war we'll lose it again. Defending Kuwait in 1990 saved millions of lives. It also doomed millions of others by making 2003 easier to start by blotting Vietnam out of memory and replacing it with our victory. We're scared of our own success being a platform to become the bullies we hate.\n\nAnd I don't just mean liberal hawks. I don't just mean American liberals. I mean westerners, altogether, have failed Ukraine because of our fears of ourselves."

We have a nice selection of $20 salad chains close by, so workers can get connected with their local community and explore the ethics of tipping and delivery apps.\n\nEvery quarter we will layoff a part of the workforce, creating an air of excitement in our shared spaces.

The kid will go months without a break and then end up sick so he HAS to take a day off.  And then he is pissed his paycheck is smaller.   He is young and healthy so I guess go for it while you can, but I worry about burnout!  M-W-F he isn't home from sports until 10 pm and he leaves for school at 7:30 am.   \n\nI admire his work ethic, of course, but people need rest too.",

         "The issue is twofold:\n\nFirstly there's the sunk cost fallacy.  Offices, whether leased or owned, are huge investments.  For the leases the companies hate being locked into the lease for something they're not using.  For owners the real estate is often a large part of their monetary value and a CRE crash caused by permanent widespread WFH would severely harm their valuation.\n\nSecondly there's the tax breaks.  Most of those offices come with sweet tax breaks for the company and those breaks are given on the assumption that the municipality will make more taxes off of the economic activity of the office workers than they lose from the breaks.  Those breaks won't be continued if the offices aren't providing the traffic they did when the breaks were offered.",

For a simple example, in a presentation, a coworker was trying to scroll to the bottom of a data series in an excel spreadsheet. I came off mute and kindly suggested they just hold control and press the down arrow key. They told me, they are almost there and have their way of doing things. 15 people then waited another minute for them to find the bottom after already waiting a minute. All this bullshit adds up. But, we both know blaming old people for this is horseshit. There are just as many unproductive people my age and younger.

I also work with a 25 year old that is on their phone on Instagram everytime I go by their desk to find out why they haven't got back to me on a simple ask.\u00a0\n\n\nThe real issue is just that some people don't give a fuck, do the bare minimum, and have managers that let them. The issue is definitely not people taking mental health days or using the benefits that are part of their employment package. Nobody has to explain to you why they are taking a day off, and if they say headache, it's a headache and none of your business. If they abuse said benefits that is between them and their manager.

Another five signed similar certificates in 2020 but were not charged. And at least six others played notable roles in challenging the results of the 2020 election or promoting election conspiracy theories.\n\nAll told, at least 1 in 5 prospective Trump electors from battleground states this year had some connection to the scheme to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nThere\u2019s little reason to believe that Trump or his allies would attempt to reenact the false elector scheme, given the prolonged criminal proceedings against the fake electors and the maturation of the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d movement. But the reemergence of these Republicans demonstrates the power that election denialism continues to hold in a Republican Party led by Trump, who routinely foments false claims of voter fraud \u2014 and has deployed some of those same false claims to raise doubts about the 2024 election.\n\nRather than being punished or shunted aside for their role in an attempt to overturn a democratic election, they\u2019ve been elevated.

If we get crime rates high enough, housing prices will fall drastically.  There is a shit ton of data on exactly this, and in fact, unlike with stemming immigration, this will pay dividends right away, as stemming immigration won't lower housing prices, it'll just slow down growth, but increased crime rates is pretty much guaranteed to lower prices in a way that only straight up deportations would do.  \n\nBut you might be asking, Zenning3, won't the increased crime rates cause businesses to shut down, cities and towns to fail, and massively hurt the economy as a whole, while also just making us unsafe?

I haven't heard anything to suggest it was.\n\nMy point is more just that this is the *difference* with a dog, that a dog would have been vaccinated as it's a legal requirement, you can't have a dog and not vaccinate it. The squirrel was being kept illegally and I presume, wasn't vaccinated. And he also had an illegal racoon which is high risk for rabies; two thirds of all rabies exposures in New York are from racoons, double every other species put together. They can pass it on to a squirrel.\n\nWhile it's a very low risk that a squirrel bite would give you rabies, the consequences are severe. It's a guaranteed horrible death if the squirrel did have it and you didn't go through post-exposure prophylaxis because you felt it was unlikely.\n\nI'm not saying I agree the squirrel absolutely had to be killed, either. They could have started PEP on the worker that was bitten and monitored the squirrel for 10 days. On the other hand, rabies PEP including immunoglobulin can be pretty painful if you don't have pre-vaccination and I can understand why someone might like to avoid that if they possibly could.

Instead they quarantine the dog and observe it for signs of rabies. You could do the exact same thing with a squirrel. It would be pointless, because like I said, you can't get rabies from a squirrel. But if you were extra paranoid you could do exactly that.\n\nMind you, none of this is even touching on the fact that this only happened because cops barged into someone's house and tried to handle an animal when they clearly had no idea what they were doing. Because of that the blame of the bite should be placed solidly on the shoulders of the cop, which makes the squirrel dying even more outrageous.

(We saw this with Biden being more progressive with this admin than he ever really was in the senate.) \n\n> That led to a series of decisions he made as transportation secretary \u2014 nudged along by antitrust thinkers in the administration, a longtime friend and advocates calling for remaking the airline industry [...]\n\n\n---\n\nGood for Buttigieg to come onto a more progressive stance and see just how corporations use their size and influence against the benefit of consumers.

If leftier voters decided to reliably vote for and support Dems for a decade, they\u2019d find that they would start getting a lot of things they want.

It just took him seeing it firsthand to change his perspective and ideology towards how the government should work with the industry.\n\nI think much of that change is because as mayor and a consultant, he would not have seen that side of corporations.
