      "title": "This election wasn\u2019t lost because of your least favorite interest group",
      "text": "In the coming days, dozens of post-mortems will be published trying to dissect why the Democrats lost. Fingers will be pointed everywhere, and more likely than not everyone will look for a myriad of reasons why the Democrats lost, be it certain issues, campaigns strategies, constituencies defecting, etc. This election will be viewed as a catastrophic failure of the Democratic Party on brand with 2004. Every commentator across the political spectrum will claim that had the Democrats just gone with their preferred strategy, then Kamala would be President-elect right now.\n\nI think it\u2019s safe to say that all of that is reading too much into it. The Democratic Party was in complete array. Progressives, liberals, moderates, centrists, whoever, fell in line behind Kamala as the candidate. Fundraising was through the roof, the ground game had a massive amount of energy and manpower in it, and Democratic excitement was palpable.\n\nBy all accounts, the Democrats showed up and showed out for this election across the board. Unfortunately, that isn\u2019t enough. It kept the bottom from falling out like in 1972 or 1980, but the vast majority of independent and swing voters broke for the Republicans. A majority of the nation, for the first time in 20 years, put their faith in the governance of the Republican Party.\n\nThe median voter exists in an odd, contradictory vortex of mismatched beliefs and priors that cannot be logically discerned or negotiated. You just have to take them at their word. If they say they don\u2019t like inflation, it\u2019s because they believe that Biden is making the burgers more expensive. No amount of explaining why Trump\u2019s economic policies are terrible, or why Biden\u2019s policies were needed to avoid a massive post-COVID recession, or why they\u2019re actually making a paycheck that offsets inflation, will win them over. \n\nIn view of this, it was probably impossible for Kamala to win. She secured the Democratic base, made crossover appeals, and put forward some really good policies. And it worked. Her favorables are quite good, higher than Trump\u2019s, and it\u2019s obvious that she outperformed whatever Biden was walking into. Her campaign had flaws, certainly, but none nearly as obvious and grievous as Trump\u2019s. \n\nKamala being perceived as too liberal didn\u2019t matter. The Democrats being too friendly to Israel (or not friendly enough) didn\u2019t matter. Cultural issues didn\u2019t matter. Jill Stein didn\u2019t matter. Praising Dick Cheney didn\u2019t matter. The reality of the American economy didn\u2019t matter. If issue polling is correct, even immigration didn\u2019t really matter, and is mostly viewed as a proxy for the economy. \n\nWhat mattered was that 67% of voters thought the economy was doing poorly, in spite of most of them thinking that their own financial situation was fine. Voters want to see a low price tag on groceries, a DoorDash fee of $10, and a 3,500 sq. ft. house on the market for $250k, even if it means 10% unemployment and low wages for workers. Of those things, they associate it most with Trump, as much of a mirage as that is, and were willing to accept everything else for the chance to have that back. This election isn\u2019t a victory of all of Trumpism necessarily, or even a complete failure of the Democrats. It\u2019s a reminder of the priorities of the voters that will decide the election, in spite of how good your campaign was, or how economically sound your actually policies were. There\u2019s a hell of a lot that people will look past in order to have a cheap burger again.\n\nIf there is a failure, it\u2019s that Democrats spent to long believing that there could ever be a return of civility and normality. There was a clear and evident reluctance to use the full power of the state against the insurrectionists and crooks, chief among them Donald Trump. Biden thought that he could restore the soul of the nation and get people to respect and value the unwritten rules of politics that have guided us through the current liberal era. As it turns out, voters don\u2019t even care for the written ones.\n\nDon\u2019t blame the progressive, or the liberal, or the centrist Democratic voter. This election wasn\u2019t really on them. They voted. They probably donated, walked the blocks, or did some phone banking. They did what they were supposed to. If liberalism is to weather the coming storm, it will need the tent to stay intact, readjust, and come back stronger for 2026 and 2028. ",

Dems spent trillions on a progressive wishlist. There's no way that Dems didn't contribute just a little bit to inflation. Not just that, but what spending they did do had to be talked down to please Joe Machin.\n\nThen there was this rethinking of traditional antitrust laws where instead of believing in the consumer welfare standard, progressives believed that breaking up companies for the curse of being too big should take precedence. Progressives wanted to \"fight\" big tech and even though those companies were producing services that people love for a reasonable price, but they're \"big\" and \"wealthy\" so government had to go after them. All it did was make enemies out of traditional allies and gain them nothing in return. But who cares as long as the government is \"fighting\".\n\nThe lurch to the left hurt the country economically, chased allies out of the party and towards the GOP,  and made Dems more insufferable.",

We\u2019re in unprecedented times, but if Trump pushes through his promised agenda, we could see something of a 2008 repeat. Strong Republican wins in 2004 lead to a later collapse.\n\nI have my strong doubts that Trump will be able to navigate his way out of rising prices without a recession (which brings its own issues). There\u2019s a chance we see something like what\u2019s happening with Labour right now, where the party coming into power can\u2019t really roll the clock back to pre-2020 where people want it.\n\nOf course, the alternative is that people adjust to the current economy (which is very very good atm) and come to approve of it. This also has precedent- look at how much people hated the ACA until during the Trump presidency.\n\nThat said, I\u2019m not going to hang my hat on anything. It\u2019s the day after the election, and it\u2019s going to be a long four years. Making projections this far out is a bit useless. However, the best hope for a comeback is Trump actually doing what he\u2019s said he\u2019s going to do, so it\u2019s a bit up in the air right now.\n\nThere\u2019s certainly hope here, I think a 2028 comeback is possible, but the most important thing for Democrats is recapturing the flow of information",

         "I don\u2019t think Kamala was a near-perfect candidate, nor do I think the campaign was near-perfect. \n\nThe reason people see Trump as a strong leader is because they associate him with a good economy. Plenty of people hate him, even more than Kamala, but think that he\u2019s a guy who gets things done. It has the shades of Bill Clinton after his presidency, though Clinton\u2019s actual approvals were far higher. \n\nMy point is that neither Biden nor Kamala would have ever really been able to effectively position themselves as the \u201cchange\u201d candidate. I think Kamala should\u2019ve broken from the Biden Administration a LOT more, but given how she\u2019s the VP there\u2019s only so much of that you can do. I think another Democratic candidate that wasn\u2019t attached to the administration would\u2019ve done better, but a) it was impossible at the time Biden dropped out and b) there were still plenty of headwinds against the Democrats.\n\nSometimes the electoral environment doesn\u2019t favor you, and as we\u2019ve seen in every democracy across the world except for Mexico, incumbent parties have taken a beating as a result of the post-COVID recovery. With the factors at hand, the Democrats ran a good, not flawless campaign and maximized a candidate who was altogether average. \n\nDo things change if Biden drops out way earlier and allows for a full primary? Probably not, but maybe a bit. At that point you\u2019re getting into counterfactuals. The important story is that nothing the Democrats actually did in their campaign or on their policy mattered when compared to the overwhelming perception that the economy sucked.

Any post mortem begins with candidate selection, and how we evaluate or push out incumbents. \n\nThere may not have been a silver bullet candidate or campaign, but we went from Biden (an incredibly unpopular incumbent) to his VP with essentially no consideration of anyone else. \n\nIf we had seriously evaluated Biden as a candidate, and rejected him like a year and change ago, then we would have seen serious competition with serious candidates and have had a better (not a guaranteed, but better) chance of finding a potential silver bullet. \n\nInstead, at every turn, democrats acted to minimize infighting.

How do you as the Harris-Walz ticket win back the trust and confidence of that person and every single person like them across the US who supported you in only 90 days? \n\nNow add in all the negative vibes and realities of this election.\n\nTo me its actually kind of crazy how of all the things that lead us to this point, the biggest lesson we're probably going to take is \"never run a woman again lol\" when the sitting president himself did more damage to not just his campaign, but the credibility of the institutions themselves. \n\n\"Yeah, but Trump is worse\"\n\nYeah, he is. He's so much worse and he's going to do much worse than his 1st term. But liberal institutions and our leaders as they stand inspire absolutely no confidence.",

         "In a nutshell: \n\n1. Biden should've run as a caretaker president from the get go and realized that he wouldn't be a viable candidate to run in 2024. \n\n2. During the 4 year term Biden more or less should've done the same stuff, but in that time he and the Democrats should've groomed some potential successors (ideally 3-4 of them). \n\n3. About 1 year before the election run a Primary and select a candidate \n\n4. Run that candidate with Tim Walz as VP candidate (he was a good choice tbh) \n\nI think a lot of people were (rightfully) ticked off b/c they felt that Kamala was just handed the nomination and they weren't given a fair say in who got to run after Biden decided to step down. I get that they were kind of doing it in the interests of time, and of course hindsight is 20/20, and it's sort of a \"reverse Catch-22.\" \n\nKamala did everything right....it's just that people felt Kamala wasn't the right choice. So that kinda screwed things from the beginning.",

         "Honest to god and this might sound mean, but I legit think some of it is that a lot of men were just unwilling to vote for a woman. Like the Trump campaign focused a lot on that and it just seems to have stuck. Looking at the statistics more so than any other demographic, men shifted towards Trump. Hell white people shifted away but men generally shifted towards him. The biggest take away I think is that the democrats should have started getting someone ready to take Bidens place way earlier. Like in all honesty if the democrats ran a Latino guy for this ticket, this probably would\u2019ve been a shoe in.\n\nGoing forward all there is to do is hope that democrats and some moderate republicans can stem as much damage as they can. Trump absolutely doesn\u2019t care about the process and neither do his supporters but unfettered political power also doesn\u2019t often lead people to amazing decision making. It is possible that over the next 4 years trump just burns out the party as the promises he made can\u2019t be kept. He might crash the economy with his tariffs and deportation plan, world allies may turn to more local alliances, Hell given the state of Japan and how the other countries in the region feel at the moment, Ishibas Asian nato idea may not be looking too bad to some of them.

But, if I just told someone random about this client anywhere in the country and said \"Hey this client wants to borrow some money from you,\" they'd laugh.

I know she did the swing states, but Trump did far more there, she just have restrictions on her campaign like only doing certain hours apparently.\n\nMuch of the postmortem I'm seeing right now is that it was inevitable, But I don't see the blowout that we just saw being inevitable like this. I think the big takeaway needs to be that Democrats need to stop relying on policy wonks to run their campaigns, and start getting marketers. It's clear that the messaging has become more and more inward and is not connecting with the masses. They need to realize that the demographics they're going for have different priorities and they need to discuss those priorities head on i.e. economic concerns over social concerns. It's clear from the propositions that have passed or nearly passed that Democrat ideas are popular, but they're messaging is just not on point. And they really need to go for charisma with the next candidate over policy. They did the latter with Hillary and even Kamala in a sense, and it did not work.

They either explicitly favored Trump or chose stood idle against attempts to deceive voters with misinformation.**  They did it because there were zero consequences for them doing it if Harris won, and they knew Trump would come after them if they didn't & he won.

When that crisis occurs, the actions that are taken depend on the ideas that are lying around.\"\n>\n>--Milton Friedman\n\nNeoconservatives and neoliberals need to reflect on the civil consequences of the capital-poltical machines they have created instead of pointing fingers at everyone else.  The macro-economic landscape is not indicative of the personal financial health of people and their families.  On top of that, you have the political leverage of wealth that disgusts working people.  \n\nWealth has too much political leverage. People think it's because these people can buy politicians, and that is certainly true, but the actual leverage, if you're big enough, is the economy itself and therefore the stability of the nation. This is what makes institutions like JP Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, et al. and the people behind them, almost untouchable institutions in terms of criminal liability; they pay fines over and over again, but the fines are merely the cost of doing business and are mostly there as window dressing to make the public believe we live in a rule-governed society, and not a tiered plutocracy.\n\nThink about the knock-on effects of this and what happens to civic/cultural standards like \"Impartial Justice\" when the economic system and power structures needs to persist for the sake of national stability and what sort of leverage that creates for those that have the capital to disrupt the status quo if they, their wealth, or way of life is ever threatened; there is no accountability or meaningful consequences.  These institutions invest in and prop up the public and private pension system, 401Ks, education funding, health insurance, the US bond market, etc.  Its what enables the criminal behavior without fear of consequence that disgusts working Americans and this sentiment has been around since and before the 1889 Johnstown Flood.\n\nThe financialization of our economy has creates and cements oligarchical control/influence over the judicial and legislative systems; what little effect regulatory agencies have is dwarfed by immense personal economic incentives to not enforce the rule of law via the revolving door between regulatory agencies and industry. You cannot have an unbiased justice system if systemically important companies (by themselves or via their organizational owners) lever their economically valuable position to skirt laws or any sort of criminal liability. It undermines democracy and creates 2-tiered justice, which breeds and pressurizes political cynicism, depressed apathy, and anger, ultimately erupting into violence among the voting electorate. All of which should sound very familiar to the US and wavering western democracies.\n\nThe third-way has damaged democracy more than most care to admit, solely because of its inability to rein in abuses of political leverage wrought from capital.  Instead we brag that coastal blue states subsidize heartland red states, without any reflection on what happened post 1960 in those local communities.",

There is very little alignment between what conservatives claim they want and what the Republican party has/wants to achieve. \n\nI've regularly heard my conservative friends and family, most of which will vote for Trump and understand very little about policies the Democrats and Republicans pursue at the national level, complain about the following:\n\n* Wanting a better healthcare system, despite Democrats being the only party that has ever wanted and achieved legislation to make healthcare more accessible and affordable. \n* Wanting better public transit, despite Democrats being the only party that wants and achieves increased federal funding for transit. \n* Wanting more funding for infrastructure, despite Democrats being the party that wants and achieves increased infrastructure funding.\n* Wanting more domestic manufacturing, despite Democrats achieving a major domestic manufacturing bill. \n* Immigration, despite Republicans purposely nose-diving a very conservative-leaning bill just for political reasons (conservatives have somehow blocked this out of their voting calculus, of course).\n* Cleaner air, despite the Democrats being the main pushers of renewable energy, improved fuel efficiencies, electric vehicles, more sustainable land use patterns, and alternative modes of transportation. \n* Complaining about \"political division\" despite voting for a person who has completely brought on the worst aspect of American political discourse. \n\nThe list goes on. Most Republicans have mentally walled themselves off from ever being able to fairly compare the two parties. They would vote for a Republican 10x worse and more corrupt than Trump if they were on the ballot. \n\nRepublican voters are not like Democrat voters. There is a reason election lies, COVID conspiracy theories, and other blatant falsehoods are so easily spread amongst conservative voters, they are willfully ignorant and okay with creating new realities around themselves.

They look down on \u201cborder hoppers\u201d for \u201ccutting the line\u201d and assume that they are the bulk of southern border immigrants (as opposed to asylum seekers or lottery admits like themselves)\n\nI think if you hear some of the stories of how awful economic conditions were under many of these so-called socialist governments, you\u2019d understand. Even basic stuff like loans we take for granted don\u2019t exist and the ramifications are massive. for example my aunt couldn\u2019t get a mortgage or even save money to buy a home because of inflation. She\u2014any many others\u2014had to stockpile construction materials and build their home piecemeal paycheck by paycheck. \n\nLastly, can\u2019t ignore good ol Catholicism and machismo. Forget about abortion, forget about the gays, and definitely forget about trans people. These issues have been major net losers with Latinos for cultural/religious reasons. There is a progressive Latino movement but it\u2019s small and faces a lot of headwind because South American cultures are far more socially conservative than USA as a baseline. \n\nAll in all, I see Miami Latinos embracing the GOP for coherent reasons, even if I fundamentally disagree with them",

If they're buying that vibe, then they aren't voting democrat.   \n  \nIt's more likely that the majority of that 30% is making a strategic decision limited by the fact that we are in a two party system, so the only way to have a third option on the laws that govern you is to split the ticket.\n\nEdit:\n\nSumming the listed candidates votes, roughly 5.5m voted for president, and roughly 5.5 million voted for governor \n\nThe difference is less than 100k voters and doesn't account for write ins\n\nSo being generous and rounding to 0.1m voters, about 2% voted for trump and trump only.

         "  \nFundamentally this is the cannibal electorate problem writ large.\n\n  \nIf you are unfamiliar it goes a little like this.\n\n  \nComing up too the electoral period a new party enters the race, their major policy? They want to eat a certain minority,.\n\nWhile this may seem extreme they fully embrace the democratic process, there is no shady business behind the scenes, no thugs at polling stations, they just passionately believe that it would be a better tastier world, if a certain minority including you and your family was barbecued and eaten.\n\nObviously outraged by this, you march, you campaign, you do everything in your power, to point out that these guys are crazy and by no means should anyone vote for them.\n\nAnd then it comes up to election day and the worst happens, the cannibal party wins, the electorate has decided that barbecue sauce, is in your immediate future.\n\n\n\nSo we have a conundrum here, obviously you don't want to be the main course at a state sanctioned banquet, but it is undeniable the country has come to this terrible choice because they freely want it.\n\nSo what is the reasonable course of action, some like our Atlantic author here would say something like \n\n\"keep protesting and voting the system will sort it out\" which is easy for them to say, because they are not likely to be on the menu.\n\nThe issue is you can't defeat the problem through democratic mechanisms, if the problem is that the democracy is headed by a anti democrat, backed by a antidemocratic majority. \n\nOr you can recognise that the system worked fine, this is the choice made, and decided what combination of hide, fight, flee you want to do.",

         "Eh I'm feeling pretty nihilistic today. Maybe it will pass. But right now it feels like we as a country have forgotten lessons of the past and were not going to relearn them until we feel the consequences again. Things like Democratic principles, international order, vaccines, not electing narcissistic maniacs are all longer-term values that it's hard to sell the value of compared to perceived short term benefits. I don't think any amount of volunteering or campaigning is going to convince people these things are important again.",

Twitter is and, to a lesser extent, Facebook are both propaganda for the right. Podcasts like Rogan and Theo Von reach a ton of persuadable voters. They were effectively used as right wing propaganda. Rogan has been useful for right wing propaganda since covid. \n\nStill the left doesn't have a real counter to these things. It feels like democrats are only going to win elections after Republicans come through and break everything. Obama seemed like a long shot candidate at first but we really only got him because Bush broke the economy.",

         "It's best to have no faith in the American public.  Trump will take credit for the inflation that the economy has right now under Biden and the public will buy it.  They will consider themselves vindicated in voting Trump by observing the spillover of Biden's economy.\n\nThe best suggestion I heard from anyone is that Biden should issue everyone a massive stimulus check on his way out, signed with his name.  Everyone will worship the ground he walks on and Trump will be blamed for the inflation caused this profoundly stupid but brilliantly evil idea.\n\nAmericans deserve nothing less.",

         "Based on his mental decline in the last few years, the chance is much higher.\u00a0\n\n\nVance is gonna be president at best by 2026",
         "That is a terrible justification. I believe that anyone who thinks like that, just wants an excuse to vote for Trump.",

         ">Well, this is why we have a liberal democracy. Voters can't decide you're on the menu, no matter how much they want to, because the government simply doesn't have that power.\n\n  \nTheoretically.\n\n After all the cannibalism is a metaphor, for example the state absolutely has interfered with womens reproductive medicine in the past few years to the point some have died.\n\nWhat do you do when a majority of the electorate are ok with women dying avoidably to satisfy their beliefs?",
         "Who cares at this point. Our institutions and norms have eroded so far our country is barely recognizable.",
         "Ever known a junkie?  Or someone of that persuasion?\n\nYou can beg and you can plead and you fight tooth and nail and put every last bit of your soul into it, but if they're determined to destroy themselves there's nothing you can do about it.\n\nIf Americans are capable of learning, it will only be the hard way, by suffering the consequences of their own unfathomable actions.\n\nAnd I've had to deal with too many junkies or their like already to recognize the signs of the type incapable of taking a lesson.\n\nI don't know about apathetic but you'll excuse my profound skepticism that America will ever be better than the monster it's shown us to be.",

         "My brother in Christ they tried to overturn a free election right in front of everyone\u2019s eyes. If they didn\u2019t change after that, nothing would change their minds. We need to stop making excuses for the American people. They support authoritarianism.",
         "depends on how much of it would turn out to be suicidal",
         "Pretty much, Trump got fewer votes than last time.",
         "The South being uninhabitable is a positive",
         "Yeah he's gonna take credit for Biden economy initially, but if he puts his tariffs in place or actually tries to mass deport people, it'll tank the economy pretty quickly. The stimulus check idea would be funny tho. I think him being in the spotlight again and his deterioration being highlight more prominently will get a lot of people to sour on him. He managed to sink to 30% approval while riding off of Obama's economy.",
         "idk, we'll see. He's broken into the 30s before.",
         "I will never trust my gut on anything political ever again.",
         "Donald Trump is a convicted felon, twice impeached, raped kids with Epstein, and sold nuclear secrets to the Saudis, and he just won reelection.\n\nJD Vance can also win, thinking these things can't happen and letting our guard down is why they keep winning.",
         "Oh don't worry.\n\nYou might think Americans can't disappoint you any worse, but they see that as a challenge.",
         "So it would be Vance RFK and musk running the show. Wonderful",
         "Make it national",
         "NZ and even Australia don\u2019t do that well when it comes to multiculturalism and diversity though. Immigration is mainly from China and recently India. From my limited understanding of Oceanian, I don\u2019t really see conservative minorities voting for the Liberals (AU) or Nationals (NZ) like they\u2019re doing in the UK or the US\n\nThey\u2019re also really small, isolated and insignificant\n\nAlso you will literally freeze to death in Australia",
         "Canada is buckling under the strain of unplanned mass immigration, slow economic growth and a severe housing shortage. I expect Trudeau and his party are going to swept away by a Trump-esque wave come next year.",
         "By \u201cup there\u201d, do you mean literally? As in on the map?",
         "Yeah, I'm with you. Anyone who saw J6, much less anything else Trump did, and still voted for him is irredeemable. If we continue to have free and fair elections then Dems will win again, but I will never see this country the same way after this morning. You could chalk 2016 to any number of factors, but in 2024 the message is clear: voters want Trump and everything that comes with him.",
         ">They support authoritarianism\n\nbro like just a slight majority of brits support authoritarian things like allowing the government to read your whatsapp messages it\u2019s a global issue and blue america is actually one of the most liberal places on earth",

         "No because they\u2019re gonna come *here*.",
         "Still entirely too high lmao, but good point",
         "Agreed. My gut kept telling me Harris would pull through and win Michigan and Arizona, and now not one of those is happening. Who can you trust if you can't even trust yourself lol.",
         "Yeah and that\u2019s a big IF. It\u2019s likely there could be no institution that insure that happens after this election.",
         "Build the wall.",
         "Fortunately we have a decentralized election system that relies heavily on individual states, and many of the states that voted for Trump tonight have Democratic administrations that will continue through 2026, where they stand to gain."

         "* Dem state and local level governance has been bad. SF, Chicago, etc haven\u2019t been good at delivering for their residents or spending efficiently, and voters nationwide punished Dems for their regional failures. \n\n* Dems have spent/prioritized groups without a worthwhile payoff. There\u2019s been hundreds of billions spent bailing out union pensions, primarily benefiting old white retired former union workers- often ones with rich pensions. These voters have taken Dem money and shifted to Trump. \n\n* Dem policy for decades seemed to be built around \u201clet\u2019s do ____ good thing in a way that creates lots of jobs\u201d. This isn\u2019t a fit for 2024- and left behind a cancer of inefficiencies. Dems need to reinvent to \u201clet\u2019s do ____ good thing in an efficient low cost way- so we can get the most bang for our buck\u201d. This is in conflict with unions/local non for profits- but it\u2019s a big reason why it\u2019s so much more expensive to live in Dem states. \n\n* It hurts me deeply- but the Biden plan to lift up the bottom quadrant of wages through full employment failed. It led to inflation- which is politically toxic. Next time in a crisis - the horrible choice has to be mass unemployment and limited stimulus. \n\n* Dems screwed up by having so much of the infrastructure projects get bogged down in years of environmental review and paperwork. Now- Republicans will get credit for the work. \n\n* Dems failed to limit the flow of asylum seekers- and it was an unpopular disaster. This was made worse by Dem states and cities not having the capability to handle migrant influx without grifting/super inefficient spending. \n\n* Biden\u2019s late exit put Kamala in a tough position. \n\n* Millennial generation seemed to have the 2007 crash as their formative political moment- and blames Republicans for it. Gen Z is different, and seems much more open to Republicans. \n\n* Abortion referendums ran ahead of Dems pretty universally. Dems didn\u2019t seem to be able to tie Trump or other Republicans candidates to abortion policy. \n\n* Some of the story is just a global anti-incumbent wave\u2026. But Trump was the opponent. It goes beyond that. \n\n* The old media is dead. Trump and Musk figured out how to connect with voters through new media. Kamala didn\u2019t.\n\n* This might be me being petty/angry- but I think a lot of left-ish influencers had the best years of their life 2016-2020 when \u201cresistance\u201d money was flowing in for podcasts/donations.

Jewish voters have seen Jewish students physically assaulted at progressive-coded institutions, and while Biden, Harris, etc, condemned the protests, the assailants were treated with kid gloves and allowed to keep coming back. Jewish voters felt unsafe and started voting for the party that would actually do something about it. Meanwhile, the protesters said up front they don't consider themselves Democrats and weren't going to vote. Besides basic civil liberties, sticking up for the voters that have consistently shown up for you in the past is basic politics. A big tent is great, but certain groups just don't get along and you'll piss them both off for trying to thread the needle.\n\n2) People don't like feeling punished when they haven't done anything wrong. Most people don't shoplift, and they're tired of waiting for a clerk with a key just to get some deodorant because shoplifters are too tolerated. Families of immigrants that came here \"the right way\" and have a story of adversity don't like seeing someone else cut the line. Most people don't do drugs, and parents especially don't like missing parks because public spaces are full of used needles.\n\n3) Democrats/Progressives (of which I consider myself one btw) take certain things as a given. Some houses are being built, what if we just add zoning red tape, neighborhood character requirements, etc? The houses will still be built right? Or, we know there's a bunch of money coming from the federal government for green energy right? It's GOING to happen, so what's the harm in that extra environmental review because some unelected neighborhood association wants to feel important? Or, were going to require something be built with all-US parts and all-union labor, damn the costs and timelines. But all these extra requirements add up, the project costs balloon, housing prices go up from lack of supply, and voters see a big price tag without anything to show for it.\n\nNone of these I personally blame on Biden, Harris, or other federal candidates, because they're happening in multiple communities across the country.

Race and identity based politics is divisive in the best of times, there\u2019s a reason why AA failed in deep blue CA. In fact, it\u2019s probably the single least popular policy that the Dems support.

She has a long history of electoral underperformance, and both ran away from her own previous positions and the Biden admin's record while failing to meaningfully differentiate herself from Biden.",
         "I may write a whole post on this later. But the good news for Democrats is that this election was *always* going to be an uphill battle, and while Kamala Harris actually proved to have surprisingly good political instincts, she personally is a pretty weak candidate. So you can plausibly expect that a better candidate in a more favorable climate would be able to win. Biden's tenure has been awful, and him running for so long, I think, meant a lot of voters came to terms with voting for Trump back in early-mid 2024 before Harris took over [I mean, look at the search results for \"did Joe Biden drop out\"...]. The barrier was gone after that. \n\n\nThe bad [well, if you're a D operative/partisan] news is that it's clear that the GOP's new economically populist, socially conservative agenda is in fact able to win large numbers of Latino and Black voters, as well as young voters. Consider this a categorical rejection of Bidenism at the polls. In addition, Harris' strategy to try to gain more conservative/moderate leaning suburbanites largely fizzled. I think we can place the blame here on first, the fact that Harris never really committed to any conservative policies, and second, that Biden's tenure obviated a lot of good-faith that suburban white voters had in Biden to \"restore normalcy\". \n\n\nBasically there's two paths forward, but imo really only one path. The first is to abandon social progressivism and max out economic populism--the Bernie Sanders path, but with more Black/Latino appeal. The problem is, this is what the GOP is *already* doing, and they're better at it. Biden and Harris have both tried this path, Biden squeaked over the edge and Harris flopped hard. I see no reason why a future left-populist candidate would see any more success. \n\n\nThe second is to see the path forward in the white suburbs [and multiracial suburbs]. These voters are *reliable*, they're very high quality in terms of showing up to the polls, but they aren't entirely comfortable with the current Democratic agenda. So mold the agenda to fit them, along with college educated voters that increasingly make up the base of the party. I'd say that the future Democratic Party should place at its three corners social liberals/left libertarians, fiscal conservatism, and liberal internationalism. A bit like a liberal version of the old GOP. Basically:\n\n1. the \"I want gay married couples to own AR-15s on their private weed farm\" vote\n\n2. the \"my god I hate inflation and tariffs\" vote\n\n3. the \"I don't trust the GOP internationally\" vote\n\n\nCorresponding with these three, Dems should realign their messaging. Slam Trump's tariffs [get people to put Trump \"I did this\" stickers on tarriffed goods]. Pummel him on inflation and deficits. Hit him for restrictions on social issues, while saying you just want people to be free to do what they want (in the privacy of their own homes--try not to associate too much with big, open public displays, it's offputting to normie voters).  Maintain a *strong* line internationally that doesn't waffle about, try to out-muscleman Trump and support defense spending *and* diplomacy--go full Scoop Jackson. \n\n\n\nThat's in addition to some of the stuff other commenters are mentioning, like focusing more on reform and administrative improvements--govern *smarter*, not *harder*. I also think Democrats should work to literally *change the language* they use to be flashier, more provocative, and antagonistic--part of Trump's appeal is that he \"tells it like it is\". It'll also help with the male vote if your talk about \"bringing America together\" is followed by \"to sit upon a throne of the skulls of our enemies\".",

         "A)dont do anything that could influence increasing inflation\n\nB)recognize how repellant lefty culture war is to working class people. Recognize that being seen as the hall monitors and HR ladies is revolting to huge swathes of the electorate, especially working class men.\n\nC)recognize that the biggest and most prominent uniformly blue states struggling at the basics (homelessness, shoplifting) is really bad for the national party\n\nD)don't ever ever try to hoodwink the electorate again, like was done with Bidens cognitive decline. We are an increasingly low trust society. Trump has exploited this wherever possible, and where he has baggage he just does it in the open and owns it, so it almost \"cleanses\" him. It can't be nefarious if he said it on tv, right?\n\nE)don't try to appeal to people's better angels. The electorate saw trump encourage a deadly riot, and ignore helping when he could. I'm not saying Dems should also do this (you shouldn't do it because it is wrong) but don't expect the same attitudes around liberal democracy from the electorate as a whole. It's just empirically true - they didn't care enough for it to matter. Do it because it's good, don't expect it to win.\n\nI honestly don't know if that is enough to be honest. Republicans had the baggage of abortion, and it just didn't matter. Election autopsies are hard. Perhaps trump is a unique candidate that can't be replicated, I just do not know.

And unfortunately, these progressives sure seem to have an outsized impact on setting the (perceived, at least) tone for the national democrats. They just cannot fathom that the vast majority of the country simply does not want their brand of in-your-face progressivism and the \"MONOCAUSE\".\n\nThey are fine with gay marriage and trans people \"existing\".

         "Ok, first of all any talk about the Democratic Party having no future is absurd, as it is when it\u2019s the other way round and people are casually predicting the destruction of the Republican Party. Nothing is static, many many voters are captured temporarily and not permanently, and any assumptions about why they voted a certain way and continue to vote that way are misguided and over-generalising.\n\nFirst, on the Republican Party. Donald Trump is unique and unconventional, which has been incredibly beneficial to him but carries a risk when it comes to finding his successor. Republicans right now will understandably be very optimistic about the future of their party, but no matter what they think there is no concrete way for them to retain the \u2018Trump formula\u2019 in future elections. It\u2019s entirely possible that they find someone who can take over that mantle, it\u2019s also entirely possible that that person pisses their voter coalition away because they don\u2019t have the very particular type of appeal that Trump has, and aren\u2019t able to get away with the same unorthodoxies. I am not yet convinced that he has created a lasting movement.\n\nSecond, on the Democratic Party. There are multiple problems here that people have already touched on: elitism, arrogance, populism, being tied to the far left, communication etc. I want to touch on authenticity.\n\nTrump\u2019s communication is authentic. It\u2019s dishonest, but it\u2019s authentic. When you go to his rallies, watch his interviews, or read his tweets you are getting something that it is totally his own, and unique to that situation. It\u2019s messy and deranged, but it\u2019s also unfiltered and improvised. He does not have a \u2018stump speech\u2019, he has talking points but that\u2019s the extent of\nIt. Democrats are stuck in this old idea of message discipline that no longer applies, in part because Trump contrasts so heavily with that strategy that the constant repetitions and evasions become even more noticeable.\n\nKamala Harris had a major authenticity problem because she:\n\n* Avoided difficult interviews\n\n* Evaded difficult questions\n\n* Wasn\u2019t able to seamlessly segue from an uncomfortable topic into one of her talking points (See Pete Buttigieg for examples of doing this effectively).\n\n* Failed to recognise the value of non-traditional media - podcasts are how increasing numbers of people and especially young people consume information. I don\u2019t think her going on Joe Rogan would have changed the result, but ffs it\u2019s the most popular podcast in the country, with an audience that is there to be won. How can you not recognise the value in appearing on that sort of media? Additionally, you cannot leave social media to some marketing intern posting the same repetitive, boring stump speech clip from one of your rallies. No, the majority of people are not using Twitter or listening to Joe Rogan, but everyone knows people who do - you need to reach those people to control the entire online information highway (which includes work/friend/family group chats btw). Candidates need to be able to use Twitter authentically themselves, without focus grouping every bloody tweet.\n\n* Avoided the primary process (not her fault). Obama and Trump were able to come in and take control of their parties and the narrative. Harris was unable to do this, and so the election became Trump VS an avatar of the Democratic Party.",
         "They definitely had a bunch of options.

Losing the Latino vote at all is unacceptable, especially after Trump's rally, and she did so poorly, Miami-Dade is now red. All the money sent in to her, and none of it mattered. And, why it is that we fail to understand time and time again that money and immigration motivate people better than any other issues, and therefore we need to do a much better job of selling our economic record?

Now, will that hold true for the actual governing? Maybe not, but it's what the electorate actually voted for.\n\nAssuming democracy holds, this isn't a death knell for liberalism.

Appearing \u201ctough on crime\u201d probably would help polling. This doesn\u2019t mean abandoning criminal justice reform outright, but there needs to be more of an appearance of being \u201ctough on crime\u201d. In many measurable ways, crime has dropped, but stores are locking up more products due to shoplifting and people feel unsafe due to vibes. This is a perception issue!\n\nWave the flag and give off those patriotic vibes. Stop with the identity politics that normies are fatigued with such as X nationality/gender for Y.

This doesn\u2019t mean to leave struggling students behind, but recognize that all parents want opportunities for their kids.

From the *bottom* up.\n\nMaybe that's a step way too far, but /rant.\n\nAlternatively we maybe really should strongly consider trying to reform US elections (again, *locally* /  from the bottom up), and make real *attempts* to challenge and throw out the US 2-party system, and in particular the hyper-fixation on *national* level politics.\n\nBear in mind that we are in this situation *in the first place* because Trump *is* the only real (and credible) challenger to US establishment dem leadership.\n\nWhich is a massive f---ing problem given that US electoral politics tends to very reliably yo-yo between / against establishment / incumbent party leadership, and Trump is a populist wanna-be authoritarian - maybe - who has taken over one of the US's only two major parties.\n\nAnd ergo if you *do* have major beef with national-level dem leadership, you may very well end up voting *for that* for a change / rebellion against the current status quo. As we have very self evidently seen in this election. And dems - or more accurately center-left to far-left US media - tend to very regularly have their heads stuck up their own asses on a few issues, which is more or less at least *part* of how we've ended up in this particular situation / completely fucked election *(and trajectory over the past 10 years)* in the first place.\n\nIn general dems need to take a *really* hard look in the mirror, given that 1) HRC lost to trump in 2016, 2) Biden ran, and literally only won in 2020 due to a) trump, b) *generally* very strongly positive memories of biden as Obama's VP, and a desire to return to that point and style of leadership. Since then we have somehow completely 3) stopped talking about healthcare reform / public option, despite the ACA since becoming a massive (albeit very stopgap) public success, *and* how critical bloated healthcare (and in addition to that housing costs) are to US COL problems, wage gaps, *and* something that adds a massive and very (globally) inefficient burden to US businesses, and helps make US labor *even less* cost effective within certain industries.\n\nOh, and instead of *that* we had somehow apparently, in our infinite wisdom, turned the 2024 election entirely *into purely reactive issues against trump / republicans*, including abortion, 24/7 year-round coverage of the trump criminal proceedings and investigations, and so on and so forth. Oh, and initial stances on immigration + policing, that were 1) anti-trump, 2) blew up in our faces given a) the worldwide (and particularly in eg. europe) pivot away from support for liberal open-borders immigration. And b) the fact that crime, in general, *is* bad, and above all tends to actually affect ethnic minorities, and other groups of people that dems / progressives are *supposedly* fighting for.",

Non-college-educated minority voters are now behaving like non-college-educated White voters. Those people have \\*always\\* been socially conservative, except for their opposition to racism. America has become less racist in the last 16 years (despite perhaps becoming more xenophobic), so opposition to racism no longer overrides other concerns for those non-college-educated racial minority voters.\n\nThere's no way the Democrats are going to abandon socially progressive policy, and shouldn't.

Trump is a really good campaigner and always has been. He can convince lots of people that he's on their side. He can mobilize huge numbers of people who don't normally vote. He has succeeded in growing the tent more than other Republican politicians by making huge inroads with Hispanics, union workers, the working and middle class, even urban voters in some areas. But that also makes the reality of governing very difficult, which is why his support once in office falters. It's quite similar to Obama.\n\nI think Democrats also need to do some soul searching on how they approach gender/racial/generational politics.

         ">but like how the fuck does san Francisco have a homeless problem when California is the richest state in the country?\n\n\\*ahem\\*\n\nIt is because land values are great for the individual but a blight on society. When high paying jobs come in, land values absorb some of that growth, pushing values up. This is important because land in cities is finite and it's non-fungible. You can't take a square foot from rural Texas and drop it in San Francisco. In addition, we've largely stopped building new housing and what is built has a limit on density. The net result is that we've said b each person should have X sqft of land area in a place with extremely expensive per-sqft land values.\n\nThis plays into homelessness because there's much more demand for housing than supply and supply isn't increasing. There are just mathematically more people than houses. Some will have to go without. If you can't come up with the very expensive rents, you don't get to have a home. You live on someone's couch or in your car.\n\nThere is a comic by Alfred Twu that I think aptly summarizes the situation:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qgfyyh0alazd1.jpeg?width=3803&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6d2e418e95a9dab8e2137c51f1347492900de24c",

It's not that simple. \n\nIf anything, I think there's a **resentment** that California (as an example) is doing well when the other states aren't. People in West Virginia are clearly not thinking \"oh \nCalifornia has a **three times lower drug overdose death rate** than we do. Their policies must work \", they're just angry that the government has failed them so badly and are using their vote to lash out. People aren't reading Brookings Institute, they're going to their last child's funeral.\n\nWhen a politician says \"our policies work\" it actually makes them angrier because it's **not** working for them even though the policies are in fact working in the places they're actually being implemented. This is why Trump whose policies measurably hurt rural communities is able to reach them with the language of resentment and why the optimism of Harris and to some degree Clinton was such a massive turn-off.\n\nIf Democrats continue to think telling people how they can make their lives better will win elections, they will continue to lose.",

It was a hail Mary and all of our polling/data hinted at a tight race but Kamala outperforming Joe. It was all terribly wrong.\n\nThe only silver lining is that stronger national democrats are left untouched by this election cycle for a shot in 2028. \n\nAs for the question where it all went wrong you've either got 2000 or 2016.

Their take is that Harris and the democrats offered nothing of value while Trump managed to understand what people were angry about.

You have to create a narrative that hope is needed- not just hope that the other guy doesn\u2019t get elected. The message that the country needs to get better runs contrary to the fact that you\u2019ve held the office for the past four years. It wasn\u2019t, look what we\u2019ve done and we\u2019ll do more of the same. I think that this part of the message needed to overpower their narrative.

Also, a ton of policy is made at state and local level (states all over have been cutting taxes), not just the White House, it's dishonest to blame Democrats solely for pumping some money into the economy after a shock of unprecedented shot-term scale in 2020, especially when Trump also approved and passed such legislation.\n\nThere are certainly real faults with Democrats on this election, but I'm afraid the thing about inflation is more a result of right-wing media successfully pushing this as some kind of unprecedented hyperinflation and conveniently focusing on 2019 prices vs now without looking at wage increases in the same timescale.\n\nSo yes, it's more about vibes than reality, and the reasons of the votes for Trump should be looked at mostly everywhere else.",

         "I'm afraid that most issues are noise, the big one that will always move the needle has been and always will be the economy. People finding it hard to afford the things they are used to having is a potential political disaster for whoever is in charge and it shouldn't be minimised. Inflation completely sank Biden's re-election chances even before it was obvious his brain had turned into soup. Harris has been left holding the bag to an extent as the bad vibes economically had already set in regardless of the fundamentals all looking great. We really do live in the age of vibes to an extent.\n\nThe worst thing is, the Biden admin did an objectively great job riding out the economic malaise he had to govern through, from covid and the hangover from all that spending, the rampant inflation fuelled by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the mess that I/P has descended into with the Houthis trying to grind maritime shipping to a halt in the region. Look at how anaemic and stagnant the major European economies are for an example of how much worse it could be. He and his team should genuinely be commended, their legacy will be similar to Obama's in that is that the US economy is in a good enough position to potentially weather another Trump presidency that tries its best to run it into the ground with tariffs and general instability and uncertainty both at home and abroad.\n\nTrump's whole image is that he's the money guy and he just happened to govern in the only time of decent economic growth and stability of the post '08 age. His literal name and signature was also on the stimmy cheques, if you're an economic illiterate (aka a super-majority of people, not only Americans) he's the only guy who ever threw you a bone. Biden and Harris were in charge when you suddenly couldn't afford your private taxi for your burrito anymore.\n\nAlso doesn't help that the only other issues people are moved to vote on is immigration, which is such a lightning rod for people's rage. I think that the democrats should have learned this lesson from looking at their European allies getting trounced for the past near-decade by now. Both the proles and bougie suburban types want less of it and want a big strong leader who is willing and happy to stamp the jackboot on the necks of the brown and black people if it means they don't have to see as many of them in their neighbourhoods, end of story. Appealing to people's humanity is a waste of time, they don't see these people as people for the most part.  They want the democrats to lace up and get stomping and they see the pro-immigration crowd as hopelessly naive and aloof to the issues around immigration at best, actively harming the country at their neighbourhood's expense at the behest of some other external power at worst. The Biden admin should have never lifted Trump's policies at the border as it literally did lead to a surge in crossings, even if numbers are back under control now. Such a stupid own-goal on behalf of people who were going to vote for you anyways.\n\nHowever, in this case I really think it's as simple as bad vibes due to inflation. The Democrats really need to get better PR and messaging when it comes to economic policy. They literally are the better economic managers but the average Joe is convinced they aren't. That is the biggest problem and most urgent issue. Sack all the useless professional-managerial class failchildren in the marketing and comms teams please. It is literally essential for global stability that these people shunned from decision making.",

No matter how well a democratic system is crafted, it can't survive if it does not have the confidence of the people.\nTrump wants massive tariffs, day one dictatorship and to remove those who 'poison' the blood of the country; and he's been given a democratic mandate to do all of these things.\nI won't lie, I am dooming so hard right now, but I guess I'm writing this to say (and to convince myself) that it's pointless, and the only thing which matters is what happens going forwards. \nTrump, being out of power, has been allowed to spew this rhetoric without consequence, and without voters understanding what he really entails. But they will get understand soon, when they see inflation skyrocket and the government descend into chaos; and so it'll be up those who still oppose Trump to shift the narrative back from where he moved it 8 years ago; back towards progress and liberalism and free trade, because everyone will experience what it's like in their absence. The majority of Trump voters aren't committed fascists, they genuinely believe he will make their lives better, so when he doesn't, we need to make them understand why. And then maybe, there'll be big enough majorities give the constitution some very needed reforms.\nAmerica has had it very good for a long time, and maybe that's made people complacent, because it can happen here as it can happen anywhere. Democracy faces a real trial here, but I think that's the nature of democratic systems; they only survive by constant, concerted effort; no one ever said fighting for freedom was easy.
