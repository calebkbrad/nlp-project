         "From [here](https://www.ft.com/content/e8ac09ea-c300-4249-af7d-109003afb893) - I increasingly buy the idea that the Democrats were facing a really uphill battle this year and there wasn't a whole lot they could have done that would have swung the outcome. Maybe having a candidate not directly tied to the Biden administration would have helped, but I think people would still have treated them as the incumbent party.\n\nI realise that this might be cope.",
         "Everyone wants some grand conspiracy but I think it\u2019s literally just inflation. \n\nJust sucks that it\u2019s under control now and that he can take credit",
         "In some ways this is comforting.  The after-election analyses have theories getting thrown around wildly about how democrats can perform better next cycle.  I've seen a ton of suggestions that we're just in a more conservative period in US politics and democrats should just shift further right to compensate.  I've seen people suggest abandoning gay marriage as a topic. ???  It has 70%+ support, wtf are you talking about??\n\nThis might be wishful thinking, but to me this is just a terrible cycle to be an incumbent party.  Inflation sucks ass and whoever is the sitting party is getting blamed for it.\n\nThere's some self-reflection here that's good, but I really think Conservatives in the US are gonna overplay their hand in the next 2 years and get burned when grocery prices don't magically go back to 2019 levels.  Their policies in general aren't remotely popular, so they're either gonna do nothing and hope they remain popular, or roll out toxic policies in the hopes they can utilize enough propaganda to make them popular.",
         "I know every man and his dog has an opinion on this election, but I think fundamentally it comes down to two things on the liberal side. First of all, inflation is political poison for incumbents and a loss for the Democrats was probably inevitable; in keeping with trends we have seen all across the democratic world. However, just because this election was decided by inflation does not mean that we are also seeing significant voter dissatisfaction with the Democrat party. The hemorrhaging of votes in deep blue states and urban areas points to Democrat mismanagement in how those areas are run. The gender divide and the particular loss of Latino voters points to a deep cultural disconnect with voters.",
         "It's a little bit sobering to realize that ultimately, a lot of the times the strength of a candidate, the campaign, the ground game, none of that matters if the cosmic dice roll comes up snake eyes. There's a lot less that we can do to influence elections than we think, sometimes it's literally just uncontrollable circumstance.\n\nMakes me a feel a bit apathetic and fatalist tbh. Maybe this is ALWAYS how it was gonna play out.",
         "Before people huff too much copium here: what this means is that the central banks have \"learned\" that crashing an economy is better than permitting any kind of noticeable inflation. You better hope that you're not going to be the one that loses their job next time around thanks to people demonstrating that they're entirely lacking in empathy and would prefer literal \"beggar thy neighbor\" policies to bearing any kind of shared social burden.",
         "There really is a mess going on with liberal democracies, isn't there?\n\nI dearly hope this passes, but... Well, I fear it won't without some sort of catastrophe showing people why being an apathetic cynic who votes against more than for anything is a bad idea.",

         "In the current media environment it seems that being the incumbency candidate/party is a major disadvantage when it once was seen as a plus. Every governing administration has a million eyeballs and 2 millions ears directed at them, and every single mistake, flubbed speech, or piece of bad news is published and spread around the internet immediately. \n\nOne of my other thoughts on this is what it means for longer term initiatives in the future. We all know that one of the genuine benefits of a dictatorship or one-part state is that they don't have to worry about losing an election and can take their time fostering plans that could take a decade to roll out. What will it mean for the effectiveness of governments if it's basically assumed that you will only have one term in office?",

As I write, they are ahead in Nevada + Arizona, and only 0.4% behind in Pennsylvania.\n\nIf you had a presidential candidate outperforming the senate races by 0.4%, Democrats would have won the presidency 287 to 251. And that's not counting Georgia (no high-profile statewide race) and NC (the governor race is an outlier).\n\nInstead, the presidential candidate underperformed those senate races by an average of 2.8 (Nevada 2.9, Arizona 7, Wisconsin 1.8, Michigan 1.8, Pennsylvania 0.6).\n\nHarris was a better candidate than Biden, but I do think she was a worse candidate than almost any senator/governor from a purplish state. (mostly because of her association with an unpopular administration)",

         "Kamala should have held one of those kangaroo court trials for Biden declaring him guilty of Bidenflation and then executed him on live TV, I feel like that may have barely been enough",
         "Biden threw it as soon as he decided to run for re-election. Historically unpopular president with record inflation and he decided the best thing to do is run a victory lap on the economy. Bidenomics was on every attack ad that wasnt about immigrants/trans people and is still the worst politicing i have seen in my lifetime.\n\nWith how close it was i really think someone from outside his administration could have comfortably swung it. Theres a lot of reckoning that needs to happen in the dem party, but how disconnected leadership is and how they were so in line with biden needs to be a part of it.",
         "Obvious hindsight but it seems like the 2 pre-reqs to win as a dem for the presidency would be to \n\n1. Be completely separate to the Biden admin\n2. Openly trash and get into fights with the admin\n\nKamala is obviously unable to do both and while she ran a good campaign she should\u2019ve not accepted the nomination.",
         "It's definitely a factor though in addition to economics (a huge hurdle), the Dems just don't seem to have that big of a bloc anymore.",
         "Democrats were a balance to republicans, a sort of crappy one, but it was what it was, now they are a balance to a Republican Party that no longer exists. Populism took over the nation, the GOP harnessed it, whereas democrats rejected it outright in 2016. As a result, it looks like neo-reactionism won, not just this election but overall.",

         "Until his tarrifs and the economic policy ideas make it worse",
         "I dont think it's a conspiracy to add in people's perception of their world is shaped differently now too.  We're seeking out media that tells us things aren't good.  It's not the whole story but it definitely plays a part.\n\nIt played a part in why Trump lost in 2020 too.",
         "Closing down all the widget factories was deeply unpopular. Please do not pay people to stay home. Please. Please do not do that again.",
         "My real problem with Trump's agenda for the next few years is that I have no idea how to calibrate my expectations. Best thing for them politically would be to deport a few people, introduce some finely calibrated tariffs, and change absolutely nothing about Biden's industrial policy. The economy would keep humming along and he could go into the mid-terms with a huge successful message without ever doing very much. But the people around him now are true believers and may actually go down the mass deportation and blanket tariff route, which would be economically and politically disastrous. If he goes down that route, are they nimble enough to walk it back before the impact damages their political future?",
         "I think it basically comes down to how much Republicans fuck up a free lunch. If they just leave things alone they'll ride a red-hot economy to Reagan levels of support. Alternatively they fuck things up with tariffs and their usual nonsense and we continue with the cycle of Republicans blowing up the economy and Democrats fixing it.",
         "Ill continue to scream that if life keeps getting worse in saphire blue areas the dems will never recover. Local and state demd have heralded in exploding housing prices while abandoning things like transit and ignoring issues from homelessness because its politcally inconvenient.\n\nIf dems at the federal level dont start screaming at state and local leaders to cut the bullshit the bleeding is only going to get worse. And it should",
         ">First of all, inflation is political poison for incumbents and a loss for the Democrats was probably inevitable\n\nI'm really trying to wrack my brain around how the Democrats did so much better than expected in 2022, even after inflation had been raging for a year at that point. Was the fresh sting from the Dobbs decision a motivating factor for so many people? Were people much more disenchanted by inflation by 2024 because it had become more entrenched by that point? It's going to be an interest next few months as these analyses unfold.",
         "I really think it just comes down to three things:\n\n- Inflation\n- Building more housing\n- Woke-scolding\n\nInflation was baked in and was handled better in the US as anywhere else, so there's not much that could have been done better. But the messaging was bad, i.e. instead of tauting massive investments they should have started by going all in on messaging that they were focused on driving inflation down and only when it was truly coming down hyped up any spending measures such as the IRA and Chips act. As it was the Republicans were able to characterize them as big spenders who made inflation worse, which isn't supported by the data but lost them the messaging battle.\n\nDemocrats needed to go hard-core YIMBY and crush all local opposition towards zoning  reform, if they'd done that in 2020 maybe we'd have had some actual success stories in Blue states by the time election came around.\n\nI honestly don't give a shit about the woke stuff, it just doesn't have any meaningful impact on my life but post-2020 it was pretty clear that Democrats should have distanced themselves and just taken the pragmatic position of \"we support whatever lifestyle you have but policing language is silly\" and we're the common sense live and let live party.",
         "Honestly, I think those two things are deeply related.\n\nPeople are upset about inflation. Democrats message on inflation has not been \"we'll fix it\", but \"inflation is fine, actually\". \n\nThe Democratic party appeals to more educated voters, and they know it. And because they know it, they have a tendency to view themselves as the more intelligent party. Republicans are stupid. Saying they'll fix inflation is factually incorrect. etc. There's an \"I know better than you\" kind of attitude that's, frankly, grating. Maybe being the smartest people in the room works in a meritocracy, but not in a democracy.\n\nThe average person doesn't care that inflation is actually going down. They're not using it as a technical term. They care that prices are high, they want prices to be low. Telling people that they're wrong about feeling that way isn't smart, it's just unempathetic. Rather than using that education to figure out a way to creatively meet voter's felt needs without compromising actual needs, the party has opted to just dismiss that view as stupid and ignore it.",
         "IMO conflating Trump appeal to \"dissatisfaction with the democratic party\" is not the right take, those are fundamentally different concepts.",
         "It\u2019s only uncontrollable at the last minute, in the long run, this is by design. The republicans have been dismantling public education to keep the population more vulnerable to this for decades. It\u2019s an investment that will pay them dividends for years to come. Some of this kind of backlash is uncontrollable, but a meaningful amount can be controlled and the republicans have proven it time and time again. It\u2019s certainly asymmetrical and easier to keep people misinformed than educated, but education is certainly an effective antidote to this poison.",

Gov., the AG, the Superintendent, and knocked the state lege out of a GOP supermajority. It's a huge part of my own reasoning that the GOP didn't really win this race, Trump just has a personality cult (see also: 2022).",

Why, then, did the entire country shift right relative to 2020, with only the swing states shifting less overall? \n\nThis was always going to be very tough. Harris simply didn't have the time to campaign for long enough to win this election. Even if she, or another Democrat, did, I doubt it would have improved much. Maybe grabbed another swing state. Lots of people will split the ticket, voting one party for president and the other for Senate/House with the idea that the legislature will restrain the President, or that the President will restrain the legislature.",

They don\u2019t give a shit about the down ballot. When you drill down into the numbers, you see that there are just more votes for Trump than any of the down ballots in respective races. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll ever see that with another Republican candidate.",

         " Because Trump wasn\u2019t on the ballot. It may not seem like it on the surface, but outside of Trump, the GOP is not a fundamentally strong party and its backbench is very shallow. The fact that a Republican candidate just won the popular vote for the first time in 20 years, yet we\u2019re not even sure if they\u2019ve won the house, says a lot. A better organized and better led Republican Party puts up Regan numbers in this kind of environment",
         "That's easy. Dems didn't do so much better than expected in 2022. The media invented a narrative backed by nothing that there would be a red wave. That election was exactly what polling said it would be.",
         "Americans were just plain neutral on trans rights up until the evangelical right invented trans bathroom panic as a wedge issue to replace gay marriage. The problem with conceding on human rights issues that are being cynically used to manipulate public opinion is that bad actors will keep A/B testing new hate narratives until they find one that resonates with enough of the public\n\nAnd, unlike the right, the online left doesn\u2019t take marching orders from their party. WTF is the Democratic Party supposed to do about \u201cwoke-scolding\u201d coming from individuals in the public acting on their beliefs?\n\nOrb\u00e1nism has proven the effectiveness of oligarchical control of the media combined with a rotating list of targeted \u201cenemy\u201d classes. There\u2019s every reason to believe that Republicans have also learned from this strategy",
         "And immigration",
         "Yup, our messaging is terrible despite the headwinds.\n\n1.) We needed to communicate that 2022-2024 was a post-Covid recovery. Biden's stimulus did a great job at helping us avoid the recession that happened in other parts of the world, but voters still saw it as a failure. I don't know why, but the entire \"recovering from a global pandemic\" thing was basically memory-holed across the entire US. We allowed the narrative to be \"Biden created record inflation and ruined everything\" without emphasizing what Biden's policies were an explicit response to. \n\n2.) This is entirely the fault of Democrats. Our messaging where we defend California sounds almost exactly like how we campaigned on the US economy: \"You say California is unlivable, but look at the GDP!\" If people can't afford rent, GDP going up is irrelevant to them and we absolutely cannot campaign on how good the economy is. Places like Florida and Texas actually build housing.\n\n3.) This is huge and I can't really overstate how much things like this hurt us with young men. Weird example, but a Dragon Age game came out before the election and I know multiple guys that saw it as the perfect example of why they now hate the Democrats. The game has a bunch of scenes where it basically lectures the player on gender, when Dragon Age used to be a somewhat edgy RPG franchise. This type of thing, writ large, has absolutely destroyed the image of the party for essentially no reason. The Democrats need to embrace the personal freedoms angle to advance LGBT rights while also not feeling the need to lecture people on everything. If guys want to enjoy guns or make games with hot people in them, we absolutely can't be the party of \"well actually, here's why everything you like is problematic and needs to be banned or censored.\" Because that's our image right now.",
         "> so there's not much that could have been done better. \n\nWhat nonsense is that? Biden came into offense and immediately did a bunch of inflationary things while inflation was roaring. Doing better than places that had far worse inflationary pressures doesn't mean you did things well. Everybody saw ARP after vaccination was literal days away for the obvious one, but he was pretty clearly drinking the MMT cool aid in general.\n\nAnd that's without going into the much harder question of \"did anybody actually handle covid properly\" and just assuming that no matter what there was going to be hard inflation.",
         "> Inflation was baked in and was handled better in the US as anywhere else\n\n2% a year is baked in.  What we got in the last 4 years, that's the result of bad policy.  And what we're seeing in this post is that yes it is global and yes parties around the world are being punished for their involvement, too.  The bad policies that caused it were global, they were implemented all around the world.  Hence the unprecedented global punishment of incumbents.\n\n> I honestly don't give a shit about the woke stuff\n\nYou don't, but a lot of other people do.  IMO the expression \"politics is downstream from culture\" is about the most astute political observation of the last 20 years.  Yeah it came from the shittiest of people but that doesn't make it a bad observation.  Until the Democrats get back on board with the culture of non-New-England/West-Coast America the election map will probably look like it did Tuesday night where they win very little outside of New England and the West Coast.",

         "I agree with this article wholeheartedly. I think there were ways Kamala and particularly Biden could have improved our margins (particularly with immigration). But at the end of the day whether you\u2019re a left leaning party, right leaning party or centrist, if you\u2019ve been the incumbent the last few years you\u2019ve been fucked.\n\nI think that Kamala did the best she could and this ironically shows in the results where despite the strong headwinds the GOP didn\u2019t flip any states beyond the big seven (and in hindsight a stronger candidate could very well have flipped bastions like Virginia and Minnesota), the House margins will be single digits and the GOP Senate margin is looking to be 53-54. Still bad don\u2019t get me wrong, but imagine how bad it would have been if Biden stayed in or a more moderate GOP member was the nominee",
         "Article:\n\n\nAt the time of writing, vice-president Kamala Harris has won almost four percentage points less of the popular vote than President Joe Biden did in 2020, the steepest drop in Democratic support since 1980. What\u2019s more, not only did Donald Trump retake the White House, the Republicans won a majority in the Senate and are likely to retain control of the House of Representatives.\n\n\nSuch a crushing defeat in this week\u2019s US election is bound to elicit months if not years of soul-searching from Democrats. Did Biden hold on for too long? Should party officials have opted for a contested convention instead of parachuting Harris into the race? Has the party\u2019s socially progressive turn alienated some Hispanic and Black men?\n\n\nThe problem is, it\u2019s entirely possible both that the answer to all three of those questions is \u201cyes\u201d, and that taking action to address them would not have produced a fundamentally different outcome. Just as the answer to \u201cwould Britain\u2019s Conservatives have fared better in an autumn election in a lower inflation environment?\u201d is \u201cmaybe\u201d, but the response to \u201cwould it have resulted in a materially different outcome?\u201d is \u201cno\u201d.\n\n\nThe reason I make these assertions is that the economic and geopolitical conditions of the past year or two have created arguably the most hostile environment in history for incumbent parties and politicians across the developed world.\n\n\nFrom America\u2019s Democrats to Britain\u2019s Tories, Emmanuel\u2019s Macron\u2019s Ensemble coalition to Japan\u2019s Liberal Democrats, even to Narendra Modi\u2019s erstwhile dominant BJP, governing parties and leaders have undergone an unprecedented series of reversals this year.\n\n\nThe incumbents in every single one of the 10 major countries that have been tracked by the ParlGov global research project and held national elections in 2024 were given a kicking by voters. This is the first time this has ever happened in almost 120 years of records.\n\n\nUltimately voters don\u2019t distinguish between unpleasant things that their leaders and governments have direct control over, and those that are international phenomena resulting from supply-side disruptions caused by a global pandemic or the warmongering of an ageing autocrat halfway across the world.\n\n\nVoters don\u2019t like high prices, so they punished the Democrats for being in charge when inflation hit. The cost of living was also the top issue in Britain\u2019s July general election and has been front of mind in dozens of other countries for most of the last two years.\n\n\nThat different politicians, different parties, different policies and different rhetoric deployed in different countries have all met similar fortunes suggests that a large part of Tuesday\u2019s American result was locked in regardless of the messenger or the message. The wide variety of places and people who swung towards Trump also suggests an outcome that was more inevitable than contingent.\n\n\nBut it\u2019s not just about inflation. An update of economist Arthur Okun\u2019s \u2018misery index\u2019 \u2014 the sum of the inflation and unemployment rates \u2014 for this era might swap out joblessness and replace it with immigration. On this basis, the past couple of years in the US, UK and dozens of other countries have been characterised by more economic and societal upheaval than they have seen in generations.\n\n\nOf course, in the case of immigration, the distinction between unstoppable global forces and issues amenable to policy is a little fuzzier than with inflation. The rise of immigration around the world, both in numbers and salience, hints at a common global element, but clearly governments are not powerless here.\n\n\nBiden, Harris and the Democrats are not blameless for Tuesday\u2019s decisive defeat. Clearly there are lessons to be learnt. But it\u2019s possible there is just no set of policies or personas that can overcome the current global anti-incumbent wave.",

         "Realistically even a lot of the other concerns like immigration is just a scapegoat for the inflation and economic vibes. For how long has \"They're stealing our jobs\" been a dominant narrative about migrants? \n\nRacism is an explainer for *why* they become the scapegoat the same way it's an explainer why Jews were the scapegoat in the 30s, but still inevitably it's always going to be easier to maintain the hate when you have a perceived grievance that needs someone to blame it on.

Seeing the results there was clearly no way for Kamala to win this, and Biden would likely have fared even worse. \n\nPart of this is structural, part is down to Trump\u2019s magic electoral effect and nostalgia for his economy, and part is that the electorate feels disillusioned with the Democratic Party and dislike its rhetoric and governance. Voters may generally agree with key parts of the Democratic platform, but they have little confidence in them to implement and execute it. \n\nAs long as the Democrats fail to reorient their messaging to voters that are slipping away and establish a presence on new media channels to reach voters that have turned their back on the party they will struggle in this new political paradigm.",
         "A lot of people are blaming the Democrats for Trump but the Democratic platform is mostly based around maintaining the status quo and proposing policies that are widely popular even in red states. I'm not sure what they could possibly do to broaden the appeal on a policy level.\n\nThe reality is that people vote based on how their life is going and the incumbent party and the establishment in general is always going to get blamed for bad times. It's not realistic to expect one party to dominate at the national level to the extent that power wouldn't swap to the other side during something like COVID and the aftermath. The reason why someone as extreme as Trump got elected again has much less to do with anything the Democrats have done and much more to do with how unpopular the Republican establishment and traditional Republican platform is within their own party.",
         "Immigration had nothing to do with this election.  Stemming immigration would have made inflation worse, and immigration continues to be something that people care a lot about without actually seeing any negative impact from.  The Dems should have just gone all in on pointing this out, increased immigration, removed tarrifs, and do everything we could get supply chains back up and running, and there is a good chance even then we still would have lost, because a global pandemic kinda fucks us regardless.",
         ">Did Biden hold on for too long?\n\nYes. Holy shit, yes. Obviously.",
         "They did in China over the Covid lockdowns. The largest mass protests in the country's history under Communist rule. And they actually got the central government to back down and  remove pretty much all the restrictions.",
         "It's actually hard to even imagine what a free democratic election in China would look like, and how the populace would vote.",
         "> We lost the PV by ~3% in a year incumbents were getting slaughtered.\n\nTo Donald Trump.  One of the most disliked candidates and Presidents of all time.  Let's not make the same mistake that caused all this and comfort ourselves with numbers.",
         "Really not looking forward to the Czech elections next year, especially considering the government was kinda in the shits even before inflation set in \ud83d\ude48",
         "Agreed. We didn't lose due to policy, and policy changes would not be a solution.\n\nMissouri voted for Trump and Hawley, and they also voted to protect abortion rights, raise the minimum wage, and they voted against expanding the power of law enforcement and prosecutors.\n\nIt's not about policy.",
         "What if we promise to forgive even more student loans? Like a rebate? If you borrowed $40K, we'll forgive it all, and give you a check for $40K\n\nThen we'll raise tariffs on, uh, many things from other countries, but this is totally not Trump's tariffs, these are big D Democrat tariffs, which are good for you.\n\nAnd none of this will raise the deficit, because we'll implement a wealth tax but also lock the borders so the billionaires and their money can't escape.",
         "I do think we were doomed regardless, but I think immigration hurt us on the margins",
         "And a convicted felon, amazing how a criminal record doesn't matter for holding the most important job in the world's most powerful country.",
         "Disliked yes. But also uniquely capable of getting people to show up to vote",
         "Immigration likely lowered inflation on the margins, and could have lowered it even more if we embraced it without Americans even recognizing that we're increasing it.  Biden did a lot to stem immigration, with Title 42 expulsions, and keeping immigration caps low.  This didn't stop people from thinking it was a problem."

If he were a single gay man or maybe one with a partner who has a low profile, then yeah I think Americans could be ready for that. But he's got two small kids and Chasten, who's way more engaged on social media than any cabinet member's spouse should ever be. Obviously his prerogative now and no problem, but if he were the spouse of a presidential candidate, it'd cause problems. Gives me huge Teresa Kerry flashbacks. She did her husband no favors in a race he just about won.\n\nAnd for reference, I am a man married to another man with two kids. So I'm speaking from experience here. All our friends and family members were cool with my husband and I. Then when we had a child together, a lot of people got really weird. Like some of his family watch me with my daughter if he's not around. Like I'm some sort of stranger with someone else's kid.",

         "I wouldn't say that - the modern US is in many ways incredibly non-homophobic. The acceptance of homosexuality is far greater than it has been at any period in the past - as demonstrated by the fact that the far right needs to demonise trans people because demonising gay people no longer achieves their goals - and the US as a whole is considerably less homophobic than the vast majority of other countries. The problem is that the world as a whole remains inhabited by many homophobic people and, while the US may be relatively accepting of homosexuality, there are still a lot of people who harbour prejudices against anyone outside of their rigidly defined sex/gender norms. Plus, of course, the US political system happens to be weighted in various ways to favour the opinions of populations who are more homophobic (and otherwise prejudiced) than US population as a whole.\n\nI think Buttigiege is, like Obama, sufficiently politically talented that this prejudice may not be an overriding concern. I can't find the original 538 post that relates this anecdote, but it's repeated here in Salon and I'm often reminded of it when thinking about prejudice in US politics:\n\n>A man canvassing for Obama in western Pennsylvania asks a housewife which candidate she intends to vote for. She yells to her husband to find out. From the interior of the house, he calls back, \"We're voting for the ni\\*\\*er!\" At which point the housewife turns to the canvasser and calmly repeats her husband's declaration.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if, in 2028 or 2032, we'll hear stories from the rust belt and midwest about culturally conservative people happily \"voting for the f\\*g\" (at least assuming the US is still doing free and fair elections after a second Trump term). That obviously doesn't mean that Buttigiege's sexuality is a non-issue, but I don't think it's a reason to discount him entirely and focus only on straight men for another generation.\n\nEdit: Reposted because automod deleted the last one for saying \"f\\*g\" without censoring the \"a\", despite the fact that I am a fucking f\\*g and that it was entirely justified in context.

         "I wouldn't say that - the modern US is in many ways incredibly non-homophobic. The acceptance of homosexuality is far greater than it has been at any period in the past - as demonstrated by the fact that the far right needs to demonise trans people because demonising gay people no longer achieves their goals - and the US as a whole is considerably less homophobic than the vast majority of other countries. The problem is that the world as a whole remains inhabited by many homophobic people and, while the US may be relatively accepting of homosexuality, there are still a lot of people who harbour prejudices against anyone outside of their rigidly defined sex/gender norms. Plus, of course, the US political system happens to be weighted in various ways to favour the opinions of populations who are more homophobic (and otherwise prejudiced) than US population as a whole.\n\nI think Buttigiege is, like Obama, sufficiently politically talented that this prejudice may not be an overriding concern. I can't find the original 538 post that relates this anecdote, but it's repeated [here in Salon](https://www.salon.com/2008/11/03/racists_for_obama/) and I'm often reminded of it when thinking about prejudice in US politics:\n\n>A man canvassing for Obama in western Pennsylvania asks a housewife which candidate she intends to vote for. She yells to her husband to find out. From the interior of the house, he calls back, \"We're voting for the ni\\*\\*er!\" At which point the housewife turns to the canvasser and calmly repeats her husband's declaration.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if, in 2028 or 2032, we'll hear stories from the rust belt and midwest about culturally conservative people happily \"voting for the fag\" (at least assuming the US is still doing free and fair elections after a second Trump term). That obviously doesn't mean that Buttigiege's sexuality is a non-issue, but I don't think it's a reason to discount him entirely and focus only on straight men for another generation.",

She is relatable, comes from a working-class family, actually listens to people, is funny, and her laughter is contagious - though for no apparent reason it became controversial (I can only identify sexist reasons for this criticism). I've heard many people say she has no clear plan, but that's because they never watched her speeches and just believed the narrative that she has no plan whatsoever. Also, she is probably one of the most competent people we've considered for president - with experience in the current administration, as a senator, and as AG of San Francisco.

That they don't run for office as often is not necessarily misogyny.\n\n>the skew in candidates has not fallen out of the coconut tree.\n\nSure. But your suggestion is that that's due to misogyny, as opposed to women having a different set of preferences for vocation than men.\n\n538 did an analysis of this in 2020. A higher percentage of women won their primaries than ran in primaries, for both Republicans and Democrats. 20% of Republican primary candidates were women. 22% won their primary. 37% of democratic primary candidates were women, 47% won. \n\nThe evidence seems to suggest that the issue is simply that women don't want to run for office as often as men do, not that there's a significant amount of misogyny holding them back from winning those races.",
         ">He only got laughed at for those because he looked like a painted cauliflower at the time.\n\nI'm not suggesting he got laughed at or talking about that. I'm talking about how he won over people and got people to like him.\n\n>They related to him when he came down a gold plated escalator from his gold plated tower to rant about Mexicans coming to rape their daughters.\n\nA minority probably did, but this kind of analysis is something I'd expect on r/politics, not here.

Trump got less votes than in 2020. \n\n20 million fewer people voted for democrats.\n\nThat's the democrat base that's sick of not being heard. Millions of young people not voting. And ya know, it's not like Biden actually did much to help with issues like student debt, the cost of education, housing or stagnant wages. I have no idea how dems managed to let Republicans claim \"we can fix the rising cost of living\" while they actively prevented a raise in the minimum wage, which tends to lead to higher wages for a huge percentage for all bottom earners, including those that make more than minimum wage.\n\nThe far left actively campaigns against the democrats. I mean, not even that far left. Due to how unsastified they are with the party.

No, they'll vote Trump. And this maket is tapped out.\n\n>Now, actual leftist support? Not only are there a clean 20 million people that would've voted for them if they were further left, there may be tens of millions more that could support the party if it  were more left wing\n\n>And there are definitely more possible new voters than possible moderate voters\n\nThat being said, if you want another Biden, Hilary or Camala, the dems should immediately purge prossivez like AOC and Bernie from the party.

It just makes you sound out of touch and elitist.\n\nSo, the obvious answer is you poll for what people are concerned about and you speak to that.  For instance, housing?

It's like trying to reshingle the roof while the faucet is flooding the bathroom.\n\nThe floor was going to fall out from under us eventually. It just couldn't wait for us to finally repudiate Trump.

         "I believe 2 is the most important point.\n\nJeff Bezos\u2019s op-ed may have been ill-timed, but he was right that a majority of the Americans do not trust the mainstream media anymore.\n\nThe right has cultivated a very good alternative media eco-system to spread misinformation, conduct co-ordinated attacks and ramp up conspiracies amongst the base. Not to mention, young men tend to be the demographic who follow a lot of these alternative media sources, so no wonder, that crucial demographic is leaning right. \n\nDemocrats and the liberal establishment cannot fight against that at all.",

They recall pre-COVID trump and a stable, growing economy. Of course, it was an economy he inherited but nonetheless the perception and memory is there. \n\nThat is not the only reason he won, but it is probably the main reason.",

Then after that she refocuses the discussion on how much worse Rs are for shooting down the border bill.\n\nThat move was uniquely awful and it's good that Dems talked about it, but this doesn't feel like an actual platform. Is immigration good or bad? Was it good under Biden but it's bad now? It's just confusing and non committal.\n\nAnd you have to be a special kind of dumbass to not see that Democrats are moving right on immigration as a way to placate voters. So, already it doesn't feel genuine and the stance is confusing. I feel like this was the worst possible way to handle it. Either be for or against immigration and actually stand behind that.",

I know I am on the neolib subreddit - please hear me out.\n\nWe lost because of a \"vibe-cession.\"  That wasn't even a thing until this cycle. How does one even address a \"vibe-cession?\"  America has all time highs on stock indices and the best economy amongst G7 and it doesn't even matter because it is not what the (swing state) electorate wants. The only logical conclusion I can come to is that American politics is about style over substance (insert always has been meme) and that makes me extremely sad and disappointed. The general electorate is too lazy/lacks critical thinking/can't be bothered to grapple with policy. A \"vibe\" needs to be created with emotionally charged rhetoric that gets people off their seats to vote and the Dem establishment doesn't understand this. Establishment types just don't have this effect.

         "Here's my take: Democrats basically conceded several policy areas that are important to voters to Republicans, being ashamed of talking about them or knowingly repeating unpopular policy. Instead, they could have attempted to reframe the debate and come up with more serious solutions than Republicans. However, the Democrats being the diverse big tent party they are, are too afraid of enacting bold policies, which gives the much more monolithic Republicans a big advantage. There are 3 main areas where Democrats lacked vision.\n\n1. Economy and inflation: Dems allowed the vibes economy to proliferate. Inflation has been going down for a while, real wages never went down, and many economic indicators are improving. However most people still seem to have the impression that the economy is continuing to fail. Not only were the successes not talked about,  there was no plan for the next 4 years. People feel the need to make big changes. Dems could have instead taken the line that while the economy wasn't doing badly, it's important to decrease the cost of living, and that while Trump plans to make it worse tarrifs, Dems can make it better with free trade, anti-trust action, more progressive taxes that alleviate the burden on the middle class, a higher federal minimum wage, etc.\n2. Crime: Ever since BLM Dems have been stuck between upsetting the activist class by being tough on crime or upsetting the median voters. Harsher sentencing has been tried again and again and it doesn't work, but reducing sentences doesn't reduce crime either. It's time to break out of this dichotomy. Strenghen law enforcement, truly reform the police, and make sure criminal actually get arrested, not just that they get stuck in jail for years on the offchance they do.\n3. Immigration: Again, time to break outside of the dichotomy here. Most people don't want illegal immigration, but many support increased legal immigration. Get rid of the H1B cap, make it easier to get a green card, but at the same time, make it harder to cross the border illegally. Strengthen ICE and increase the number of visas given.\n\nAll of these areas were deemphasized in favor of negative things about Trump. Talk about a lack of a bold agenda was dismissed. The Democrats became the party of the status quo, and that was a very unappealing pitch. Without Dems telling voters how they would fix real problems with the country, any voter who didn't feel great would vote for Trumo as the change candidate.",

         "To elaborate on the stuff mentioned about Biden\u2019s comms team: they have been the most sophomoric, hapless bunch of incompetent communicators I\u2019ve seen in decades of watching politics.\u00a0\n\nThroughout the entire past four years, Psaki, Jean-Pierre, and everyone else on the Biden communications team have had the weakest responses to GOP talking points.\u00a0\n\nWorse than that: they\u2019ve allowed the GOP to control the narrative 100% of the time, while the Biden/Harris administration just sort of haplessly plays defense.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s notable that the only time the White House press conferences made waves in the last four years was when ***Matthew McConaughey*** replaced the usual press secretaries for one day to talk about the tragedy in Uvalde.

It's weird because they're generally the technocratic, scientific and tech-optimistic party, at least in my mind, but they decided the (unintentional) degrowthers needed a say. I imagine it's because California is not a swing state. Who knows though, New Jersey is apparently a swing state now. Even this sub decided to put on a tech-hating performance; you would think that people in tech were Nazis despite SV being a fairly liberal place. I recall people in a thread about the decline of humanities enrollment saying people in tech are incapable of critical thinking, which is why humanities is needed. Saying people in the most economically productive industry in the country are incapable of critical thinking is definitely a take.",
         "What this election showed me was that Trump didn't change many minds. He just energized his base better. It showed me that hate and fear of the other side is much more energizing than messages of unity and hope. We need to embrace the polarization and embrace a \"the other side is the enemy\" approach. We need a Frank Underwood, LBJ esque politician who's muscular and aggressive. If Democrats take this as a sign of \"only because she's a woman\" then all is lost already.

Note that the last immigration reform happened in 86 under Reagan!\n\n\nThe shares are actually staggering: half of all agricultural workers are here illegally, and IIRC the share is around 1/3 in construction. The H-2A temporary migrant worker program supplies maybe about 10-20% of workers, because it is very slow and expensive.\n\n\nAnd neither side can honestly and seriously talk about the issue. The immigration skeptics on the right will harp on about how, if we didn't have migrant workers, farms will just raise wages so that natives will work there. Maybe. We would have to raise wages to ludicrous levels probably. Turns out, people REALLY REALLY hate agricultural field work.\u00a0\n\n\nFarms are required to send job postings to state workforce agencies before applying for a H-2A visa, and response rates from unemployed Americans are incredibly low. Those who show up almost all quit after several days, and most don't show up at all.\n\n\nSo, knowing this, what would you do?",

It lets them cut their teeth and argue the case and come out of the primary with something of a mandate to push that case from the mountaintop.

         "I'm sort of loathe to engage in this game because I feel like whatever I propose, someone is going to move the ball in a No True Scotsman kind of way. To begin with, I very much dispute the idea that Rogan is a died-in-the-wool Republican with an axe to grind. If the belief is that listening to Rogan causes the Spotify algorithm to send you to Tucker Carlson and The Daily Wire, I would argue that this is at least partly because with a few exceptions like Bernie Sanders and Matt Yglesias, left-leaning people generally refuse to go on his show. I don't particularly care for Rogan, but he's not Tucker Carlson or Ben Shapiro.\n\nBut at the risk of having the ball moved on me, I will name several examples.\n\nFirst and foremost, there is the NPR \"podcast industrial complex\" that is absolutely massive. Putting aside the explicitly political politics based podcasts, you have very successful culture type podcasts like Sam Sanders' thing, like Code Switch, like Snap Judgement, like Bullseye with Jesse Thorn.\n\nOn the subject of Jesse Thorne, he has is own podcast industrial complex in r/MaximumFun. The MaxFun shows are a mixed bag of chatty comedy, high-concept goofs, and occasional discussions of culture and politics, but nearly everyone on the network is almost painfully left-leaning. (I say this as someone who actually went to MaxFunCon once.)\n\nIf you want to be more \"Rogan Like\" there are YouTube streamer types like Destiny, left-leaning liberal types with a very crass, independent streak. (Also, the Vlog Brothers are hardly in the closet. They're opinions are well known, they just choose to keep it apolitical for stylistic reasons.) People like Mark Maron have been talking about bullshit and wearing their Dem leaning credentials for decades now.\n\nIf you want anti-Trump liberals who make their nut primarily by talking about internet bullshit, there is Katie Herzog and Jesse Singal who are wildly successful with Blocked and Reported. \n\nLet's also not forget that Jon Stewart has been back for a while, in podcast form, and is quite popular.\n\nAgain, I'm aware that none of these people may be the True Scotsmen you're looking for, but the point is simply that left leaning people of all stripes are not short on options when it comes to the podcast industrial complex. Retreating to that complex or just adding another podcast \"but different\" to that ecosystem is not the answer.\n\n**edit:** Whoah. I *barely* even know who Destiny is. Like, I'm aware he has a show, a particular set of politics, and a dedicated subreddit, and not much else.\n\nCan someone loop me into what internet drama his fans created that caused someone to create an AutoModerator bot?",

We're never satisfied, we're never happy, and we seem to barely tolerate all our candidates at best, only to then act surprised that anybody else noticed.

I've gotta be real, it doesn't feel good to watch people blame me for all this when I've done everything I can to keep this fascist out of power. I get that being white and being a man is a massive leg up in today's society, but I'm not indestructible, and I know I'm not alone in feeling that way.\n\nThis is why the anti-woke stuff has been so successful for so long.

Every few decades when the economy is good this shit pops up again.  When men came back from WW2 and found their wives making more than them they got all obsessed with John Wayne and cowboys, it happend after Vietnam, and it happened in the 90s when all of the films suddenly became obsessed with making all main characters as masculine as possible. \n\nWhat you feel right now isn't unique or a recent phenomenon. It happens every decade or so and pretty much everything you claim is happening that is a war on men was probably said then.  None of those societal threats against masculinity ever materialized and they never will because they dont exist.\n\n\nEdit: the same goes for the perceived attacks on white people.  As people see characters who aren't white in media they feel like it's forced, but that's them not understanding that over 40 percent of people in the US aren't white and they like movies and video games too.

         "As a Kamala voter this doesn't shock me. Illegal immigration is the #1 political rat poison issue that killed the Democrats this cycle. Yeah inflation hurt worse but it's not like Biden can just wave the anti inflation magic wand so they had to take that one on the chin. There's not much they could have done about that but there was a hell of a lot they could have done to keep from getting annihilated on the issue of border security. Crying about how you can't do anything on the border because the mean Republicans won't let you pass a weak border bill that no one was enthusiastic about is just awful political leadership. There's a reason why this was the major talking point Trump and Vance tried to harp on during the debates. Their campaign knew how shitty the optics were for Kamala and they capitalised on that. Biden sent 1500 troops to the border for about 3 months in 2023 when title 42 was about to expire. That's the type of thing he should have been doing from day one, except it should have been 15,000 troops there permanently. I don't want to hear about how that's \"bad policy\" or \"not the correct solution to the border problem\" or whatever. Who cares? Even if it's not a perfect solution the point is that it's a solution. Sometimes you need to take a populist view of these issues and do things purely for the sake of demonstrating strength and decisiveness. Doing basically fuck all on the border for four years and letting crossings skyrocket was such an insane optics fumble.

Are you actually familiar with the changes they made? They made three major changes\n\n\n- reduced the size of lots that can be built up on from 5,750 to 1800 sq ft\n\n\n- allow up to 3 housing units to be built on\u00a0certain areas restricted to 1 housing unit\n\n\n- repeal an existing law to allow apartments to be built close to SFHs\n\n\nHow do you think this is scalable to NYC?\n\n\n> Austin also isn't just building sprawl and has greatly increased density downtown. There are skyscrapers going up all over:\n\n\nSome of this is residential but a lot of these are offices due to the tech boom. Austin is 41% zoned for SFH while NYC is 15%. Latest data I could find is from 2017 but in 2017 there were actually more SFHs as a percentage of total homes than in 1990. I'm in Austin a few times a year for work and visiting friends and there's been a steady increase in mid density apartment buildings but there's still tons of open land and SFHs still dominate.",

      "title": "This election wasn\u2019t lost because of your least favorite interest group",
      "text": "In the coming days, dozens of post-mortems will be published trying to dissect why the Democrats lost. Fingers will be pointed everywhere, and more likely than not everyone will look for a myriad of reasons why the Democrats lost, be it certain issues, campaigns strategies, constituencies defecting, etc. This election will be viewed as a catastrophic failure of the Democratic Party on brand with 2004. Every commentator across the political spectrum will claim that had the Democrats just gone with their preferred strategy, then Kamala would be President-elect right now.\n\nI think it\u2019s safe to say that all of that is reading too much into it. The Democratic Party was in complete array. Progressives, liberals, moderates, centrists, whoever, fell in line behind Kamala as the candidate. Fundraising was through the roof, the ground game had a massive amount of energy and manpower in it, and Democratic excitement was palpable.\n\nBy all accounts, the Democrats showed up and showed out for this election across the board. Unfortunately, that isn\u2019t enough. It kept the bottom from falling out like in 1972 or 1980, but the vast majority of independent and swing voters broke for the Republicans. A majority of the nation, for the first time in 20 years, put their faith in the governance of the Republican Party.\n\nThe median voter exists in an odd, contradictory vortex of mismatched beliefs and priors that cannot be logically discerned or negotiated. You just have to take them at their word. If they say they don\u2019t like inflation, it\u2019s because they believe that Biden is making the burgers more expensive. No amount of explaining why Trump\u2019s economic policies are terrible, or why Biden\u2019s policies were needed to avoid a massive post-COVID recession, or why they\u2019re actually making a paycheck that offsets inflation, will win them over. \n\nIn view of this, it was probably impossible for Kamala to win. She secured the Democratic base, made crossover appeals, and put forward some really good policies. And it worked. Her favorables are quite good, higher than Trump\u2019s, and it\u2019s obvious that she outperformed whatever Biden was walking into. Her campaign had flaws, certainly, but none nearly as obvious and grievous as Trump\u2019s. \n\nKamala being perceived as too liberal didn\u2019t matter. The Democrats being too friendly to Israel (or not friendly enough) didn\u2019t matter. Cultural issues didn\u2019t matter. Jill Stein didn\u2019t matter. Praising Dick Cheney didn\u2019t matter. The reality of the American economy didn\u2019t matter. If issue polling is correct, even immigration didn\u2019t really matter, and is mostly viewed as a proxy for the economy. \n\nWhat mattered was that 67% of voters thought the economy was doing poorly, in spite of most of them thinking that their own financial situation was fine. Voters want to see a low price tag on groceries, a DoorDash fee of $10, and a 3,500 sq. ft. house on the market for $250k, even if it means 10% unemployment and low wages for workers. Of those things, they associate it most with Trump, as much of a mirage as that is, and were willing to accept everything else for the chance to have that back. This election isn\u2019t a victory of all of Trumpism necessarily, or even a complete failure of the Democrats. It\u2019s a reminder of the priorities of the voters that will decide the election, in spite of how good your campaign was, or how economically sound your actually policies were. There\u2019s a hell of a lot that people will look past in order to have a cheap burger again.\n\nIf there is a failure, it\u2019s that Democrats spent to long believing that there could ever be a return of civility and normality. There was a clear and evident reluctance to use the full power of the state against the insurrectionists and crooks, chief among them Donald Trump. Biden thought that he could restore the soul of the nation and get people to respect and value the unwritten rules of politics that have guided us through the current liberal era. As it turns out, voters don\u2019t even care for the written ones.\n\nDon\u2019t blame the progressive, or the liberal, or the centrist Democratic voter. This election wasn\u2019t really on them. They voted. They probably donated, walked the blocks, or did some phone banking. They did what they were supposed to. If liberalism is to weather the coming storm, it will need the tent to stay intact, readjust, and come back stronger for 2026 and 2028. ",

She lost support among Hispanics. \n\n[Another source](https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/us-politics/exit-polls-2024-presidential-election-b2642034.html): **\u201cMost voters said they cast their ballot for a candidate based on their ability to lead.\u201d**\n\nYes, the economy and luck always plays a role, but the idea that we had a near-perfect campaign and near-perfect candidate is very unhelpful copium. We need to make big changes.",

Leftists accuse the losing side of being too centrist. Centrists accuse the losing side of being too leftist. \nWhen the right wing lost (Brazil 2022/USA 2020) the reaction of the losing side was to immediately assume the election was stolen.\nThis shows how solipsistic their narratives are. Real world facts and events don't disrupt them. Their narratives stick with folks. And they've got a massive advantage now that they have successfully established themselves as the \"anti-establishment\". \n\nSo yeah, center/left have to start painting a prettier picture, telling a more attractive story.

         "This is spot on. The average American doesn't spend their time reading economic literature, or have any desire to have a deeper understanding of macro-economics or international trade agreements. The majority of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck, and plugged into one of the various 24hr news cycles. Grocery prices, home prices, and rent have all gone up, and no-one can even believe that COVID could have caused that. Because COVID was in 2020 and we're in 2024, and gas was cheap during COVID so that couldn't be the reason things were expensive now. \n\nWe're in a populism era, where people are desperate for anything other than what we've been doing for the last 70 years. The \"establishment\" is the enemy, and any change is good, even if it's disastrous to a sizable portion of Americans. \n\nYou can't convince someone that \"line goes up\" means the economy is doing well when they're struggling to pay their bills. \n\nYou can't convince someone that \"immigrants are good for the economy\" when they exist in communities with almost no immigration. \n\nYou can't convince the people who watch CNN/Fox/MSNBC that crime rates are down when every single car-jacking, assault, and murder that happens 1000 miles from their house is plastered on the TV to increase viewership. \n\nYou can't convince people that \"Democrats actually have better economic policy\" when they look at the insane rates of homelessness in big cities in states like California and Illinois.\n\nThere is too much access to information that doesn't matter to most Americans, but that information will absolutely warp their perception of the world they're in. For any progressive or liberal ideas to have a chance of success ever again in the US, California and Illinois need to get their shit together. Illinois has been on a pretty good trajectory with paying off it's interstate debts, and raising a ton of cash as a rainy day fund, but JB needs to SLASH property taxes to even start to sway public opinion within the state. I moved from the Chicago area to Southern Illinois for a great job opportunity, and the vitriol down here for the northern half of the state is INSANE. And the #1 thing that people complain about besides the gun laws is the property taxes, and how it makes homeownership so difficult even in low COL areas. There aren't enough people to really have a huge demand on housing down here, and almost every one of the towns around me have plenty of mixed use buildings and walkable areas.\n\nAdd in the fact that there is a huge portion of the country that has existed in states with such deep seated bigotry/racism and religious fanaticism to the point that I'd argue that many of them don't even realize the bias they have, and you begin to realize that a female POC candidate never stood a chance.\n\nI know that over the next 4 years, that outside of any policies that will affect the overall economy, as a straight white guy working in the Military Industrial Complex, I won't have too much hardship. I'll be miserable enough with some of the proposed policies directly attacking people in my life who I care about.  I'll keep doing what I can to fight the good fight, by donating to causes that help the groups that are going to suffer the most under Trump, and by continuing to vote in every election. \n\nMaybe in 2028 the DNC will have gotten the memo that they need to have candidates that are palatable to the majority of Americans, and stop trying to win elections by catering to the \"College Educated\" upper-middle class. Dems need to very publicly step it up for the blue-collar folks over the next 4 years, and plaster their successes all over every podcast and social media platform they can.",

So much of her campaign focused on how terrible Trump was/is, combined with the usual anti price-gouging and \"he'll cut taxes for rich people, I'll cut taxes for **you**\" palaver. Trump's campaign tried as hard as they could to tie Harris to the Biden administration to take advantage of anti-incumbency sentiment. **That** is the message the Harris campaign needed to repudiate, and you can't sit there and tell me with a straight face that they did a good job in that department.\n\nWas she correct about Trump being awful? Yes. Did she hammer it effectively? Yes. But in the end, was she telling people what they already knew? Also yes. The campaign focused on giving people reasons not to vote for Trump, and less on giving people reasons to vote for her. That doesn't work with an electorate easily swayed by populism.\n\n> The theory for why Harris should focus on bread-and-butter issues instead of Trump\u2019s autocratic ambitions is simple: Nine years after Trump launched his first presidential campaign, voters already know what they think about him. And if undecided voters still aren\u2019t convinced that Trump is an authoritarian menace, they probably can\u2019t be persuaded on that point. After all, Trump-curious voters remember Democrats issuing apocalyptic warnings in 2016, yet did not personally suffer nor witness any political repression during his time in office. To the contrary, they tend to recall life under Trump as utterly normal \u2014 at least, before the worldwide pandemic for which, in their view, he had little responsibility.

Obama won Iowa, Ohio, and Florida twice; won Indiana once; and almost won Missouri. Those are non-college educated White voters he dominated with. Dems had Senators in Louisiana, Arkansas, and South Dakota. What did they do? They let in people who were culturally conservative. \n\nOn fiscal issues Obama thought it was okay to be a billionaire or a millionaire, he just thought they should pay more taxes. He praised tech companies for their innovation and was on good terms with Elon Musk. He didn't have a problem with Sheryl Sandberg being influential with a sliver of Dems like a lot of progressives do. He didn't have a problem with Wall Street execs working in his administration, as long as they worked toward his vision. He didn't start fights with groups just because he thought they were \"too powerful\" because that's stupid.\n\nAll of that is why modern day progressives hate Obama - he didn't cosplay as a warrior. Biden and the Dems did not do any of the above and it made them nothing but enemies, ran Democratic allies towards the right, and got them no concrete wins. There's a good chance the Biden's legacy will be erased in the next Congress. And for what? Because progressives want a more ideologically pure party?

People are not dumb, and the fact that apparently huge swathes of the D leadership and core supporters think they are is a big part of the problem.\n\nI can't believe I'm seeing this, but apparently the collective takeaway from drastically underperforming down ballot races (where exit polls said you hammered the least important big issue and ignored the two that were 3x as important), the down ballot races being a beating where the other side will have a full majority, and losing core party demographics is \"I played that perfectly but people are stupid and were never going to vote for the incumbent in this economy,\" with a few people going \"the reason why that happened is that we just weren't leftist enough. Why no I did not actually look at exit polls why do you ask?\"",

         "Article:\n\n\nAs Kamala Harris campaigned through the battleground states in the final days of the presidential race, she closed each stump speech with a question for the crowd: \u201cAre you ready to make your voices heard?\u201d\n\n\nThe US electorate spoke resoundingly on Tuesday night \u2014 and the majority rejected what Harris was pitching.\n\n\nIn a historic win, Donald Trump not only clinched the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the White House but is on course to become the first Republican in 20 years to win the nationwide popular vote. His party also took back control of the US Senate and appeared on course to hold on to the House of Representatives.\n\n\nTrump\u2019s emphatic victory marked a repudiation of not just Harris but also her party\u2019s progressive agenda and its failure to understand the concerns of the majority of US voters.\n\n\n\u201cIf you were hard-eyed and realistic about this, you would say this was the worst outcome at the presidential level for Democrats in this century,\u201d said Bob Shrum, a Democratic campaign veteran who worked on Al Gore and John Kerry\u2019s bids for the White House. \u201cThe Democratic party is going to have to get its act together and move forward.\u201d\n\n\nHarris, a former prosecutor who first ran for president in the 2020 Democratic primaries as a progressive, tacked to the centre when she became her party\u2019s candidate after Joe Biden stepped down following a disastrous debate against Trump in July. She vowed to be a president for \u201call Americans\u201d and put \u201ccountry over party\u201d.\n\n\nBut the pitch fell flat, and Trump was able to rack up big wins across the country, even running up his numbers in traditionally \u201cblue\u201d Democrat-controlled states such as New York and California.\n\n\n\u201cThe Democratic brand is pretty bad,\u201d said Matt Bennett, co-founder of Third Way, a centrist Democratic think-tank. \u201cThe country has shifted pretty far to the right, and we were not aware of how deep the problem ran. The voters that we lost . . . looked at Democrats and said: \u2018They don\u2019t understand my life. I don\u2019t want them representing me.\u2019\u201d\n\n\nAs they reeled from the election result on Wednesday, many in the party asked whether the Harris campaign had allowed Trump and the Republicans to paint them as too far left, or \u201cwoke\u201d, on social issues.\n\n\nThe Trump campaign spent millions of dollars on political ads focusing on transgender issues in the final stretch of the race. \u201cKamala is for they/them,\u201d one said. \u201cTrump is for you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThe ads on the transgender stuff were really unsettling to people\u201d, said Deb Dassow, chair of the Democratic party in Wisconsin\u2019s Ozaukee County, a Republican stronghold in the Milwaukee suburbs that broke for Trump.\n\n\nBut others in the party said the Harris campaign simply failed to address the key concerns of voters on inflation and the cost of living.\n\n\n\u201cIt was the economy first, second and third,\u201d said leading Democratic pollster Jefrey Pollock. \u201cHow do you win when so many voters think that the country is on the wrong track? And when the voters say wrong track, they are really complaining about the economy.\u201d\n\n\nMany in the party believe that a shift to the middle is inevitable if it is to come back in the next presidential election.\n\n\n\u201cThe only way to defeat rightwing populism is through the centre,\u201d said Bennett. Shrum agreed that having \u201ca moderately liberal, centre-left Democratic party is the only way forward if progressives actually want to win\u201d.\n\n\nBut in a sign of disagreements on the horizon, Bernie Sanders, the 83-year-old progressive senator from Vermont who caucuses with Democrats, accused the party\u2019s leaders of defending the \u201cstatus quo\u201d and said they should advocate for universal healthcare and ending US aid to Israel, among other leftwing policy changes.\n\n\n\u201cWill the big money interests and well-paid consultants who control the democratic party learn any real lessons from this disastrous campaign?\u201d said Sanders. \u201cProbably not.\u201d\n\n\nWith the possibility of internecine party warfare on the horizon, several top Democrats cautioned against getting bogged down in ideological battles.\n\n\n\u201cIt is a false choice,\u201d said Pollock. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be having an ideological debate. What we must do is connect with these voters who are clearly not responding to what we have been telling them.\u201d\n\n\nOthers urged the party to look beyond the nation\u2019s capital \u2014 and the existing leadership in the White House \u2014 for a path forward. The Democratic party still has several popular state governors, including in states that Trump won on Tuesday night. They include Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Andy Beshear of Kentucky.\n\n\n\u201cHow do we have an agenda that addresses what people want? How do we talk to them in a way that shows that we understand them and their values?\u201d said Ken Baer, a Democratic strategist and adviser in Barack Obama\u2019s White House. \u201cThat comes from outside of Washington.\n\n\n\u201cWe need a generational change,\u201d Baer added. \u201cWe have had a gerontocracy of 80-year-olds running the Democratic party since Obama left. We need new blood and new leaders.\u201d",

He\u2019s an incredible organizer, but he just chose unpopular policy positions and labeled himself and his movement socialist.\n\nThe problem is that the Dems never matched the energy Trump put out.

You've got four years to pull together the recipe, and it better look good when it's served.\n\n\"Tough on crime\" policies are like saut\u00e9ing garlic and onions - always smells good in the kitchen before the meal is done, but if that's all you serve at the end, people are going to be disappointed. Democrats had a tough set of ingredients that they were working with, and an electorate that was telling them \"it smells like shit in the kitchen right now, and I want to eat chicken alfredo, but I hate parmesan cheese\". And Democrats, in their infinite wisdom, would say things like \"actually parmesan cheese is one of the fundamental ingredients to any alfredo sauce, so you don't know what you're talking about, and this is the finest parmesan cheese we could get and I think when all is said and done, you're actually going to like it\".\n\nMeanwhile, the sous chefs are working their best, but the head chef is seen just wandering around the kitchen telling people that parmesan cheese is actually great. Meanwhile, the pasta has been boiling for 20 minutes, so the head chef gets replaced five minutes before the meal is supposed to be served and her only way to save the recipe is to say \"sure, it's technically what you wanted, but if you let me cook it again, it'll come out better this time. Also, it's still going to have the parmesan cheese you said you didn't want\".\n\nThen you have Trump, who all he does is saut\u00e9 garlic and onions, microwave some chicken, and dump store-made white sauce all over it while lying to your face that it's actually the best alfredo sauce you've ever had with no parmesan cheese whatsoever, and then pouring enough salt into it to give a horse hypertension. But when both are served, what do you think people are going to want to eat?\n\nThe decision isn't which meal tastes better, it's which one people want to order, and the mushy chicken alfredo with the best ingredients people said they didn't want might end up tasting better and being healthier, but it looks and smells bad. Meanwhile, whatever the Trump kitchen has been cooking smells pretty good and looks edible, even if it'll probably taste like salty ass and leave you feeling sick in the long term.",

It came only after Biden basically immediately got rid of a lot of Trump border policies, leading to a substantial rise in immigration that was clearly (as shown by the immigration busing) unable to work, while Biden kept with those unpopular new moves for *years* despite consistently having very low approval on immigration, before reversing course in a clearly politically motivated move relatively shortly before the election. And that all came after the 2020 primaries where Biden stood out in the liberal-sphere as \"conservative\" simply because he didn't literally support open borders (by decriminalizing illegal border crossings like most other nominees supported) and because he didn't support abolishing ICE\n\nThe Dems clearly are ridiculously out of touch with the general public on immigration and don't actually want to substantially decrease immigration (like the public wants) as opposed to just supporting a moderate bill to somewhat control the border temporarily as political expedience\n\nIn 2026 and 2028 when Dems can probably get some boost simply from anti incumbency advantage, you likely won't see Dems campaigning on any sort of immigration crackdowns, which will further show how out of touch Dems are on this stuff",

      "title": "Anger is the defining energy of western politics",
      "text": "",
      "comments": [
         "This article makes no sense to me tbh. It tries really hard to make a narrative about 'the west' that's really mostly (but not exclusively) an American phenomenon.\n\n> Even so, across western democracies the anger carousel is spinning ever faster as like-minded movements learn from the Trump playbook\n\nThe populist right-wing in Europe has grown slowly over decades, and does not owe itself to Trump. The Brexit vote is probably the biggest ticket 'anger' vote in Europe over the last decade, and it predates him by a year. The UK's attempts at a similarily 'post-truth' governance approach in the Brexit aftermath resulted in two of the most disastrous premierships in living memory with near universal public rejection, leaving a conventional-coded banker to clean up the mess. And then trying to fit Keir Starmer, the most boring, conventional dude ever invented into a narrative about how angry western politics are is as laughable as it is failed. Where the European rightwing has gained power or gotten close, it's in large part because they've temperamentally moderated into parties that don't trigger people's disgust reflexes as hard. Meloni and Le Pen, two of the most successful right-wing politicians, try their hardest to seem like 'normal' politicians who are just very anti-immigration. The trend in most right-wing parties has been towards increased moderation in all areas except immigration in order to widen their appeal. In Poland, the angry populists lost the elections and got booted out in favor of a political heavyweight veteran. According to current polling, Hungary might be headed the same way. I don't see this broad movement towards rage really.",
         "> \u201cAnger is right. Anger works. Anger clarifies, cuts through, and captures the essence of the evolutionary spirit.\u201d Well OK, Gordon Gekko was a money guy, so his famed Wall Street speech was about greed. Had he instead been a politician, he would know with equal conviction that, today, anger is the driving energy of politics.  It has always had a role. Oppositions need anger to drive out incumbents. But what perhaps is most striking about modern politics is that it has gradually become a permanent feature. \n\n> This is not to say that all the rage is irrational. Anger alone will not do the job unless it is linked to the right cause and the best of those is voters\u2019 sense of falling living standards. Immigration is another, though in part it too is a function of economic dissatisfaction. Donald Trump won for largely conventional reasons, powered particularly by the high inflation of the Biden years. In the UK, Keir Starmer harnessed anger over inflation and public services. It would be a poor politician who did otherwise. \n\n> It is not absurd for voters to place more weight on their lived economic experience than those who quote the data at them. Similarly, Brexit looks foolish as a policy response. But viewed as a choice between the status quo and change, you can see why people who felt things were not working chose the camp which acknowledged their concerns.\n\n> Even so, across western democracies the anger carousel is spinning ever faster as like-minded movements learn from the Trump playbook. It is driven not only by politicians but by a partisan media ecosystem whose economic model depends on keeping their audience in a state of permanent mobilisation, fuelled by culture wars and paranoid hyperbole about enemy elites within. TV channels, podcasters, bloggers and websites need that constant crisis to maintain audiences. Confrontational rhetoric is incentivised with clicks. Why else has anyone heard of Lauren Boebert And while the right is better at this, the left is also learning.\n\n> This has corrosive consequences that go way beyond election outcomes. In opposition it is easy. The enemy is the incumbent. But even in power the ecosystem must be fed enemies who provide alibis for failure. You need malign bureaucrats, woke elites, globalist financiers, partisan judges. Ultimately, this erodes belief in the entire system. Millions of Americans have, after all, just concluded that safeguarding democracy was less important than the other things Trump offers. The anger carousel also loves binary issues which bind in supporters. Is it a coincidence that even when voters insist their central concern is the economy, so much discourse is ever more dominated by matters which lend themselves to an absolutist debate: Brexit, Scottish independence, abortion, trans-rights, gun control, immigration, Israel/Gaza, the retreat from net zero?\n\n> This leads to the othering of your opponents, to the dehumanising language of \u201cdeplorables\u201d and \u201cgarbage\u201d, of Marxists, fascists and treason. It also serves parties in electoral systems where the choice is binary and when complete power can be won with less than a majority of votes. This is not only a right-wing phenomenon but progressives, too prone to blinkered moralising, are less effective at it. Is there a way past this? Only by finding ways to quell the anger. Clearly a vibrant economy is the best medicine, but only if it raises all boats. Boris Johnson\u2019s levelling-up agenda proved empty, but the recognition that even in boom times too many areas were being left behind was a crucial insight. \n\n> But beyond that, the core duty must be taking seriously the concerns of the voters the other side is targeting. Some will always be beyond reach. But many need not be. Fighting the anger and the betrayal narratives means reconnecting with those who believe you have stopped listening to them. The opportunities grasped by the radical right come from identifying the ordinary voters progressives have left behind. The liberal elite was never a complete fiction. One reason why Starmer won (aside from the immense help gifted him by the Conservative government) is that he paid attention to those voters Labour had lost, accepting their concerns on immigration and Brexit, and focusing on the economy, though some constraints may hobble his ambitions for growth. \n\n> Even if they draw back from Trump\u2019s most egregious constitutional abuses, populist parties can see the electoral value of permanent anger, bolstered by a media and social media system with a vested interest in an approach which has little use for compromise or constructive opposition.  If this were only about who is up or down electorally it would matter less. But permanently mobilised anger is a threat to the stability of the system and quelling it is a democratic imperative.",

This allows single goods tariffs to protect single industries (eg steel) but takes a year if there are no legal challenges.\n* Decare an emergency. Tariffs can be challenged if they don't relate to the emergency.\n* Tarif is in response to unfair trading practices. USTR investigation is required and only allows targeting of a single country.\n\nFor the broad authority Trump wants congress either has to do it themselves or give him authority. Congress is not going to give him authority because then democrats can use it too. No idea what the votes will be like with congress trying to do it but im not sure its passable.\n\nThere are many things he can mess with easilly but most of the things he has been talking about are things that would take two terms even with full support of congress. The deportations thing he is obsessed with he can't alter parole (IE intern them) for those already granted it and they can't be deported without a hearing which currently has a 5 year backlog.\n\nEven with SCOTUS the way it is the legal challenges for most of the stuff he wants to do would take more than 4 years to resolve. The Texas trick they have been using for headlines can also be used in other districts to slow walk issues like this until his term is up. The Thomas & Trump view of president kings hasn't been true since FDR, unless congress becomes productive again, they are not going to be removing barriers here.\n\nEven the Ukraine funding Democrats simply need to find enough Republicans to support a Ukraine funding bill to bypass him.\n\nTBH I am way more concerned about the executive agencies then anything he has talked about on the campaign trail. Nutritional guidelines cycle has happened to fall over an election this time with the next round due to be published end of next year (5 year cycle) which informs a huge number of programs (school lunches, prison food etc).

Turner, 48 U.S. 283, 461 (1849): \u201c**It is the cherished policy of the general government to encourage and invite Christian foreigners of our own race** to seek an asylum within our borders, and to... add to the wealth, population, and power of the nation.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd yes per the law that included Irish and Italians: https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/153d0qz/ive_heard_that_the_italians_and_irish_werent/jsj86zw/?context=9\n\n> No, **even before WWII, non-English White people were not subject to legal segregation** like African Americans. What I was trying to explain in the answer was that all of these White ethnicities were seen as \"marked\" (perceived as something other than the norm) because the \"unmarked\" White ethnic identity was English, **but they were still grouped under the heading of Whiteness**.\n\nEven socially, European emigrants were subjected to the same rate of violence lynching as local born White Americans: https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2329496518780921\n\n> **We find that European immigrants were lynched in ways, and at rates, much more similar to that of native whites** than to those of blacks. **Blacks** in the Midwest were **lynched at roughly 30 times the rate of native-born whites and European immigrants, and were sometimes ritually burned in massive \u201cspectacle lynchings\u201d while native whites and European immigrants were never burned**. We find suggestive evidence that European immigrants were perceived to have posed threats to the political order. Our results suggest that, in the American Midwest, despite nativist othering, **European immigrants were fully on the white side of the color line, and were protected from collective violence by their white status**.",
         "> They can visually pass now. It\u2019s hard to understand the racism WASP Americans had much earlier in our history, when they were able to easily identify Italians, Jews, and by god even the Irish as visually being \u201cothers\u201d and un-passable. That\u2019s some next level shit. But as groups became more acceptable and, let\u2019s say, \u201chonorary white\u201d, it was much more palatable to miscegenate with them, which allowed for the blending of phenotypes and create the stereotypical idea of whiteness we have today. \n\nTotally fair point. I still feel like literal visual blending is really powerful though, because you can't be spotted in a crowd. Being the only person of x race on a bus or something, feels really strange. \n\nLike you can tell when someone is Asian right? And Anti-asian violence spiked after Covid with random acts of violence in the street. \n\nLike, if covid had originated in Italy, I don't think Italian Americas would have faced those incidents because it's generally really hard to tell who is of Italian descent? (Obv you can tell from names etc) but random acts of violence in the street? How are you gonna tell. \n\n>(Have to specify \u201cUSA\u201d here bc we weirdly view it as a race/phenotype, as opposed to a nationality like they do in Latin America)\n\nThis is really interesting. Sorry if this a dumb question, so \"Latino\" refers to a specific nationality in South America? Or a subset of nationalities?",

First generation Latinos are marginalized based on accent and language which is why they loved Obama. Latinos (and Asians, and all other non-black groups) who were born and raised here aren't really marginalized in any meaningful capacity. I don't think voting red is a fundamental betrayal of their social interests like it is when black people vote red. Every non-black racial group has the privilege to ignore race as a topic when deciding who to vote for. \n\nEvery non-black racial group\u2019s voting patterns is pretty much the same. Basically 50-50. Maybe 60-40. Even Arabs have that privilege. Trump won Dearborn, Michigan which is the largest Arab-majority city in America.

         "This jerking off of Trump as a genius I think is silly. He won, yes, but I think that was despite being himself. This article ignores the most fundamental part of this election which was inflation. Time and time again Biden and Kamala tried to combat the inflation issue but it just never took because, well, at the end of the day prices were higher today then they were a year ago. It\u2019s just a global phenomenon that\u2019s been obliterating incumbents left and right, no matter how well they campaign or how popular they started off. I think Trump restrained the GOP from having a historic victory with Virginia, Minnesota, New Mexico, New Hampshire and possibly other blue states flip to a respectable one where the results were in line with what analysts expected as one of the two main possibilities (though I think the popular vote margins are the big shocker).\n\nI will say the critiques of Biden I far more agree with. He was slow and weak on the immigration issue that proved to be a lifeline to the GOP. He maintained his progressive views that played well with the base but didn\u2019t land well with independents and moderates and all that. So on and so forth.\n\nUltimately though I think this was a fundamentally anti-Dem environment where we did about as well as we could have given the circumstances. That we prevented Trump from flipping bluer states, kept the House within single digits and the Senate a small GOP majority is probably about as well as we could\u2019ve realistically done given the results we got",
         "Article:\n\n\nIf you think Donald Trump is too crass or cruel or incompetent to be president\u2014if you are disappointed or even astonished that, having tried and failed to subvert the will of the people in the last election, he has come back to win fair and square\u2014you should be asking yourself this question: why, to so many Americans, does the Democratic Party seem worse?\n\n\nThis victory is a tremendous achievement for Mr Trump, who after his loss in 2020 and the attack on the Capitol on January 6th 2021 was counted out even by leaders of his own party. At the time Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican leader, who privately regarded Mr Trump as \u201ca sleazeball\u201d and \u201cstupid\u201d, called the insurrection \u201cfurther evidence of Donald Trump\u2019s complete unfitness for office\u201d, according to reporting he has not disputed in a new biography by Michael Tackett, a journalist.\n\n\nYet what might seem a psychological frailty\u2014an inability to brook criticism or concede mistakes, much less defeat\u2014has for Mr Trump been a mighty source of political strength, one that intensifies his connection to the voters he has made the base of the Republican Party. As in 2016, Mr Trump wielded his command of that bloc of voters this year to clear a path through crowded Republican primaries, and then relied upon \u201cnegative polarisation\u201d, or fear of the other guys, to unite the party. \u201cCan you believe he endorsed me?\u201d Mr Trump chortled at a rally in North Carolina on November 3rd, gloating over how Mr McConnell eventually fell into line. Mr Trump felt no obligation to reciprocate. \u201cHopefully we get rid of Mitch McConnell pretty soon,\u201d he said.\n\n\nMr Trump has shown courage, not only in weathering assassins\u2019 attacks but in insisting on views on trade, entitlements and other matters that a few years ago were heresy within his party. With his sophisticated grasp of new and legacy media and his instinct for the basic needs and fears of many Americans, he has revolutionised how American politics is conducted and shifted the policy terrain over which it is waged. In terms of disrupting what came before, he has had more effect than even Ronald Reagan.\n\n\nUnlike Reagan\u2014or the other two-term presidents since, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama\u2014Mr Trump has never been very popular, though he managed, in this third run as the Republican nominee, at last to win the popular vote. Unlike those predecessors, Mr Trump has relied upon division, not addition, for his electoral maths. In his first term his average approval rating of 41% was the lowest ever measured by the Gallup Poll, which began tracking the statistic under Harry Truman. Democrats have good reason to think Mr Trump repels many voters when he calls adversaries \u201cvermin\u201d or \u201cthe enemy from within\u201d or says illegal immigrants are \u201cpoisoning the blood of our country\u201d.\n\n\nYet, after this victory, whatever disdain Democrats have for Mr Trump should be cause only for humility and self-scrutiny. As in 2016, Mr Trump\u2019s broad support will present his adversaries with a Rorschach test in which they can see their preferred image of America, and it will be ugly. For some, white supremacy and misogyny will explain Mr Trump\u2019s success, while others may attribute it to tax cuts and greed. Some will conclude that poor, non-white or female Americans have been ensorcelled into voting against their self-interest. Rather than retreat into some grand theory, they would so better ro think through how, in a divided country, President Joe Biden might have nudged the balance a few points away from Mr Trump, rather than to him. Kamala Harris was no bystander, but pime responsibility lies with the president she served.\n\n\nMr Biden did not heed his own warnings about Mr Trump. He tried to eat into Mr Trump\u2019s support with blue-collar workers through giant investments in manufacturing and infrastructure that offered something to everyone. But, unlike Mr Clinton or Mr Obama, he ducked choices that would have respected the concerns of most Americans but disappointed left-wing Democrats. A political strategy of addition still requires some division.\n\n\nMost egregious, Mr Biden resharpened Mr Trump\u2019s most effective political wedge by doing away with obstacles he had created to illegal immigration, with no alternative. By the time he restored some of Mr Trump\u2019s restrictions this spring, more than 4m migrants had crossed the southern border, compared with fewer than 1m under Mr Trump. That was terrible for the Democrats as a party, and worse for people they want to help and the cause they believe in: under Mr Biden, Americans who say they want a decrease in legal immigration rose from a minority to a majority, as did the number who favour mass deportation.\n\n\n**How to defend democracy**\n\nEven where Mr Biden had accomplishments that undermined Mr Trump\u2019s arguments, he let himself be constrained by his party\u2019s loudest activists. Oil production rose to record levels, but Mr Biden did not boast about that. He was also no longer up to the demands of presidential communication that Mr Trump understands so well. He was not constantly, energetically promoting his success in sustaining economic growth and raising wages. His approval rating sagged as low as 36% just as other Democrats were forcing him to face the obvious: he should not be running again. In the short time Ms Harris had, she waged a good campaign. But any politician would have struggled under such burdens. She could not separate herself enough from Mr Biden, or from the video Mr Trump\u2019s ads used, to devastating effect, of her recently declaring positions that were alienating to most Americans.\n\n\n\u201cWe have learned again that democracy is precious,\u201d Mr Biden proudly declared during his inaugural address almost four years ago. \u201cDemocracy is fragile. And at this hour, my friends, democracy has prevailed.\u201d Now it has prevailed again. Will Democrats get the message this time?",
         "I think this is generally the correct approach to addressing the democrats loses this election cycle.\n\nYes, we need to learn from this election. Focus on winning back the working class and Hispanic voters. Yes, the Biden and Harris campaigns made mistakes. \n\nBut fundamentally, the overall political environment, largely influenced by inflation, is what killed us. Obviously, the next four years are going to be bad, but in two years, the democrats are basically certain to win back the house, unless Trump manages to deflate the prices without causing a recession. \n\nEven though we lost this election, I think it's important to not start throwing away correct policies that at most had a marginal impact on the election, i.e. trans rights, green energy, etc.",
         "I think this is absolutely the correct take, but I would add immigration as another accellerant.\u00a0 There was a historic rise in immigration that overwhelmed social services across the US, and in the immediate aftermath of Covid when many services and communities were already reeling.\u00a0 Biden, and the like minded community (that means us) were too slow to recognize and adddress the reality and couldn't get past the rhetoric that open borders are better than closed borders.\u00a0 When Biden finally acted, it was literally years after Abbot and Meatball Ron had started their high profile bussing.\u00a0\u00a0",

The fact of the matter is, if Harris wasn't sure about something offhand, she'd pivot to something else, or tell people to view her policies on her website.\n\nIf Trump was asked about something he didn't know, he would just talk about what he feels the right answer is. People would jump on that for being wrong, or lying, or misinformation. But the simple truth is that kind of response just looks better than avoiding an answer in an attempt to be accurate. Biden did the same thing, and his gaffes didn't cost him his election. Voters don't mind gaffes, they don't care if you're wrong about something, so long as you show that you care about their issues and want to help them.",

         "I am drunk and didn't realize it was paywalled:\n\nWell, that obviously didn\u2019t go the way I would prefer.\n\nI\u2019ve made no secret of the fact that I think Trump is a terrible choice for America, but there\u2019s no denying that the American people have made their choice. Trump is currently projected to win every single swing state. He outperformed his 2020 performance in every single county in the country. He\u2019s projected to win a solid majority of the popular vote \u2014 the first time a Republican has done so since 2004. I still don\u2019t like the Electoral College as an institution, but you can\u2019t blame it for this result like you could for 2016. In fact, Trump\u2019s victory was part of a more general Republican landslide \u2014 the GOP took the Senate and improved its majority in the House. A map of political shifts between 2020 and 2024 shows almost solid red.\n\nI suppose a small silver lining here is that we won\u2019t have to spend the next two months enduring waves of \u201cStop the Steal\u201d election denials, lawsuits, and threats to repeat January 6th. Democracy delivered Trump a victory, and so Trump has little incentive to attack democracy.\n\nIn fact, that silver lining might extend to the long term too. Trump and the GOP won because nonwhite voters and working-class voters \u2014 traditional Democratic constituencies \u2014 shifted his way. Dems still won Hispanic, Black, and Asian voters overall, but their margins fell significantly from previous elections, while actually improving with White voters:\n\nIn fact, exit polls show Trump winning a solid majority of Hispanic men!\n\nRonald Reagan\u2019s prophecy that Latinos would become Republicans is coming to pass.\n\nIncome has realigned as well. Democrats are now the party of the educated upper middle and wealthy class, but have lost their appeal to the middle and working classes:\n\nThis largely destroys the narrative that nonwhite immigration will demographically drown White Americans under a tide of imported minority votes. In fact, it vindicates my guest poster Wally Nowinski, who observed that high-turnout elections like this one now help Republicans, because marginal voters \u2014 working-class Americans and Hispanic Americans \u2014 now lean to the right:\n\n\nAt some point, Republicans are going to realize this, and hopefully become less anxious about America\u2019s racial future. Hopefully they will also realize that any attempt to make voting harder actually hurts them in the future, because the impact would fall disproportionately on their own base.\n\nI expect these realizations to take some time to sink in, but ultimately their effect could be very salutary for American democracy. In the days of Nixon and Reagan, Republicans never worried about democracy itself \u2014 it was obviously on their side. Even in 2004, Republicans could tell themselves that we lived in a \u201ccenter-right nation\u201d. Now, Trump\u2019s victory, powered by lower-income Americans and Hispanic men, will hopefully convince the GOP that democracy is still a game they can win.\n\nA democracy needs both major parties to believe they can win via persuasion rather than by organized resistance, and 2024 showed that Republicans can still do that \u2014 even if the method of persuasion is one that I personally wish hadn\u2019t worked so well.\n\nIf you want an optimistic take, there it is.\n\nSo what other important lessons can we learn from this disappointing election result? I didn\u2019t title this post \u201cWhy Trump won\u201d, because I don\u2019t think I really have a convincing answer \u2014 I\u2019m not a political scientist, or even a political pundit. In fact, there are probably a bunch of reasons, not just one.\n\nNor am I going to be one of those pundits who tells you that if only Democrats had listened to my policy priorities, things would have gone very differently. In fact, few Americans care about my own policy priorities. My top issues are industrial policy and pro-democratic foreign policy. I definitely don\u2019t think emphasizing those more, or doing more of those things, would have propelled Harris to victory. (I don\u2019t think they would have hurt; I think voters just don\u2019t care.)\n\nBut I do think there are some important lessons that we can already learn from this election, especially at the intersection of economics and politics. In particular, I see three big ones:\n\n    Identity politics \u2014 viewing racial groups as homogeneous \u201ccommunities\u201d to be targeted with appeals to collective grievances \u2014 is not an effective way of winning over Hispanic (or, probably, Asian) voters.\n\n    People care about inflation more than about unemployment.\n\n    The educated professional class has become dangerously out of touch with the rest of the country.\n\nInstead of writing all of these in one post, I\u2019m going to split it into three, because I think the lessons are each very important. Today, since I\u2019ve already shown the racial and class breakdown of the exit polls, I\u2019ll talk about how identity politics is failing Democrats. Whether or not you think identity politics drove voters into Trump\u2019s arms, it certainly hasn\u2019t done an effective job of retaining Hispanic voters. The whole approach needs a deep rethink.\nAmericans are individuals, not extensions of racial \u201ccommunities\u201d\n\nIn the 2010s, there was a big debate over identity politics, with scholars like Francis Fukuyama warning that treating the American electorate as a balkanized set of racial collectives was undermining democracy. Stacey Abrams and other progressive writers pushed back against Fukuyama, arguing that all politics is identity politics, and so Democrats should continue focusing on racial appeals.\n\nAbrams et al. were right in the facile, definitional sense that people\u2019s personal identification with larger groups, movements, and ideas \u2014 rather than their own personal economic interests \u2014 drives much of their political behavior. After all, if human beings were rational calculating machines, they wouldn\u2019t even vote, given the incredibly low probability that any election will be decided by a single vote.1\n\nBut the 2024 election \u2014 even more than the 2020 election \u2014 makes it clear that most Hispanic and Asian voters don\u2019t want to be appealed to based on the racial group of which they\u2019re supposedly a part. For example, lenient policies toward asylum seekers from Latin America don\u2019t seem to have won over many Hispanics:\n\n    In Hidalgo County, in South Texas \u2014 a Mexican American stronghold that Biden won with 58% of the vote in 2020 \u2014 Vice President Harris and Trump were virtually tied early Wednesday, with Harris leading by less than half a percentage point\u2026In Cameron County, at the southern tip of Texas' Rio Grande Valley, Trump led Harris, 52-47, according to early results. Biden won that county with 56% of the vote four years ago.\n\nThe whole notion that lenient policies on illegal and quasi-legal immigration would win inroads with Latinos was based on the idea that Hispanic Americans identify strongly with others of their same race. Political scientists call this the theory of \u201clinked fate\u201d.\n\nDemocrats clearly buy into this theory when they refer to racial groups as \u201ccommunities\u201d. This term has become ubiquitous in Democratic messaging \u2014 for example, Harris talked about her \u201ceconomic agenda for the Latino community\u201d.\n\nBut races are not communities. Our country is not like a segregated 1930-era city, where Black people live in a ghetto, Chinese people live in Chinatown, Italian people live in Little Italy, and so on. Hispanic and Asian Americans might share a sense of \u201clinked fate\u201d with others of their race, but it\u2019s only one of many things they care about, and perhaps not even a major one.\n\nThe big exception, of course, is Black Americans, who continue to vote mostly like a racial bloc, despite Trump\u2019s modest inroads with Black men. This has clearly influenced the Democrats\u2019 view of how racial politics operates in America, and they\u2019ve tried to apply the same mental model to Hispanics and Asians. This is explicit in California, where you hear the term \u201cBlack and brown\u201d thrown around a lot.",

         "But it isn\u2019t working. In fact, it\u2019s backfiring. A recent paper by d\u2019Urso and Roman found that use of the term \u201cLatinx\u201d actually made Hispanics vote for the Republicans in nontrivial numbers!\n\n    Group labels are political, but little theory and evidence explains how group labels shape politician evaluations\u2026Latinos\u2019 relationship with \u201cLatinx,\u201d a gender-inclusive label, is a theoretical test case. Using several datasets, we find: Latinos are less likely to support politicians who use \u201cLatinx\u201d\u2026Latinos who oppose \u201cLatinx\u201d are less likely to support politicians who used or are associated with \u201cLatinx\u201d\u2026Latinos in areas where \u201cLatinx\u201d is more salient are more likely to switch their vote toward Trump between 2016-2020[.]\n\nOne common interpretation of this result \u2014 and one the authors discuss \u2014 is that many Latinos are conservative, and that this makes them susceptible to \u201canti-LGBTQ+\u201d labels. I\u2019m highly skeptical of this interpretation. Outside small, highly educated, deeply progressive circles, who even knows that the purpose of the \u201cx\u201d in \u201cLatinx\u201d was to be trans-inclusive? Almost no one who is likely to be offended by the term is even aware of this.\n\nInstead, what they hear is simply someone making up a weird label and applying it to them. It\u2019s what sociologists call ascription \u2014 it\u2019s someone making up a racial category for someone else and then stuffing them into it without their consent. The Occam\u2019s Razor explanation for Hispanics\u2019 dislike of \u201cLatinx\u201d is that it minoritizes them \u2014 it declares that they\u2019re part of a special \u201ccommunity\u201d, separate from other Americans.\n\nDemocrats\u2019 purpose in assigning Americans to \u201ccommunities\u201d, of course, is not to exclude them, but to reward them \u2014 to hand them special prizes or favors via government policy. For example, the Biden administration had a whole policy oriented around giving government benefits specifically to \u201cHSIs\u201d \u2014 an abbreviation for \u201cHispanic-Serving Institutions\u201d, i.e. colleges that a lot of Hispanic people tend to go to. Harris also had a plan for encouraging small banks to give Hispanic people more loans.\n\nThis is, fundamentally, a special-interest model of politics \u2014 it\u2019s similar to the kind of quid pro quo that historically dominates much of urban machine politics. I\u2019m not sure whether today\u2019s Dems inherit their instinct for this kind of group giveaway from their old Tammany Hall days, but it\u2019s recognizably similar to the way California cities hand out cash to favored nonprofits \u2014 especially because the programs are often targeted at colleges or banks or nonprofits or other organizations that claim to serve the racial \u201ccommunity\u201d in question.\n\nBut there are notable downsides to this approach. First, unlike in a city, these targeted initiatives probably don\u2019t make it through to the public consciousness. What Puerto Rican voter in Philadelphia even knows what the heck an \u201cHSI\u201d is? But more fundamentally, I think most Americans, including most Hispanic Americans, would rather be treated as individuals than as members of a racial \u201ccommunity\u201d.\nIdentity politics and minoritization\n\nIdentity has many components. For my part, I identify as an American, a Texan, a liberal, a rabbit keeper, a writer, a nerd, a PhD holder, a science fiction fan, a Jew, a white person, a Lithuanian-American, and so on.3 If politicians primarily spoke to me as part of the \u201cJewish community\u201d, I would be annoyed, because I don\u2019t necessarily want to be defined by that component of my identity. I don\u2019t reject it, but I don\u2019t want to be reduced to it either. And if politicians tried to appeal to me with policies targeted through Jewish organizations to benefit Jews, I would simply not care. In fact, I would be a little conflicted about accepting any of those benefits, since it would pigeonhole me into prioritizing an identity that exists as only one component among many.\n\nEven more fundamentally, being constantly minoritized \u2014 being told to think of myself as a Jew first and as an American second \u2014 would pressure me to shrink the circle of people that I consider part of my own in-group. Because I think of myself as an American first and foremost, I feel like there are 330 million other people who share my primary identity \u2014 330 million people on my \u201cteam\u201d. But if I were to think of myself first and foremost as a Jewish person, that would shrink my in-group to only 16 million, almost none of whom live near me. It would make me feel more isolated, and might even cause me to start questioning whether the 323 million non-Jewish Americans who live all around me have my best interests in mind.\n\nIn other words, being set apart from your fellow countrymen and neighbors is generally not a desirable thing, even if the reason is to put you on a pedestal.\n\nI suspect many Hispanic Americans feel the same way. Talking to Hispanic folks (remember, I\u2019ve lived most of my life in either Texas or California) and reading books like The Diversity Paradox, The New Americans?, and The Great Demographic Illusion, it seems clear that most would like to think of themselves as regular Americans \u2014 not to give up or forget their national origins or ethnic identity, but to prioritize their American-ness.\n\nThe progressive movement of the 2010s told us that this was a bad thing. \u201cAssimilation\u201d became a dirty word in progressive circles, and the University of California told their faculty not to call the U.S. a \u201cmelting pot\u201d. The implicit assumption was that given the choice, people would like to prioritize their racial and ethnic identities, and that only forcible conformity pressure from American institutions \u2014 or from White people \u2014 was preventing people of color doing that. The Democratic party\u2019s embrace of identity politics \u2014 its habit of targeting racial \u201ccommunities\u201d with encouraging rhetoric and specific material benefits \u2014 was seen as a way to counteract the pressures of assimilation.\n\nThe conservative counter-narrative was that race relations had been fine right up until progressives started making everything in America about race. Conservatives always send me the following chart:\nSource: Gallup\n\nThis is a powerful argument. If structural racism was really so entrenched before 2014, then why did two-thirds of Black adults say race relations were good? Essentially, the progressive story is that they were effectively bullied into saying this \u2014 or perhaps bullied into thinking it. The conservative story is that progressives created the decline in race relations by making everyone think about race all the time.\n\nI suspect that neither of these stories gets it quite right, but that the conservative story is closer to the truth. Increasing the salience of racial divisions and racial conflict makes people mistrust their neighbors more. And although both sides were guilty of this in the 2010s, progressives were far more zealous and absolutist about it.\n\nEssentially, the progressivism of the 2010s sought to turn American society into a sort of estate society, where people\u2019s rights, privileges, and social roles would be mediated by their identity group. How your teachers and principals treated you, your relationship with the law, what colleges were available to you, what kind of parties you could go to, what jobs you could get hired for, how your bosses treated you at work, what kind of benefits you could expect from your government, and even how people walked past you on the street were to be determined by the race you were born into, rather than your own actions as an individual.\n\nThese race-based social relationships were to be enforced by a combination of DEI departments, lawsuits, social shaming, job loss, and so on. Ibram X. Kendi even suggested the totalitarian step of creating a constitutionally mandated \u201cDepartment of Antiracism\u201d to enforce race-based social relations at every level of society \u2014 all in the name of combatting \u201cstructural racism\u201d, which Kendi couldn\u2019t even define when asked.\n\nDemocratic party politicians never fully embraced this vision of the future, even in 2020-21. Some of these ideas were tried out in 2020-21, but they failed almost as quickly as they were tried, making basically everyone mad in the process. By 2024, Kamala Harris was tacking pretty strongly away from the racialized vision of America.\n\nBut that was too little, too late. People remember the individualistic Americanism largely prevailed in public life before 2014, and they remember the constant hyper-consciousness of race in 2014-21, and they know which one they like better. And although Democrats abandoned much of their woke rhetoric, the practice of targeting politics at specific \u201ccommunities\u201d has persisted. I suspect that it refreshes the bad memories of the racial conflicts of 2014-21.\n\nAll of this is a long-winded way of saying that Democrats\u2019 racial targeting probably makes a lot of Hispanic people feel singled out and alienated in their own country, even if the purpose is to help them.\n\nBut that\u2019s not all. Democrats\u2019 identity politics flies strongly in the face of the narrative that has defined the American experience for many Hispanics.\nThe story of Hispanic voters is defined by the American Dream",

For a while, people argued that Hispanics were different \u2014 that they would be permanently excluded from the American Dream.

For example, a model of intergenerational mobility analogous to Becker and Tomes (1979) predicts that the gap will shrink from the 22 percentile difference between Hispanic and white parents observed in our sample\u2026to 6 percentiles in steady state\u2026\n\n    Hispanics are on an upward trajectory across generations and may close most of the gap between their incomes and those of whites\u2026Their low levels of income at present thus appear to to be primarily due to transitory factors.\n\nIn fact, despite composition effects from continued immigration, Hispanic wages have grown faster than White wages in America since the turn of the century:\n\nSurveys unsurprisingly have found widespread economic optimism among Hispanics for many years. Hispanics are climbing the ladder of education:\nSource: Census Bureau\n\nHispanic homeownership is rising strongly. And Hispanics are starting businesses at very high rates:\n\n    New businesses owned by Latinos accounted for 36% of launches in 2023\u2026As of 2023, Latino entrepreneurs have established a staggering five million businesses across the United States, collectively generating over $800 billion in annual revenue\u2026The rapid pace of this growth is further highlighted by the fact that the number of Latino/a-owned businesses surged by 34% from 2007 to 2019.\n\nIn other words, Hispanic Americans\u2019 economic path looks reasonably similar to that of Italian Americans or Irish Americans.\n\nIn the 2010s, it became taboo to even talk about these successes in some progressive circles. The University of California\u2019s 2015 speech guidelines told faculty not to say \u201cAmerica is the land of opportunity\u201d. This was deemed to be a racist utterance, since it supposedly minimized the economic exclusion that many minority groups have faced.\n\nBut the fact is, America is the land of opportunity, especially for immigrants and their children. Hispanic Americans, broadly speaking, have been prime beneficiaries of that upward mobility \u2014 they have worked incredibly hard, gone to school, started businesses, learned English, and done everything else they were supposed to do. And America has rewarded them with economic success and social integration.\n\nCompared to that self-bootstrapped success, racial preferences \u2014 DEI, affirmative action, preferential government contracts, and so on \u2014 are basically a booby prize. Yes, in reality, those policies can sometimes help accelerate Latino achievement. But the mere fact that they\u2019re on offer \u2014 and that Democrats seemingly view them as permanent policies instead of temporary ones \u2014 sends the message that Hispanics are a permanently racialized, excluded, marginalized group. This message is often explicit \u2014 when Democrats and progressives talk about \u201cmarginalized groups\u201d, which they often do, that term is generally supposed to include Hispanics.\n\nBeing a marginalized group is simply not part of anyone\u2019s American Dream.\n\nThe tricky part for Democrats is that this is an approach that has largely worked with Black voters \u2014 or at least failed to alienate them. It will be difficult for Democrats to convince themselves that Hispanic voters are not going to work the same, after spending so many years believing they would. But the 2024 election, and the trend of the last few elections, makes it clear that the two are not going to work the same.\nAfter identity politics\n\nIdentity politics allows Democrats to hold on to a supermajority of the Black vote, so I suspect it will never go away. But the Black vote is a smallish and shrinking part of the electorate, and even there, the power of idpol may be fading a bit. Meanwhile, Hispanic voters, Asian voters, and Middle Eastern voters are the future. Those groups are all strongly upwardly mobile, and mostly descended from people who came to America voluntarily in search of the American Dream. And although ethnic studies professors and progressive activists will happily tell you all about the Chinese Exclusion Act and post-9/11 Islamophobia, it\u2019s just not the case that Hispanic, Asian, and Middle Eastern Americans have anything that compares to the history of slavery and segregation.\n\nThe Democrats need to move away from identity politics. And switching to class-based politics, as some have suggested, won\u2019t really help. Biden was probably the most pro-union and pro-worker President America has had since the mid 20th century, and yet some prominent unions refused to endorse Harris.\n\nInstead, Democrats need to retool their message to be about American identity, as it was in the New Deal days, and as it arguably was for Clinton and Obama. I believe Harris actually took steps in the right direction, but not enough, and not nearly soon enough \u2014 and she was probably the wrong person to sell the idea. My advice is not to be discouraged, and to keep at it \u2014 Walter Mondale and Michael Dukakis both went down to crushing defeats with centrist, positive messaging, but then Bill Clinton eventually figured out how to make the approach work.\n\nRepublicans will eventually screw up. Trump is old, and he has a lot of foolish and bad people around him, and his economic policy program is kind of a dead end. At some point, America will once more call upon the Democrats to save them from Republican mistakes, as they did in 2008 and in 1992. Democrats will have an easier time rising to that inevitable summons if they leave the identity politics of the 2010s behind. Because that stuff just isn\u2019t getting the job done.",

Same shit with the SCOTUS pick.\n\nMy potentially hot take on all. this: while the Harris campaign didn't jump into the race issue, the problem was, she was tied to the Biden administration which absolutely did. And Biden, in classic Biden fashion, did it in an old heavy-handed patronizing way.\n\nIn the wake of George Floyd and BLM, I get that this was popular and probably just, but by picking a specific racial group (predominantly African American) to focus on, the Dems fucked up the golden rule of all this: they found a way to divide and drive away other racial groups.\n\nBiden could have picked Brown for SCOTUS without telling everyone that he was going to pick a black woman before he did it. The minute you say you are going to do that, eyebrows from every other group get raised. And for some groups, there's always the \"why them, and not us?\" \n\nPeople act like minorities are a monolith that should respond as a bloc, when that's far from the truth. So by picking one group, you're automatically excluding others.\n\nSo it went for his entire shtick of picking Harris as VP in the first place, saying it was going to be a woman. Like, the fuck? Just do it, don't automatically give everyone the perception that half the populace is ineligible because they weren't born that way.\n\nI'm not surprised that there were major shifts in Hispanic and Asian areas - the feeling of being less valued or catered to in favor of other groups isn't going to be taken well. Especially when a lot of issues (like for Asians, the issues with taking away certain school programs, affirmative action, the complete blind eye turned to anti-Asian hate crimes especially those committed by other minorities, etc.) get pushed by the Dem political sphere, then ignored by the Dem political sphere when things go wrong.\n\nThey also completely ignored one of the things Obama did great and why he got massive margins among minorities both elections - he talked about commonalities and uplifting everyone, instead of focusing on specific groups.",

Nearly eight in ten Republicans (79%) favor putting undocumented immigrants in encampments, compared with 47% of independents and 22% of Democrats.\n\nThis is from the survey itself. \"Militarised camps\" is an inaccurate shift of language that completely changes the  meaning. The implication between \"militarised camps\" and \"even if\" are far different.\n\nThe summary is also wrong, as \"47%\" either refers to the total hat support deportation even **if** it involves military encampments, or the 47% of independents that favour just encampments. Neither of those actually match the description given by the article.\n\nFrom the survey itself, it's far less extreme. The idea or camps isn't... that radical. Afterall, it is effectively what an immigration detention centre is. The only thing of note from this part of the study is that military involvement is only a red like for 53%.\n\nWhen it comes to polling, it's incredibly important that the language of the survey is maintained almost untouched when reporting on it.

      "comments": [
         "> The Bank of England cut its key interest rate for the second time this year, saying it was increasingly confident that inflation is coming under control. The Monetary Policy Committee voted decisively to lower the Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points to 4.75 percent. External member Catherine Mann, typically the most hawkish voice on the MPC, cast the only vote for no change. But it warned that it now sees inflation staying above its 2 percent target for longer than previously, due partly to the new Labour government\u2019s spending plans. \u201cThere has been continued progress in disinflation, particularly as previous external shocks have abated,\u201d the Bank said in a statement.  But it warned that \u201cremaining domestic inflationary pressures are resolving more slowly.\u201d It repeated that \u201ca gradual approach to removing policy restraint remains appropriate,\u201d and said that policy \u201cwill need to continue to remain restrictive for sufficiently long until the risks to inflation returning sustainably to the 2 percent target in the medium term have dissipated further.\u201d \u201cWe need to make sure inflation stays close to target, so we can\u2019t cut interest rates too quickly or by too much,\u201d said Governor Andrew Bailey.\n\n> The headline rate of inflation fell to 1.7 percent in September, comfortably below the Bank\u2019s medium target. It also cut its forecast for year-end inflation, now seen at 2.4 percent versus the 2.7 percent it had predicted in August. But the Bank now estimates it will take a lot longer to return to target sustainably. While in August the BoE had expected that by the start of 2026, its new median forecast only sees it happening in the second quarter of 2027, a full 18 months later. Part of this is down to Chancellor Rachel Reeves\u2019s autumn budget, which promises an extra \u00a370 billion in spending next year. In its new Monetary Policy Report, the Bank wrote that it expects the budget to push inflation up by just under 0.5 percentage points at its peak in a year\u2019s time. The extra government spending is also expected to boost gross domestic product by about 0.75 percentage points.\n\n> Conspicuously absent from the MPR was any explicit mention of Donald Trump and his wide-ranging tariff proposals. The Republican president-elect only became the clear winner by the time the Bank had already convened on Wednesday, but he\u2019s been vocal about his desire to renew the trade war he started in his first term in office, floating tariffs of 10 or 20 percent across the board on all of America\u2019s trade partners. The BoE didn\u2019t directly address the threat to trade relations between the UK and its largest single export market, but it did write that, while expects import prices to take longer to come down than it previously thought. \u201cTaken together these effects are expected to raise UK [headline] inflation by 0.2 [percentage points] relative to the August report,\u201d it writes. Export prices and currency exchange rates have stayed subdued in recent months, the Bank noted, but it flagged the possibility of \u201clarge movements in sterling or in world export prices in the future, or in the presence of large and heterogenous shocks in the prices of different goods.\u201d\n\n> The Bank stressed multiple times that there was extreme uncertainty over the future path of inflation. Data for the labor market in particular \u201care difficult to interpret\u201d while growth in wages \u201chas been more elevated than usual relationships would predict.\u201d The  Office for National Statistics has been warning that the quality of its labor data has declined because fewer people are answering its surveys. Recent disinflationary pressure has been concentrated in more volatile categories like energy. As that effect fades, the downward pressure on prices will ease. Inflation in the prices of services, meanwhile, is expected to remain \u201cbroadly unchanged\u201d over the next six months. Service prices are closely linked to wages. The Bank wrote that while average weekly earnings had \u201cfallen back significantly\u201d since the middle of the year, they remained elevated, growing at an annual pace of 4.8 percent in the three months to August.\n\n!ping UK",

         "In this podcast, Frank Fukuyama speaks with Yascha Mounk about the election of Donald Trump, his authoritarian tendencies, and the rise of tech oligarchs like Elon Musk.\n\n  \nOne topic they speak extensively on is the authoritarian tendencies of Trump and what it would look like in practice.\n\n\n\n>**Mounk**: Let's get to the heart of the matter. How dangerous is Donald Trump going to be for America's democratic institutions over the course of the last four years? How should we think about assessing the extent of that danger?\n\n>**Fukuyama**: Well, I think the primary threat is to the rule of law. He's been very clear in the last few months and weeks that he's really out for revenge. He wants to take revenge on all the people that he believes have been prosecuting him and or persecuting him. And I think that this is where Schedule F really matters because, in his first term, he couldn't get his own Justice Department to go after Hillary Clinton, even though he wanted them to. But he understands that that was a weakness of his first term. And I think he's going to put people in key positions in the Justice Department that will enable them to open up investigations.\u00a0\n\n>Let me just give you one concrete example. The head of the IRS is subject to what they call \u201cfor cause dismissal,\u201d meaning that he's got to commit some crime or some really overt offense before you can fire him. Schedule F is going to get rid of that. There are hundreds of these \u201cfor cause\u201d positions throughout the government. So if Trump can fire the head of the IRS, and put a loyalist in there, then you could open up a tax audit against a journalist or head of an NGO or the NGO itself, that will be incredibly harassing and will tie the organization or the individual up in all sorts of legal fees. So, you're not talking about a Putin-style putting everybody in a gulag, but you are giving the executive incredible power against individuals and against organizations. And I think that that'll be kind of one of the primary lines of attack."

Merkel had the benefit of the reforms enacted under Schr\u00f6der that pretty much destroyed his political career, even though he did the right thing, as many people now admit. Then Scholz inherited the consequences of Merkel's 16 years of inaction, which is now blowing up in his face.\n\nOn the other hand, Scholz was never popular, and basically nobody really wanted him as Chancellor.

If we hold back the more authoritarian policies until after 2026, I can\u2019t imagine we won\u2019t retake Congress after the reality of Trump\u2019s economic policies set in and voters learn tariffs don\u2019t make prices go down and that deporting half of American agriculture workers doesn\u2019t either",
         "they are still counting, he will get about the same.",
         "Why do people keep saying this?\n\nThere are probably over 3 million uncounted Trump votes in California alone to bring him over his 2020 totals.",
         "Except Trump's numbers didn't change from 2020. In fact his worse a little worse. The issue is the 15 million Dem's from 2020 who didn't show up in 2024. Trump performed mediocrely, but the Dem's performed abysmally.\u00a0",
         "Human beings as a whole don't seem capable of recognizing propaganda and ignoring it. Fear and hate have been peddled by people like Trump for a long time and we clearly don't learn from it.",
         "The only counter to fear and hate isn't to turn away from it, but face it with faith in love and hope. Americans right now would rather destroy the institutions they stopped trusting than returning to \"normalcy\".",

         "I really don't think that friendliness is that genuine, which is reflected in our immigration system. Sure, some people are friendly and some are hostile. But the vast number of people simply don't care about you - they will smile and say nice things but will gladly throw you under the bus for a promise of cheaper egg prices. Got to take care of \"real Americans\" first, right?",

         "Trump is like the GOP Obama. A once in a lifetime candidate who does extremely well with low propensity voters. \n\nOnce he\u2019s not on the ticket those voters don\u2019t show up. It\u2019s why the democrats have effectively won the midterms.",
         "Agreed. My gut kept telling me Harris would pull through and win Michigan and Arizona, and now not one of those is happening. Who can you trust if you can't even trust yourself lol.",
         "No offense but highlighting Chinese immigration over Maori when discussing multiculturalism and diversity in NZ is super questionable to put it mildly. Just because Maori aren't immigrants doesn't mean it's not multiculturalism and that Maori pakeha relations aren't indicative of relevant ethnic/racial dynamics. \n\nIt would be like ignoring the massive subset of Mexican/Spanish descendants in western US just because their familiy has been in the area for over 100 years. \n\nNZ isn't perfect in the respects you mentioned but from an objective standpoint they are comparable to blue states. The hard part about NZ being an alternative is the economic aspects, not the social aspects. \n\nAlso NZ is 2/3rds the size of Japan. One could probably quadruple the population (+15m) without really doing much damage to NZ conditional on proper cultural alignment.",
         "Trump esque is putting it nicely. Liberals are going to lose by 20 lmao. Dems performed comparatively well to the rest of the worlds incumbent parties.",
         "This is an even bigger black pill if you think about it. Canada has always been a bastion of immigration, liberalism and diversity. To know that not even Canada is safe from right-wing populism makes me feel like there is no escape from this anywhere in the world.",
         "Yeah and that\u2019s a big IF. It\u2019s likely there could be no institution that insure that happens after this election.",
         "Remember to the average person J6 was: a riot that happened outside of Trump's control, like no one died, it was embarassing but you know, fat rednecks being dumb rednecks.\n\nThen 4 years pass and people forget more and more of it, but rent/mortgages cost more, and eggs are like 4x more expensive, and a tank of gas costs too much, and the job market is a bit fucky. So fuck the guys in power, 5 years ago it wasn't that bad.",
         "I don't know how much people don't care that Trump attempted a coup, and how much people are simply uninformed or don't take it seriously. Trump has already been president. So when we point out his threats to democracy, people don't take it seriously because there were no persecutions or purges when he was in office, he left office in the end and democracy continued on as normal. \n\nHow do you even counter that? Anyone who knows how dangerous Trump is, is already voting democrat anyway. It also doesn't help that people are desensitized by Trump after being exposed by him for 8 years. So nothing that he says shocks anyone.",
         "Democracy was alive and well just fine during the spoils system.",
         "That is a good point.\n\nNow I\u2019m not an American, but aren\u2019t most of your electoral rules set at the state level (e.g. counting procedures, ID requirements)?",
         "Oh I agree that Project 2025 is terrible for the exact reasons you mention.\n\nMy point is that it doesn\u2019t instantly make it impossible to vote out Republicans; I think the direct electoral impacts are overstated.",
         "Oh believe me I hate Project 2025 and its consequences for policy and governance.\n\nI narrowly took the reply to mean that voting them out in 2028 will be impossible/very challenging, a take which I have heard a lot and disagree with. I don\u2019t dispute that they can do a lot of damage between now and 2028.",
         "Remember, Trump can never run again. Both 2018 and 2022 were disappointments for Republicans. Trumpism has failed at the ballot box when Trump isn\u2019t on the ballot. It would be suicidal for the party as a whole to implement unpopular policy.",
         "I'm in Texas and I'm gonna do my part with you boss. The main problem is the liberals didn't vote this year despite the well run Harris/Walz. So, how are we going to get them to turn out during a \"gap\" year.",
         "He seems clearly on pace to get more votes, not the same",

         "I don\u2019t think they\u2019re Dems but rather people who dislike Trump because obvious vibes and Harris/Biden because economic vibes and in their median voter brain they\u2019re basically equivalent, so they opted out of voting.\n\nThere are around 45 million registered democrats in the country (according to USAFacts.org correct me if they\u2019re wrong) but Harris got 67ish million, or over 20 million independents.\n\nI really seriously doubt that there are secretly 20 million registered democrats somewhere who forgot or didn\u2019t care about the stakes of this election.",
         "You're citing data on how many votes candidates received when California, Washington, Oregon, and Utah have not even finished counting 3/4 of their votes.\n\nJust because the election has been called does not mean we can compare a partially counted electoral result against a completely counted one and draw conclusions.",
         "Yeah I think this is important to remember. It will get lost amongst the post-election outrage for a while, but the big takeaway is that Dems failed to galvanize voters.",
         "Build the wall.",
         "Yeah like the only reason he didn\u2019t fall further is that he didn\u2019t really implement any policy besides the TCJA. It was mostly just scandal after scandal lol.",

         "My gut was that Robinson was gonna cost Trump NC and demographics were gonna cost Trump Georgia. I... I was wrong.",
         "Trump only won Michigan by 81,000 votes. The margins in some of the swing states were razor tight. So at least that's something for 2028?",

         "Not Canadian, but frankly I feel Trudeau and his ilk deserve this if it happens, after not following their promise to implement voting reform.",
         "Fortunately we have a decentralized election system that relies heavily on individual states, and many of the states that voted for Trump tonight have Democratic administrations that will continue through 2026, where they stand to gain.",
         "I would argue that assassination of a president is not a sign of a democracy that is \"alive and well.\"",
         "Politicizing the courts and the agencies makes it possible to rig an election but it is not the same as rigging an election",
         "Haha. \n\nI think we\u2019re all in denial about how close we are to quasi-authoritarian country akin to Hungary. The only thing keeping him from staying in office indefinitely is the fact that he\u2019s 78 years old. Do not count on any institution to save you. They aren\u2019t going to, and they aren\u2019t as strong as we thought they were.",
         "*It was already against the constitution for Trump to run in 2024.* How is the constitution stopping him from running in 2028?",
         "Idk, were in Texas you are but in DFW there\u2019s a lot of purple suburbs with very low turnout <10%. Dems in these areas are a reliable voting demographic and even if they\u2019re not a majority we can organize turnout to flip city council seats. We\u2019ve had a lot of success so far.",
         "Is that clear? Where do you think he\u2019s going to wind up?",
         "Sure, but then Hillary also got 65 million votes in 2016. Considering this is 8 years since then, you'd expect Kamala to get around 70 million at least when accounting for the growth in the US population, not perform similarly to Hillary.\u00a0",
         "True! Of course, you could make the argument that it\u2019s already an insane world where a president who doesn\u2019t do anything except get embroiled in scandal after scandal still has any approval rating over like 5% but I think that\u2019s a bit of low hanging fruit at this point",
         "Oh for sure. The Liberals are slimey in a way that the Dems are just not. The constant corruption scandals, not fulfilling their campaign promises for bogus reasons, and more.",
         "People often don't think of federalism as another form of separation of powers. That was a genius move by the framers.",
         "So the post world war order with Kennedy was a not a healthy democracy? \n\n\nWhat about attempted with Reagan?",
         "They aren\u2019t gonna run Trump again. They might run a Trump surrogate with Trump as VP. But they won\u2019t run Trump as the nominee. \n\nBesides the dude is gonna be really fucking old in 2028.",
         "\n>The only thing keeping him from staying in office indefinitely is the fact that he\u2019s 78 years old\n\nthat's a pretty big hard limit though",
         "I mean yes we are flirting with authoritarianism, but I\u2019d be shocked if the courts just ignored the 22nd amendment.",
         "The 14th amendment requires Congress to determine Trump was guilty of insurrection, which they didn\u2019t do. The 22nd amendment has zero daylight in it.",
         "He's running 2.3 million votes behind his 2020 totals at the current count. There's probably 8,300,000 outstanding votes in california alone. Trump needs to marginally clear 25% on those votes to pass his 2020 totals. His current vote share in california is 40%, and he won 34% of california in 2020.\n\nSeems quite likely california, alone, is going to push trump over 2020. This doesn't factor in Washington, Oregon, or Utah, all less than 70% counted.\n\nAlaska, Arizona, Maine, Nevada, all still many votes left to be counted.\n\nIt blows my mind people are actually referencing vote totals right now.",
         "I think 2020 was a fluke because everyone* ever blamed Trump for COVID. Also at the time, there wasn\u2019t much bad stuff to say about Biden, \u201cremember the Obama years, his VP is running against the guy who effed up COVID.\u201d That\u2019s how you get such a high turnout.\n\nNow, there is bad stuff to say about Biden and Harris, and to most Americans, inflation is just as bad (arguably worse) than \u201cemails.\u201d",
         "The motive of Garfield's assassin was feeling undercompensated, according to the norms of American democracy at that time, for effort he had put into getting Garfield elected. His motivation was directly tied to the spoils system and its influence on American democracy. What was Oswald's motivation? And Hinckley's attempt had nothing to with politics. He he was suffering from untreated mental illness and trying to impress a girl.",
         "Who\u2019s the \u201cthey\u201d that has more power than the President? The RNC? Trump controlled. The Republicans in Congress? Trump controlled",

         "Who controls them won't matter. The point is, Trumpism relies on Trump. Surrogates will always exist, same happened with Reagan. People will claim they will enact all Reagan/Trump policies, but really, it'll be absorbed into the GOP mantra with everything else.",
         "The Supreme Court has ruled against Trump in election cases. They are very conservative, but don\u2019t owe Trump anything. I don\u2019t see them ripping up the constitution for him.",
