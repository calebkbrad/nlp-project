         "if this sub is seriously pedeling the idea that kamala lost beacuse she is a woman, I do not understand how they believe a gay candidate will win.",
         "Pete would easily be my personal choice. I\u2019d kill for a Buttigieg/Kelly ticket. But this country isn\u2019t ready for a woman, let alone a gay man. \n\nEven if he is wildly qualified, shits all over bad-faith Fox interviewers, has strong policy positions, and is the most eloquent speaker on the left since Obama\u2026. dude is gay and the black/latino vote would look even worse than it did last night.",
         "We kept Biden in the basement in 2020 we can keep Pete in the closet in 2028",
         "Trump is going to fuck it up so bad the Democrat Party could run a rock and it will win.",
         "If you all are seriously behind Pete for president then you deserve to lose in 2028.\n\nHe talks like a politician. And as we've seen that is a BAD BAD thing. People are over the typical politician mannerisms and branding. Not to mention there's no chance the electorate is voting for a gay guy. You'll lose worse than yesterday.\n\nDems need a white guy that doesn't come off as fake or scripted. Needs to be able to crack jokes and not act professional like Trump. ALL that matters is vibes.",
         "If the economy is anything like it is right now a mute, wet paper bag would wipe the floor with Pete in 2028.",
         "Andy Beshear! \n\nMight have been the candidate this year, if joe had let us have a primary.",
         "He's short and gay.",
         "i love Pete and i no longer want him to run for president because the country doesn't deserve him",
         "Kamala lost because she was tied to the Biden Admin as VP. Pete is transport secretary. And he also talks like a politician, which people clearly have shown to hate at this point. \n\nI genuinely think it has to be someone else.",
         "Pete would be a grail president but he would not win in a general election at this moment. The Republican candidate would have to be very unsavory and the economy would likely have to be depressed going into the election. His time was 2020. The country is too homophobic right now and although he is smart and has an answer for everything he doesn\u2019t exude the archetypal masculine energy of Biden, Obama, Clinton, etc. If he were to become president he would have to be vice president first and then participate in an open primary.",
         "I like Pete a lot but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s viable as a general election candidate, and I don\u2019t think it particularly has anything to do with him being gay. Mayor of South Bend, which is a college town. Then secretary of transportation, where I think he did important and mostly good work, but in a debate someone like Vance could easily pin the sorry state of America\u2019s transportation infrastructure on him. His resume is thin for the presidency.",
         "I don't think he could win the presidency. But get his ass into the Senate or something.",
         "Apparently people here have learned nothing.\n\nLooking forward to more hand-wringing in 2028 when the corporate empty suit candidate appointed by DNC superdelegates loses again",

         "This isn't meant as a positive, but Pete doesn't present as a gay man to most people. He doesn't fit the outdated stereotypes some people have, and this probably has more leeway. Plus he served so it's harder to mock him.",
         "Because someone being gay and in authority doesn't remind them of their mother telling them what to do.",
         "A black man completely blew his opponent out of the water, the gender seems to be a larger obstacle",
         "He could maybe pull it off if he was really funny",
         "Because - unfair though it may be - female politicians face a severe charisma tax in the eyes of the average American which straight-presenting gay men do not. People don't dislike Kamala because of some explicit misogyny - they're (mostly) not going into the voting booth like \"ugh, I could never vote for a woman\" - they just subconsciously find her less likable.",
         "Because the gay is not a woman. America is more misogynist than it is homophobic.",
         "Believe it or not, despite experiencing discrimination, the type of discrimination gay men face is different from the discrimination women face. Gay men don't get asked whether or not they need help plugging in their keyboards at work.",
         "I don't think Kamala lost because she is a woman, although I think it definitely hurt her, I think she lost because of inflation, that's the beginning and the end of it. People didn't care that Trump is a racist felon, they believed for no logical reason that he had a button that magically made groceries cheaper and he pressed it and Democrats refuse to press it. That's it.",
         "Blaming the loss on Kamala being a woman is just shock-induced cope.",
         "It's because his height",
         "Yeah I don\u2019t get it. I like Pete a lot, but he\u2019s not getting my primary vote because he\u2019d likely get smacked in the general.",
         "The key to Pete isn't that he is a man (although it might help), but that he has been working his ass off showing up in places where your typical democrat isn't.\n\nAnyone that wants to run successfully in 2028 should be famous, or working hard at becoming well known.",
         "Wdym Pete is straight. That's just a lie people make up to be mean to him",
         "Kamala did terribly in 2015 and 2019 primaries. I don't know what that was due to, but the fact remains she was unpopular",
         "Yeah, sad but true.",
         "Is that what happened in 2020 when we bit our nails for 3 days waiting for the mail ins to flip the swing states?",
         "Yeah and then lose the midterms immediately after",
         "In other words, a 2020s Bill Clinton, saxophone and all.",
         "I mean I think the point is that Pete would be a great choice if he was straight and slightly racist, not that Pete is actually a good choice.",
         "I think he moved to Michigan, so he\u2019ll probably run for something else here before long.",
         "Every. Time.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/75acuywdyczd1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5cc5f85a7d29130fb7e69ffb496d985546e404db",
         "Yes, for the love of God stop floating Pete. Another McKinsey ghoul, no thanks",
         "And ironically this was his downfall among leftists.\n\nI fucking swear progressives wanted him to show up to a debate in full drag makeup with a collar and leash.",
         "He will present as a gay man the moment there is a picture of him showing affection to his husband.",
         "I hate to have to say these things, beacuse they are terrible but are you out of your mind? \n\nWhite gay couple adopting black children? His boyfriend having the accent? That one won't even have to be exploited by republicans, people will sneer from their own initiative. The times they hold hands? etc etc\n\nAgain I detest to say these things but many will look at that and the thought going through their head is \"what a load of sissies\" and as much as you hate it, if you know how people think, you kbow it to be true.",
         "Pete is what the more moderate but still slightly homophobic Republicans say they want gay people to be like, they want them to not make it \"their whole identity\", to keep in the bedroom, etc and they're fine with it. I've seen a surprising amount of conservative people be fans of his.",
         "Obama was legendary charismatic though. Literally the most talented Democrat in appealing to people since at least JFK.\u00a0\n\n\nNot that Kamala is bad, she's as good as you'd expect a qualified Democrat candidate to be.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nBut I wonder if a second black man could become president and so on without being just as good as Obama.\u00a0",
         "I think assigning the loss to gender is just an attempt to avoid self-reflection.",
         "Black men got the vote before white women.  Gender is definitely the larger obstacle.",
         "I'm goana be honest, I don't think gender was the reason this election was lost, \n\nbut if you can't understand the difference in palatability between voting a charismatic black man and a homosexual for some people, I do not know what to tell you.",
         "Isn't there a world of difference between Obama and Harris re: political acumen.",
         "Exactly my thoughts. A hilarious gay could do work.",
         "Nope America is incredibly homophobic as well",
         "fuxk no it isnt, get out from under the rock you've been living in.",
         "A lot of Americans including myself tell themselves that the gay *is* a woman, as a loophole to justify whatever sex act we are doing with another man",
         "Beacuse heterosexual men are not trying to fuck other men.",
         "Pretending like it\u2019s not a factor is silly",
         "I definitely don't want to blame her being a woman.\n\nBut the *turnout* numbers... people are pointing to demographics that Trump did better with blah blah...\n\nBut the pie shrunk... where did those... what is it... 10million(?) voters go in 4 years?",
         "Pretending misogyny is not part of the democratic retraction is also cope. Twice we've run women against Trump, twice they've lost. Once we ran a white man against Trump, and he won.",
         "Is it really a stretch to suggest that a large number of Americans are slightly sexist, even if they're not consciously aware of it? Just as a product of growing up in western culture?",
         "There's definitely no shortage of height-supremacists out there.",
         "Pete has slowly won over many people, and the response in the primary was due to the need to close ranks around Sanders. They are less and less problematic, so going into 2028 he can have a resurgence.",
         "I am once again asking that we stop pandering to leftists. They hate us and will not vote for us unless the democratic resurrects Vladimir Lenin and runs him 2028",
         "Loled hard at this",
         "Don't threaten me with a good time.",
         "You are starwmanning leftists lol",
         "Americans were googling if Biden dropped out, so they are dumb. \n\nAlso it's about their emotional response to who they see not the actual facts..",
         "Clinton was just as charismatic as Obama. Hell, his approval rating went UP during the Lewinsky scandal.",
         "I would have loved to see (any) Obama run against Trump, he is arguably the best orator ever.",
         "People are pattern noticers. Even if you personally believe the race was lost because of fundamentals that any Dem would've also suffered from, the base might be more hesitant to nominate a woman in the future because all they see is the common denominator",
         "mexico just elected a jewish woman. the president of serbia is a lesbian and the president of slovakia is a gay man. neither of them can get married. i dont know why this is a us-specific issue.",
         "It absolutely isn't the only reason and everything should be looked at nothing brushed off including this, because it was absolutely a huge part. This is self reflection Democrats thought running a female could help bring women out to vote, that mindset should be looked at. Harris didn't manage to improve on the female vote while bleeding male voters. It's not just that men don't want a woman, it seems woman or at least the ones who wouldn't be voting for the Democrat anyways don't care about the gender. There's no upside to running a female candidate in today's America, only downside from men.",
         "You have to consider though what regular voters see. They\u2019re going to see that we\u2019ve ran two female candidates and lost both times. It might not even be true, but the perception is there that we lose with women candidates.\u00a0",
         ">Black men got the vote before white women.\n\n\nSorta...? I mean technically yes, but for most black men in practice? * Waves in Jim Crow *",
         "It\u2019s a factor, I would never say it\u2019s the single reason. But if you\u2019re going to point out the charisma then we should acknowledge that it\u2019s easier for men to be considered charismatic than women in this world.",
         "username checks out",
         "It's infantilizing and demeaning, and I'm not surprised you don't understand this outside the lens of courtship.",
         "14 million based on currently available numbers.\n\nTrump got 3 million fewer votes this time around, he actually did not do better.",
         "dude, MEXICO has a female president, not only that, the conservative party of mexico fielded a female candidate\n\n  \nhow can you say that misogyny is a factor when it clearly wasnt in mexico?",
         "Right, and the right wing media machine is going to draw as much attention to the fact he has gay as possible. Random scandals about his relationship (that aren't facially about being gay, but are bullshit and meant draw attention to the fact he is gay). Similar to how the Republicans would associate Dukakis with black people by just showing their proximity.",
         "Reminds me, [Iowa caucus-goer tries to change vote after learning Pete Buttigieg is gay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mV1CkKDWUeI)",
         "I did not know that but that is hilarious. This country just hates women, huh.",
         "Trump considered running in 2012, it was a possibility.",
         "Hillary had a pretty good economy going into 2016 and she lost for many of the same reasons Kamala did. White men (and to a lesser extent women) don\u2019t want a woman as Commander in Chief. It\u2019s ridiculous, but anyone who voted for Joe and didn\u2019t vote for Kamala or Hillary needs to be held accountable.",
         "oh absolutely\n\nBut I still wouldn't jot it down as the reason why she lost.",
         "I don't see how anybody perceives Trump as charismatic. Harris actually had really good events, people were hyped, and she was able to energize the crowd. I know a lot of people who never saw a rally by Trump or Harris and just base their knowledge on hearsay. Harris still has the stigma of being uncharismatic although she proved this wrong. She is relatable, comes from a working-class family, actually listens to people, is funny, and her laughter is contagious - though for no apparent reason it became controversial (I can only identify sexist reasons for this criticism). I've heard many people say she has no clear plan, but that's because they never watched her speeches and just believed the narrative that she has no plan whatsoever. Also, she is probably one of the most competent people we've considered for president - with experience in the current administration, as a senator, and as AG of San Francisco. There is just no rational explanation for why she lost. Sometimes the electorate just makes collectively stupid decisions. The GOP worked hard for years to undermine the democratic process and to brainwash the population. Harris did nothing wrong; actually, she ran a great campaign in this short period. What is there to criticize?",
         "Why don\u2019t I know that? No for real why wouldn\u2019t I know that, when did I say that it wasn\u2019t demeaning or infantilizing? You are missing the point.",
         "Yeah I agree... and to clarify, I'm referring to people building a narrative about how he 'did better' proportionally with various demographic groups than previously. \n\nWhere I happen to think that you can explain it better by just cutting more than 10 million people off the top and then measuring the proportions of what's left.\n\nI'm far more interested in understanding why so many just stayed home this time.",
         "And if the Republicans had nominated Haley she would have outperformed Trump.\n\nThe first woman President will be a Republican. That's not in question at this point.",
         "Yeah, and Obama being elected proved anti-black racism isn't real.",
         "Gee perhaps the fact that we aren't  Mexico",
         "Gonna be so many \"secret gay lover\" stories.",
         "Same thing happened with candidate Trump and the pussygrab tape",
         "I wish he did because I know for a fact he doesn't beat Obama in 2012",
         "WI & MI picked female Dem senators (one is a lesbian) + Trump. NV may be in a similar boat TBD. Similar stuff at the House level. Clearly there's more nuance than women = bad candidates for these voters.",
         "It's not \"the\" reason, just \"a\" reason. She didn't over perform Biden on women, but bled men compared to him.",
         "A Republican woman would win easier, but GOP might not nominate one",

         "It's not crazy, it's a trend that's been going on for a long time. It was silly of Democrats to believe that brown person = Democrat here in Texas (and yes that was a very common belief around 2004-2008, that as Texas became less white it would become bluer).",
         "All she needed to do to win was a) throw Biden under the bus and talk shit about Bidenomics and b) explain why and how she would do things differently.\n\nThen when in office not change anything because Bidenomics was working and just needed more time for that to sink in.  \n\nSo, in short, just tell them what they want to hear. Lie to them.  Fuck it, right?  They apparently love it.  Give em what they want.",
         "I know it's still extremely early, but any plausible explanations as to why, given Trumps obvious disdain for Hispanics? Or does the obvious empty pandering (\"I love Hispanics!\") explain it?",
         "It becomes less crazy when you realize that this sudden shift began in 2020. Back in 2016, Hillary Clinton won by a very comfortable margin of 79.12%. In 2020, only 52.06% voted for Biden. Looking at the numbers, it seems that the reason comes down to an increase in turnout for Trump since roughly the same number oof people voted blue in both elections for this county.",

         "The poor descendents of poor immigrants tend to feel the affects of inflation the most and vote in reaction to that, news at eleven",
         "As a Kamala voter this doesn't shock me. Illegal immigration is the #1 political rat poison issue that killed the Democrats this cycle. Yeah inflation hurt worse but it's not like Biden can just wave the anti inflation magic wand so they had to take that one on the chin. There's not much they could have done about that but there was a hell of a lot they could have done to keep from getting annihilated on the issue of border security. Crying about how you can't do anything on the border because the mean Republicans won't let you pass a weak border bill that no one was enthusiastic about is just awful political leadership. There's a reason why this was the major talking point Trump and Vance tried to harp on during the debates. Their campaign knew how shitty the optics were for Kamala and they capitalised on that. Biden sent 1500 troops to the border for about 3 months in 2023 when title 42 was about to expire. That's the type of thing he should have been doing from day one, except it should have been 15,000 troops there permanently. I don't want to hear about how that's \"bad policy\" or \"not the correct solution to the border problem\" or whatever. Who cares? Even if it's not a perfect solution the point is that it's a solution. Sometimes you need to take a populist view of these issues and do things purely for the sake of demonstrating strength and decisiveness. Doing basically fuck all on the border for four years and letting crossings skyrocket was such an insane optics fumble. In terms of political damage it was equivalent of Trump's awful covid response that cost him the 2020 election.",
         "But it looks like Trump pretty much got the exact same amount of votes he did in 2020 with those cities with maybe a few extra thousand votes here and there, it\u2019s just that a lot of democrats or people who vote democrat sat out this election which makes it seem like a lot of place shifted right.",

It didn\u2019t matter who was running on the republican side, who people vote for reflects their day to day opinion of the world.

Things right now are not OK for most. \n\nI am not saying that their assessment is correct that the Democrats were to blame for these issues, but a democrat president was in power during this time. We have flashbulb memories. In voters eyes, Kamala would just have been a continuation. People being flabbergasted that other people would vote for a felonious, lying criminal don\u2019t realize that many are willing to overlook personal defects if their current situation is poor.

      "title": "This election wasn\u2019t lost because of your least favorite interest group",
      "text": "In the coming days, dozens of post-mortems will be published trying to dissect why the Democrats lost. Fingers will be pointed everywhere, and more likely than not everyone will look for a myriad of reasons why the Democrats lost, be it certain issues, campaigns strategies, constituencies defecting, etc. This election will be viewed as a catastrophic failure of the Democratic Party on brand with 2004. Every commentator across the political spectrum will claim that had the Democrats just gone with their preferred strategy, then Kamala would be President-elect right now.\n\nI think it\u2019s safe to say that all of that is reading too much into it. The Democratic Party was in complete array. Progressives, liberals, moderates, centrists, whoever, fell in line behind Kamala as the candidate. Fundraising was through the roof, the ground game had a massive amount of energy and manpower in it, and Democratic excitement was palpable.\n\nBy all accounts, the Democrats showed up and showed out for this election across the board. Unfortunately, that isn\u2019t enough. It kept the bottom from falling out like in 1972 or 1980, but the vast majority of independent and swing voters broke for the Republicans. A majority of the nation, for the first time in 20 years, put their faith in the governance of the Republican Party.\n\nThe median voter exists in an odd, contradictory vortex of mismatched beliefs and priors that cannot be logically discerned or negotiated. You just have to take them at their word. If they say they don\u2019t like inflation, it\u2019s because they believe that Biden is making the burgers more expensive. No amount of explaining why Trump\u2019s economic policies are terrible, or why Biden\u2019s policies were needed to avoid a massive post-COVID recession, or why they\u2019re actually making a paycheck that offsets inflation, will win them over. \n\nIn view of this, it was probably impossible for Kamala to win. She secured the Democratic base, made crossover appeals, and put forward some really good policies. And it worked. Her favorables are quite good, higher than Trump\u2019s, and it\u2019s obvious that she outperformed whatever Biden was walking into. Her campaign had flaws, certainly, but none nearly as obvious and grievous as Trump\u2019s. \n\nKamala being perceived as too liberal didn\u2019t matter. The Democrats being too friendly to Israel (or not friendly enough) didn\u2019t matter. Cultural issues didn\u2019t matter. Jill Stein didn\u2019t matter. Praising Dick Cheney didn\u2019t matter. The reality of the American economy didn\u2019t matter. If issue polling is correct, even immigration didn\u2019t really matter, and is mostly viewed as a proxy for the economy. \n\nWhat mattered was that 67% of voters thought the economy was doing poorly, in spite of most of them thinking that their own financial situation was fine. Voters want to see a low price tag on groceries, a DoorDash fee of $10, and a 3,500 sq. ft. house on the market for $250k, even if it means 10% unemployment and low wages for workers. Of those things, they associate it most with Trump, as much of a mirage as that is, and were willing to accept everything else for the chance to have that back. This election isn\u2019t a victory of all of Trumpism necessarily, or even a complete failure of the Democrats. It\u2019s a reminder of the priorities of the voters that will decide the election, in spite of how good your campaign was, or how economically sound your actually policies were. There\u2019s a hell of a lot that people will look past in order to have a cheap burger again.\n\nIf there is a failure, it\u2019s that Democrats spent to long believing that there could ever be a return of civility and normality. There was a clear and evident reluctance to use the full power of the state against the insurrectionists and crooks, chief among them Donald Trump. Biden thought that he could restore the soul of the nation and get people to respect and value the unwritten rules of politics that have guided us through the current liberal era. As it turns out, voters don\u2019t even care for the written ones.\n\nDon\u2019t blame the progressive, or the liberal, or the centrist Democratic voter. This election wasn\u2019t really on them. They voted. They probably donated, walked the blocks, or did some phone banking. They did what they were supposed to. If liberalism is to weather the coming storm, it will need the tent to stay intact, readjust, and come back stronger for 2026 and 2028. ",

Dems spent trillions on a progressive wishlist. There's no way that Dems didn't contribute just a little bit to inflation. Not just that, but what spending they did do had to be talked down to please Joe Machin.\n\nThen there was this rethinking of traditional antitrust laws where instead of believing in the consumer welfare standard, progressives believed that breaking up companies for the curse of being too big should take precedence.

         "Trump made massive gains among Latino, Black, and union voters. Kamala's campaign had very clear blind spots when it came to demographics she needed to win on Election night. So much of her campaign focused on how terrible Trump was/is, combined with the usual anti price-gouging and \"he'll cut taxes for rich people, I'll cut taxes for **you**\" palaver. Trump's campaign tried as hard as they could to tie Harris to the Biden administration to take advantage of anti-incumbency sentiment. **That** is the message the Harris campaign needed to repudiate, and you can't sit there and tell me with a straight face that they did a good job in that department.\n\nWas she correct about Trump being awful? Yes. Did she hammer it effectively? Yes. But in the end, was she telling people what they already knew? Also yes. The campaign focused on giving people reasons not to vote for Trump, and less on giving people reasons to vote for her. That doesn't work with an electorate easily swayed by populism.\n\n> The theory for why Harris should focus on bread-and-butter issues instead of Trump\u2019s autocratic ambitions is simple: Nine years after Trump launched his first presidential campaign, voters already know what they think about him. And if undecided voters still aren\u2019t convinced that Trump is an authoritarian menace, they probably can\u2019t be persuaded on that point. After all, Trump-curious voters remember Democrats issuing apocalyptic warnings in 2016, yet did not personally suffer nor witness any political repression during his time in office. To the contrary, they tend to recall life under Trump as utterly normal \u2014 at least, before the worldwide pandemic for which, in their view, he had little responsibility.

Obama won Iowa, Ohio, and Florida twice; won Indiana once; and almost won Missouri. Those are non-college educated White voters he dominated with. Dems had Senators in Louisiana, Arkansas, and South Dakota. What did they do? They let in people who were culturally conservative. \n\nOn fiscal issues Obama thought it was okay to be a billionaire or a millionaire, he just thought they should pay more taxes. He praised tech companies for their innovation and was on good terms with Elon Musk. He didn't have a problem with Sheryl Sandberg being influential with a sliver of Dems like a lot of progressives do. He didn't have a problem with Wall Street execs working in his administration, as long as they worked toward his vision. He didn't start fights with groups just because he thought they were \"too powerful\" because that's stupid.\n\nAll of that is why modern day progressives hate Obama - he didn't cosplay as a warrior. Biden and the Dems did not do any of the above and it made them nothing but enemies, ran Democratic allies towards the right, and got them no concrete wins. There's a good chance the Biden's legacy will be erased in the next Congress. And for what? Because progressives want a more ideologically pure party?

         "Thats because POTUS does have limits on tariff authority.\n\nThere are three ways they can do it without congress getting involved.\n\n* Get commerce to find a national security reason for a specific tariff. This allows single goods tariffs to protect single industries (eg steel) but takes a year if there are no legal challenges.\n* Decare an emergency. Tariffs can be challenged if they don't relate to the emergency.\n* Tarif is in response to unfair trading practices. USTR investigation is required and only allows targeting of a single country.\n\nFor the broad authority Trump wants congress either has to do it themselves or give him authority. Congress is not going to give him authority because then democrats can use it too. No idea what the votes will be like with congress trying to do it but im not sure its passable.\n\nThere are many things he can mess with easilly but most of the things he has been talking about are things that would take two terms even with full support of congress. The deportations thing he is obsessed with he can't alter parole (IE intern them) for those already granted it and they can't be deported without a hearing which currently has a 5 year backlog.\n\nEven with SCOTUS the way it is the legal challenges for most of the stuff he wants to do would take more than 4 years to resolve. The Texas trick they have been using for headlines can also be used in other districts to slow walk issues like this until his term is up. The Thomas & Trump view of president kings hasn't been true since FDR, unless congress becomes productive again, they are not going to be removing barriers here.\n\nEven the Ukraine funding Democrats simply need to find enough Republicans to support a Ukraine funding bill to bypass him.\n\nTBH I am way more concerned about the executive agencies then anything he has talked about on the campaign trail. Nutritional guidelines cycle has happened to fall over an election this time with the next round due to be published end of next year (5 year cycle) which informs a huge number of programs (school lunches, prison food etc).

All of this is anecdotal but the culture in El Paso isn't so different from the rest of the country. More people are bilingual here and d\u00eda de los muertos is celebrated here moreso than other parts of the country. But the culture here is also very American.

Not between white and non-white.\n\nThe policy issues regarding brown people/Latinos aren't about Latinos who are US citizens. They're about undocumented immigrants who are marginalized based on their immigration status rather than their race. First generation Latinos are marginalized based on accent and language which is why they loved Obama. Latinos (and Asians, and all other non-black groups) who were born and raised here aren't really marginalized in any meaningful capacity. I don't think voting red is a fundamental betrayal of their social interests like it is when black people vote red. Every non-black racial group has the privilege to ignore race as a topic when deciding who to vote for. \n\nEvery non-black racial group\u2019s voting patterns is pretty much the same. Basically 50-50. Maybe 60-40. Even Arabs have that privilege. Trump won Dearborn, Michigan which is the largest Arab-majority city in America.

The hard part about NZ being an alternative is the economic aspects, not the social aspects. \n\nAlso NZ is 2/3rds the size of Japan.

His current vote share in california is 40%, and he won 34% of california in 2020.\n\nSeems quite likely california, alone, is going to push trump over 2020.

Just like Romney got a couple points closer than McCain did because of economic dissatisfaction, so does Trump now. Problem is that the polls were dead on, and that couple points to the right is the whole ballgame. It\u2019s just a very mundane, old-school, shift-against-the-party-in-charge race that happens all the time in both directions. But this time he\u2019s the beneficiary.\n\nDems just won a \u201cjust punish the party in charge\u201d election 4 years ago - and it obviously wasn\u2019t because everyone loved us. It\u2019s just quite sad that people don\u2019t seem to care who personally would be doing the punishing. The real tragedy is the banality of it all - watch trends just snap back toward us in 2 years as *shock*, Trump\u2019s agenda turns out to be deeply unpopular. Which sounds like a good thing, but really is the entire problem - he\u2019s now just seen as a normal politican, subject to all the same ebbs and flows as any other, which is an enormous institutional failure.",

Trump had months of proving his viability and favorability over his challengers, especially by winning the primaries without any notion of debating them.

Well, that goes back to the perception that Biden was going to die before this summer. I don't think any cosplay by Kamala, Shapiro, or Kelly as being the reassuring auntie/uncle to this demographic was going to change that. \n\nAmerican voters prefer lies and hyperbole over critical thinking, and I think I agree more now, in hindsight, that Trump should have won his second term where the Pandemic would have lingered longer and the dreaded inflation everyone's crying about would be worse thanks to Trump's fumbling at fixing the supply chain.\n\nThe Democrats were in no fit form to grab the post pandemic ramifications by the horns and come out looking like champs.

Hindsight is 2020, but Biden could have picked a VP that had a much broader appeal, and spent the last 4 years grooming them to take the helm of the party. \n\nNothing against Harris, I think she would have made a good president, and I voted for her, but the outcome here really isn\u2019t that surprising. It shows how tone deaf party leadership is. If the goal for Biden\u2019s VP was to eventually win the presidency, why did we pick a quasi-progressive from San Francisco?",

At the state level the bluer the area is the worse housing inflation was, so locally dem voters are fucking furious.\n\nI dont believe there is anything any dem candidate could have done, because disavowing bidens garbage strongly enough to get any standing on the issue would have been widely rebuked by the party and the dem base.\n\nThe problem is we know that dems being \"better than the alternative\" isnt enough, they have to actually be good, and the best this administration did was somewhat right the ship",

I think the big takeaway needs to be that Democrats need to stop relying on policy wonks to run their campaigns, and start getting marketers. It's clear that the messaging has become more and more inward and is not connecting with the masses. They need to realize that the demographics they're going for have different priorities and they need to discuss those priorities head on i.e. economic concerns over social concerns. It's clear from the propositions that have passed or nearly passed that Democrat ideas are popular, but they're messaging is just not on point.

They either explicitly favored Trump or chose stood idle against attempts to deceive voters with misinformation.**  They did it because there were zero consequences for them doing it if Harris won, and they knew Trump would come after them if they didn't & he won.  This gave Trump an immense advantage in terms of reaching voters, and in terms of misinformation which worked to support his campaign.  Russia hasn't been idle, nor have other foreign adversaries, and there's the usual storm of purely domestic misinformation. \n\nThat gave Trump an immense advantage that no amount of outreach by Democrats could overcome.     \n\nX openly backs Trump and Musk has played any and every game to favor him.  The NY Times sanewashed Trump and constantly cut down Biden and then Harris. Meta refused to take action against election related misinformation on social media.

Trump absolutely doesn\u2019t care about the process and neither do his supporters but unfettered political power also doesn\u2019t often lead people to amazing decision making. It is possible that over the next 4 years trump just burns out the party as the promises he made can\u2019t be kept.

While by some traditional measures, that promise has been kept, there are a lot of highly visible ways it hasn't. In the US, this is notably evident in the crisis in the cost of housing and the related crisis of urban blight - highly visible homeless populations in most major cities make it hard to feel like one is living in a neoliberal utopia when one goes about one's daily business. These daily reminders really eat away at people's confidence in the system as a whole.\n\nSo what to do about all this, exactly? I think I know where we need to get, but I don't have any idea of how to get there.\n\nWe need a plan to build socially progressive institutions that work. We need the plan to be simple enough that low-education voters will understand it, and we need it to be credible enough that low-trust voters will believe in it. We need to inspire hope for a prosperous future. We need to encourage people to see themselves not as ruggedly individual, but as important and valued members of a great society.",

The thing is, people love fighters when they fighters is one of theirs! Fighters benefit from proving resilience, taking blows as much as giving them. Trump built up a tremendous amount of loyalty and inspiration from taking blows people like Jeb and DeSantis could not.  But this is where them Dems run into another issue, their coalition is too diverse to have a fighter that resonates with everyone, and thus in turn it scares other coalition members who fear the fighter will unify their party under one faction such as Trump did.\n\nI think Dems have to learn from the 90s and let progs take the L and spend some time in the woods eating the scraps they get. Some decent ideas will matriculate up, but bad ideas that got taken too seriously need to be purged. The worst things Dems learned from obergefell v. hodges is thinking that all prog ideas are morally ascendant and those who disagree have to be shamed into compliance.

         "> but it does indicate a deeper problem.  \n\nAll of this has been stewing for decades.\n\nA convicted felon who runs on populist policies got elected, twice.  Too bad there will likely be zero self-reflection or accountability among the third-way devout; likely only finger-pointing at progressives, in spite of rust belt America being depressed for ~60 years while wealth continues to move into the pockets of financial institutions.  Conservatives are idiots for thinking Republicans will fix it, and liberals delude themselves to believe that Democrats defeating Trump will solve their underlying problems without addressing the root of the discontent.\n\n> \u201cOnly a crisis - actual or perceived - produces real change. When that crisis occurs, the actions that are taken depend on the ideas that are lying around.\"\n>\n>--Milton Friedman\n\nNeoconservatives and neoliberals need to reflect on the civil consequences of the capital-poltical machines they have created instead of pointing fingers at everyone else.  The macro-economic landscape is not indicative of the personal financial health of people and their families.  On top of that, you have the political leverage of wealth that disgusts working people.  \n\nWealth has too much political leverage. People think it's because these people can buy politicians, and that is certainly true, but the actual leverage, if you're big enough, is the economy itself and therefore the stability of the nation. This is what makes institutions like JP Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, et al. and the people behind them, almost untouchable institutions in terms of criminal liability; they pay fines over and over again, but the fines are merely the cost of doing business and are mostly there as window dressing to make the public believe we live in a rule-governed society, and not a tiered plutocracy.\n\nThink about the knock-on effects of this and what happens to civic/cultural standards like \"Impartial Justice\" when the economic system and power structures needs to persist for the sake of national stability and what sort of leverage that creates for those that have the capital to disrupt the status quo if they, their wealth, or way of life is ever threatened; there is no accountability or meaningful consequences.  These institutions invest in and prop up the public and private pension system, 401Ks, education funding, health insurance, the US bond market, etc.  Its what enables the criminal behavior without fear of consequence that disgusts working Americans and this sentiment has been around since and before the 1889 Johnstown Flood.\n\nThe financialization of our economy has creates and cements oligarchical control/influence over the judicial and legislative systems; what little effect regulatory agencies have is dwarfed by immense personal economic incentives to not enforce the rule of law via the revolving door between regulatory agencies and industry. You cannot have an unbiased justice system if systemically important companies (by themselves or via their organizational owners) lever their economically valuable position to skirt laws or any sort of criminal liability. It undermines democracy and creates 2-tiered justice, which breeds and pressurizes political cynicism, depressed apathy, and anger, ultimately erupting into violence among the voting electorate. All of which should sound very familiar to the US and wavering western democracies.\n\nThe third-way has damaged democracy more than most care to admit, solely because of its inability to rein in abuses of political leverage wrought from capital.  Instead we brag that coastal blue states subsidize heartland red states, without any reflection on what happened post 1960 in those local communities.",

         "Great article, especially this;\n\u201cThe electoral tent is too narrow. Setting aside the question of toxically unpopular progressive positions, Democrats just have too many stances that are considered non-negotiable. Democrats\u2019 formal campaigns emphasized abortion rights, health care, and a light smattering of left-populism (federal price gouging law, anyone?) on top of an upbeat, inclusive cultural positioning. But if you want to be seen as a party that\u2019s obsessed with abortion rights and health care, then you have to welcome people who agree with you about that stuff as allies, even if they disagree about other stuff, not do purges over student loan reform.\u201d",
         "I think Iglesias gets at a good point. Policy, even if its good, goes no where because of standards that the average american can't even comprehend. \n\nIts all vibes. What vibe is it and how far can it spread. Inflation generates bad vibes not because prices go up, but because everyone SEES prices go up. Unemployment is a bad vibe, but not everyone experiences it. People getting stimulus checks was a good vibe because everyone got it, targeted assistance is a good vibe but it doesn't reach the whole population.\n\nTrump had bad vibes in 2020 because of Covid. That vibe physically spread to everyone and a lot of people lost someone they cared about. It got everyday people saying \"Yeah that wasn't good, lets not do it again\"\n\nFor a vibe to be good it needs three things: It's a benefit everyone shares, it's visible, and it's easy to communicate.  The vibe really just needs the last two and the first is really just dependent on who is broadcasting it (I.E. someones trash is another mans treasure)\n\nSo vibes are broadbased and are simple to digest. They are conversation starters, much like the weather.\n\nItems that pass the Vibe Check\n\n* Higher or lower Gas Prices\n* Higher or lower Groceries\n* Higher or lower Housing costs\n* Higher or lower Taxes\n\nItems that don't pass the vibe check\n\n* Higher or lower Wage Growth\n* Higher or lower GDP Growth\n* Higher or lower Unemployment\n* Higher or lower Student Loan Forgiveness\n\nI think you get the point. Dems are the worst at messaging because they speak in conceptual language that no one outside of their bubble uses and when they push policies its specifically targeted to a small segment of society (I.E. Student Loan Forgiveness) that just make it easier for the opposition to pit one class against the other. \n\nDems need to start talking about concrete things that everyone can relate to and understand and they need a media apparatus that is constantly talking about it on every platform that gets consumers. It's vibe economy ya'll and if we don't figure out how to use it, the republicans have shown us they already have.",

         "I just... don't agree with the idea that this is happening.\n\nThe \"not do purges over student loan reform\" is a link to an opinion piece in Slate ([here](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2023/08/marie-gluesenkamp-perez-washington-congresswoman-sold-out-democrats.html)) criticizing Marie Gluesenkamp Perez for voting with Republicans a lot. You can think it's a dumb piece. But MGP got plenty of Democratic funding, the DCCC supported her, she faced no real primary challenge... I guess when someone says \"Democrats are purging people from their ranks\" I expected a little bit more than \"a Slate columnist wrote an article.\"\n\nEven in red states and districts, there is a *lot* of tolerance amongst Democratic voters for people that don't agree with every progressive agenda item or whatever. Manchin beat back his primary challenger handily in 2018. Tester and Brown had unlimited leash to do whatever they wanted. Moderate Senators in safe blue states, where you could actually nominate someone to their left and still win, routinely demolish their primary challengers if they even have any. The only group of conservative Democrats that lost their seats to other Democrats were pro-life Democrats in districts where you didn't need to be pro-life to win, because pro-choice voters saw the Trump administration and congressional Republicans coming after abortion rights and wanted someone who would actually fight to protect that right, and knew that they could safely get that person.\n\n---\n\nOr I guess perhaps there's a difference, that this article doesn't really get at, between the *voter* tent, and the *politician* tent. Has the voter tent shrunk? I mean it obviously did this election, through a combination of people flipping to Trump and Democratic voters not showing up. And so Democrats will need to run someone who can rebuild it, win them back, etc. But has the *politician* tent shrunk? I don't think it has. And if someone comes along and says \"I can get those voters back and I'll have to make compromise X and Y to do it\", Democratic primary voters have shown basically unlimited appetite for that.",

Most Republicans have mentally walled themselves off from ever being able to fairly compare the two parties.

This is in conflict with unions/local non for profits- but it\u2019s a big reason why it\u2019s so much more expensive to live in Dem states. \n\n* It hurts me deeply- but the Biden plan to lift up the bottom quadrant of wages through full employment failed. It led to inflation- which is politically toxic. Next time in a crisis - the horrible choice has to be mass unemployment and limited stimulus. \n\n* Dems screwed up by having so much of the infrastructure projects get bogged down in years of environmental review and paperwork. Now- Republicans will get credit for the work. \n\n* Dems failed to limit the flow of asylum seekers- and it was an unpopular disaster. This was made worse by Dem states and cities not having the capability to handle migrant influx without grifting/super inefficient spending. \n\n* Biden\u2019s late exit put Kamala in a tough position. \n\n* Millennial generation seemed to have the 2007 crash as their formative political moment- and blames Republicans for it.

Jewish voters felt unsafe and started voting for the party that would actually do something about it. Meanwhile, the protesters said up front they don't consider themselves Democrats and weren't going to vote. Besides basic civil liberties, sticking up for the voters that have consistently shown up for you in the past is basic politics. A big tent is great, but certain groups just don't get along and you'll piss them both off for trying to thread the needle.\n\n2) People don't like feeling punished when they haven't done anything wrong. Most people don't shoplift, and they're tired of waiting for a clerk with a key just to get some deodorant because shoplifters are too tolerated. Families of immigrants that came here \"the right way\" and have a story of adversity don't like seeing someone else cut the line. Most people don't do drugs, and parents especially don't like missing parks because public spaces are full of used needles.\n\n3) Democrats/Progressives (of which I consider myself one btw) take certain things as a given. Some houses are being built, what if we just add zoning red tape, neighborhood character requirements, etc? The houses will still be built right?

They hold so much power that without pandering to them Democrats will lose, every time...  and similarly Trump won then over with threats if they don't back him.\n\nI don't like it, but that's where we are today.

As others mentioned Trump will be out of the picture barring an implosion of the republic, so IMO Dems need to totally retool their platform and identity to face the music. There are still actionable solutions to what ails the middle class, but Trump doesn\u2019t have them and that doesn\u2019t matter to them. I think the stench of progressivism is too much for young men and Latinos such that they would never want to associate with the Dems. How much is the identity politics war worth fighting anymore when the Dems have repeatedly lost? How can you make actual solutions appealing to moderates, young men, and non-elites when they\u2019re so liable to believe you want to destroy them? Idk, but the democrats need to learn to WIN. And need to count the cost for it.",

The strong American military presence would probably also not be welcome, and as I mentioned \u2013 no matter what certain politicians might say, that presence has been there because it's in US interests to exist.",

The only difference is he's not running as an incumbent.\n\nYou see what I'm getting at? This election wasn't about policy, and Harris wouldn't have won with better policy. That's the fools errand that the Dems have been on for the better part of the last decade - trying to find the right policies to win over moderate voters.

More likely the margin of error actually refers to the reported 95% confidence interval so 2 SD. \n\nShe fundamentally made a mistake on how to adjust for sampling error. Given HOW wrong she was she probably also got a bit unlucky but the error is so large, that she must have adjusted wrong.",

The chances of missing by that much are 2%. \n\nAnd that\u2019s only the sampling error, it assumes the sample is perfectly random with no biases at all, which simply isn\u2019t possible.\n\nSo the chances of missing were actually several times higher than that.

Poland is the only NATO country that spends more than 4% of its GDP on its military capabilities, ranking first in the alliance in terms of GDP share.\n\n>Warsaw has also been a vocal supporter of Ukraine on the world stage, campaigning for Kyiv to receive all the required weaponry to win the war that Russia had begun. It has provided Ukraine with around $3.5 billion in military aid since 2022.\n\n>On the campaign trail, Trump has repeatedly suggested that he would\u00a0[end the war](https://kyivindependent.com/trump-claims-he-could-get-zelensky-putin-to-make-peace-deal-in-one-day/)\u00a0within 24 hours if elected while refraining from sharing the specifics of his plan.

Race and identity based politics is divisive in the best of times, there\u2019s a reason why AA failed in deep blue CA.

         "Ok, first of all any talk about the Democratic Party having no future is absurd, as it is when it\u2019s the other way round and people are casually predicting the destruction of the Republican Party. Nothing is static, many many voters are captured temporarily and not permanently, and any assumptions about why they voted a certain way and continue to vote that way are misguided and over-generalising.\n\nFirst, on the Republican Party. Donald Trump is unique and unconventional, which has been incredibly beneficial to him but carries a risk when it comes to finding his successor. Republicans right now will understandably be very optimistic about the future of their party, but no matter what they think there is no concrete way for them to retain the \u2018Trump formula\u2019 in future elections. It\u2019s entirely possible that they find someone who can take over that mantle, it\u2019s also entirely possible that that person pisses their voter coalition away because they don\u2019t have the very particular type of appeal that Trump has, and aren\u2019t able to get away with the same unorthodoxies. I am not yet convinced that he has created a lasting movement.\n\nSecond, on the Democratic Party. There are multiple problems here that people have already touched on: elitism, arrogance, populism, being tied to the far left, communication etc. I want to touch on authenticity.\n\nTrump\u2019s communication is authentic. It\u2019s dishonest, but it\u2019s authentic. When you go to his rallies, watch his interviews, or read his tweets you are getting something that it is totally his own, and unique to that situation. It\u2019s messy and deranged, but it\u2019s also unfiltered and improvised. He does not have a \u2018stump speech\u2019, he has talking points but that\u2019s the extent of\nIt. Democrats are stuck in this old idea of message discipline that no longer applies, in part because Trump contrasts so heavily with that strategy that the constant repetitions and evasions become even more noticeable.\n\nKamala Harris had a major authenticity problem because she:\n\n* Avoided difficult interviews\n\n* Evaded difficult questions\n\n* Wasn\u2019t able to seamlessly segue from an uncomfortable topic into one of her talking points (See Pete Buttigieg for examples of doing this effectively).\n\n* Failed to recognise the value of non-traditional media - podcasts are how increasing numbers of people and especially young people consume information. I don\u2019t think her going on Joe Rogan would have changed the result, but ffs it\u2019s the most popular podcast in the country, with an audience that is there to be won. How can you not recognise the value in appearing on that sort of media? Additionally, you cannot leave social media to some marketing intern posting the same repetitive, boring stump speech clip from one of your rallies. No, the majority of people are not using Twitter or listening to Joe Rogan, but everyone knows people who do - you need to reach those people to control the entire online information highway (which includes work/friend/family group chats btw). Candidates need to be able to use Twitter authentically themselves, without focus grouping every bloody tweet.\n\n* Avoided the primary process (not her fault). Obama and Trump were able to come in and take control of their parties and the narrative. Harris was unable to do this, and so the election became Trump VS an avatar of the Democratic Party.",

         "I may write a whole post on this later. But the good news for Democrats is that this election was *always* going to be an uphill battle, and while Kamala Harris actually proved to have surprisingly good political instincts, she personally is a pretty weak candidate. So you can plausibly expect that a better candidate in a more favorable climate would be able to win. Biden's tenure has been awful, and him running for so long, I think, meant a lot of voters came to terms with voting for Trump back in early-mid 2024 before Harris took over [I mean, look at the search results for \"did Joe Biden drop out\"...]. The barrier was gone after that. \n\n\nThe bad [well, if you're a D operative/partisan] news is that it's clear that the GOP's new economically populist, socially conservative agenda is in fact able to win large numbers of Latino and Black voters, as well as young voters. Consider this a categorical rejection of Bidenism at the polls. In addition, Harris' strategy to try to gain more conservative/moderate leaning suburbanites largely fizzled. I think we can place the blame here on first, the fact that Harris never really committed to any conservative policies, and second, that Biden's tenure obviated a lot of good-faith that suburban white voters had in Biden to \"restore normalcy\". \n\n\nBasically there's two paths forward, but imo really only one path. The first is to abandon social progressivism and max out economic populism--the Bernie Sanders path, but with more Black/Latino appeal. The problem is, this is what the GOP is *already* doing, and they're better at it. Biden and Harris have both tried this path, Biden squeaked over the edge and Harris flopped hard. I see no reason why a future left-populist candidate would see any more success. \n\n\nThe second is to see the path forward in the white suburbs [and multiracial suburbs]. These voters are *reliable*, they're very high quality in terms of showing up to the polls, but they aren't entirely comfortable with the current Democratic agenda. So mold the agenda to fit them, along with college educated voters that increasingly make up the base of the party. I'd say that the future Democratic Party should place at its three corners social liberals/left libertarians, fiscal conservatism, and liberal internationalism. A bit like a liberal version of the old GOP. Basically:\n\n1. the \"I want gay married couples to own AR-15s on their private weed farm\" vote\n\n2. the \"my god I hate inflation and tariffs\" vote\n\n3. the \"I don't trust the GOP internationally\" vote\n\n\nCorresponding with these three, Dems should realign their messaging. Slam Trump's tariffs [get people to put Trump \"I did this\" stickers on tarriffed goods]. Pummel him on inflation and deficits. Hit him for restrictions on social issues, while saying you just want people to be free to do what they want (in the privacy of their own homes--try not to associate too much with big, open public displays, it's offputting to normie voters).  Maintain a *strong* line internationally that doesn't waffle about, try to out-muscleman Trump and support defense spending *and* diplomacy--go full Scoop Jackson. \n\n\n\nThat's in addition to some of the stuff other commenters are mentioning, like focusing more on reform and administrative improvements--govern *smarter*, not *harder*. I also think Democrats should work to literally *change the language* they use to be flashier, more provocative, and antagonistic--part of Trump's appeal is that he \"tells it like it is\". It'll also help with the male vote if your talk about \"bringing America together\" is followed by \"to sit upon a throne of the skulls of our enemies\".",

We are an increasingly low trust society. Trump has exploited this wherever possible, and where he has baggage he just does it in the open and owns it, so it almost \"cleanses\" him. It can't be nefarious if he said it on tv, right?\n\nE)don't try to appeal to people's better angels. The electorate saw trump encourage a deadly riot, and ignore helping when he could. I'm not saying Dems should also do this (you shouldn't do it because it is wrong) but don't expect the same attitudes around liberal democracy from the electorate as a whole. It's just empirically true - they didn't care enough for it to matter. Do it because it's good, don't expect it to win.\n\nI honestly don't know if that is enough to be honest. Republicans had the baggage of abortion, and it just didn't matter. Election autopsies are hard. Perhaps trump is a unique candidate that can't be replicated, I just do not know.

But they have a problem with \"Drag queen library whatever\" and \"state-funded sex changes\".\n\nThey are fine with reducing taxes for middle class and increasing taxes on the wealthy, but they have a problem with all the student loan forgiveness talk, and \"free houses for illegal immigrants\"\n\nThey are (ostensibly) fine with the \"color blindness\" approach, but have a problem with mandated DEI and overall \"woke\" vernacular (hearing progressives complain that republicans can't \"define\" woke always struck me as quite disingenuous).\n\nThey are fine with Palestine existing, but they have a problem with people going on about \"genocide\".\n\nThey are fine with people immigrating here(largely), but have a problem with what appears to amount to open borders.\n\nDon't get me wrong, we absolutely don't *abandon* liberal sensibilities or throw trans/minorities/etc under the bus, but we need to modulate on the very culture-war policies adjacent to them, and majorly moderate on the messaging around it. Don't like it? TOUGH. We can't do **anything** if we don't win. Hell, we got smoked in the popular vote even!\n\nIMO this election was more an indictment of the progressive left, NOT an explicit endorsement of MAGA far-right. I could certainly be way off base, and it could be as simple as \"trump's personality cult is unstoppable\", or \"america won't elect a woman\", or \"inflation\", or something else. But I truly think a moderate candidate from a moderate state who has always been moderate could have eked this out.",

From the *bottom* up.\n\nMaybe that's a step way too far, but /rant.\n\nAlternatively we maybe really should strongly consider trying to reform US elections (again, *locally* /  from the bottom up), and make real *attempts* to challenge and throw out the US 2-party system, and in particular the hyper-fixation on *national* level politics.\n\nBear in mind that we are in this situation *in the first place* because Trump *is* the only real (and credible) challenger to US establishment dem leadership.\n\nWhich is a massive f---ing problem given that US electoral politics tends to very reliably yo-yo between / against establishment / incumbent party leadership, and Trump is a populist wanna-be authoritarian - maybe - who has taken over one of the US's only two major parties.\n\nAnd ergo if you *do* have major beef with national-level dem leadership, you may very well end up voting *for that* for a change / rebellion against the current status quo. As we have very self evidently seen in this election. And dems - or more accurately center-left to far-left US media - tend to very regularly have their heads stuck up their own asses on a few issues, which is more or less at least *part* of how we've ended up in this particular situation / completely fucked election *(and trajectory over the past 10 years)* in the first place.\n\nIn general dems need to take a *really* hard look in the mirror, given that 1) HRC lost to trump in 2016, 2) Biden ran, and literally only won in 2020 due to a) trump, b) *generally* very strongly positive memories of biden as Obama's VP, and a desire to return to that point and style of leadership. Since then we have somehow completely 3) stopped talking about healthcare reform / public option, despite the ACA since becoming a massive (albeit very stopgap) public success, *and* how critical bloated healthcare (and in addition to that housing costs) are to US COL problems, wage gaps, *and* something that adds a massive and very (globally) inefficient burden to US businesses, and helps make US labor *even less* cost effective within certain industries.\n\nOh, and instead of *that* we had somehow apparently, in our infinite wisdom, turned the 2024 election entirely *into purely reactive issues against trump / republicans*, including abortion, 24/7 year-round coverage of the trump criminal proceedings and investigations, and so on and so forth. Oh, and initial stances on immigration + policing, that were 1) anti-trump, 2) blew up in our faces given a) the worldwide (and particularly in eg. europe) pivot away from support for liberal open-borders immigration. And b) the fact that crime, in general, *is* bad, and above all tends to actually affect ethnic minorities, and other groups of people that dems / progressives are *supposedly* fighting for.",

In 2008 he brought together college-educated White voters and racial minority voters, who are both located primarily in the major cities and their suburbs. Since then the Democrats have really consolidated the college-educated demographic, but Black and especially Hispanic voters no longer behave as homogenous voter blocks. Non-college-educated minority voters are now behaving like non-college-educated White voters. Those people have \\*always\\* been socially conservative, except for their opposition to racism. America has become less racist in the last 16 years (despite perhaps becoming more xenophobic), so opposition to racism no longer overrides other concerns for those non-college-educated racial minority voters.\n\nThere's no way the Democrats are going to abandon socially progressive policy, and shouldn't. They need to bring in another coalition partner. Ideally somebody in rural areas. I think focussing on massive economic investment in infrastructure in rural areas is the way to go. I don't think people are \\*actually\\* afraid of socialist policies, they're just afraid of their taxes benefiting \\*someone else\\* instead of themselves.

Biden saved 1 million plus pensions of union workers set to be axed by Congress. Despite this, union voters went to Trump nearly 2 to 1, even with Republicans explicitly adopting anti-union rhetoric.   \n  \nThe reality is neither block is a reliable voting block for Dems, but when Progs break off from Dems they do so inconsequentially, voting for some useless third-party candidate that won't win, whereas union voters actively boost Trump's reelection chances.",

It's expensive to build because of all the lawsuits, and regulations which make it easy for people to file these lawsuits. Democrats definitely need to find ways to streamline government.\n\nBut also it's never going to come down to one issue. Electoral politics is extremely complex. Trump is a really good campaigner and always has been. He can convince lots of people that he's on their side. He can mobilize huge numbers of people who don't normally vote. He has succeeded in growing the tent more than other Republican politicians by making huge inroads with Hispanics, union workers, the working and middle class, even urban voters in some areas. But that also makes the reality of governing very difficult, which is why his support once in office falters. It's quite similar to Obama.\n\nI think Democrats also need to do some soul searching on how they approach gender/racial/generational politics. People increasingly make electoral decisions based on social factors. Targeting women voters is inevitably going to create the perception that the party is not for men. The party also needs to resolve the tension in the coalition which was still relying on a small, but important segment of social conservatives.\n\nAlso the fact that people hate both parties so strongly right now should be a red flag.

Especially when the actual push was something so trivial for the Rs to block.\n\nWhile probably a good thing that foreign policy was ignored because holy shit has America's foreign policy been bad-bad for over a decade now. Nobody really knows if it's Biden or Sullivan who is the foreign policy idiot, but Ukraine and Iran are direct results of trying nothing and being out of ideas since the early 2000s if not earlier. The good news for the US is that those are both much more Europe problems than US problems, but it's not exactly a good look and I don't think it's a hot take that Iran and Russia are bad for the world. They might be better than Trump, but if true that's just because it's a height competition among 4 year olds. This continuing to be so bad was easily my personal most disappointing part of the Biden regime.\n\n> What are Dems supposed to do now? \n\nThat's easy. Condemn the crazies that have overtaken the national brand. Actually promote the other wing of the party to meaningful roles instead of the people who are pretty aligned with that wing of the party but more pragmatic like Biden and Harris. There's a very real world where AOC is the D nominee in 2032 or 2036, and that should be unthinkable. Quit being terrible at whipping so that your governments actually do stuff whenever they rarely get power. Don't assume that these very socially conservative minority groups are dems for life (definitely killed the campaign in Florida and Arizona). Don't push for social justice reforms that only leftists and criminal justice majors like at this point. Have sympathy about the economy instead of just crying fake news it's great (in reality it's a very bimodal economy that's the best it's ever been for the R base and notably shitty for half of the D base).\n\nAlso, just messaging. Biden was awfully quiet about how he was continuing Trump's industrial policy.  Probably because it's Trump's policy I guess, but there's no reason to let him take all the credit for near/friend shoring and moving away from pro-finance industrial policy.\n\nAnd finally, don't concede Florida. That ship might have sailed at this point, but that is way too many electoral votes in a state that shouldn't be firm R to just ignore. It wouldn't have worked out this election, but imagine how much easier this all would have been for Harris if you weren't starting from plan B and the plan A of Florida+Michigan/Pennsylvania/NC/Georgia was all it took.",

They really don't need all the pro-union policy; what they need is to not be told they are pieces of shit simply for being white men, mostly. That's literally all it would have taken. They tend toe be a vibes-based bloc and our policy towards them may have been good but our vibes towards them were toxic as fuck. At least that's my takeaway from the blue-collar people I know. Trump doesn't insult them. That's all they want: to not be treated like they're some group of oppressors that are brutally violating a bunch of oppressed people that are supposedly supposed to be their allies. Turns out people really don't like that!\n\nI don't think it's a false equivalence.

Some of their policies ever are broadly popular, but their rhetoric is not. Progressive rhetoric is massively destructive.",

         ">but like how the fuck does san Francisco have a homeless problem when California is the richest state in the country?\n\n\\*ahem\\*\n\nIt is because land values are great for the individual but a blight on society. When high paying jobs come in, land values absorb some of that growth, pushing values up. This is important because land in cities is finite and it's non-fungible. You can't take a square foot from rural Texas and drop it in San Francisco. In addition, we've largely stopped building new housing and what is built has a limit on density. The net result is that we've said b each person should have X sqft of land area in a place with extremely expensive per-sqft land values.\n\nThis plays into homelessness because there's much more demand for housing than supply and supply isn't increasing. There are just mathematically more people than houses. Some will have to go without. If you can't come up with the very expensive rents, you don't get to have a home. You live on someone's couch or in your car.\n\nThere is a comic by Alfred Twu that I think aptly summarizes the situation:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qgfyyh0alazd1.jpeg?width=3803&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6d2e418e95a9dab8e2137c51f1347492900de24c",

California can be a near utopia with a disgusting budget surplus as it was when the stock market was artficially booming and there will still be serious problems. It's just empirical fact that good governance in some particular state doesn't win elections. It's not that simple. \n\nIf anything, I think there's a **resentment** that California (as an example) is doing well when the other states aren't. People in West Virginia are clearly not thinking \"oh \nCalifornia has a **three times lower drug overdose death rate** than we do. Their policies must work \", they're just angry that the government has failed them so badly and are using their vote to lash out. People aren't reading Brookings Institute, they're going to their last child's funeral.\n\nWhen a politician says \"our policies work\" it actually makes them angrier because it's **not** working for them even though the policies are in fact working in the places they're actually being implemented. This is why Trump whose policies measurably hurt rural communities is able to reach them with the language of resentment and why the optimism of Harris and to some degree Clinton was such a massive turn-off.\n\nIf Democrats continue to think telling people how they can make their lives better will win elections, they will continue to lose.",

         "It does not make it not a BS. Today most russkies feel it\u2019s fine and dandy to torture civilians and execute POWs. Should we entertain this story too?",
         ">I can get to prison in Germany for calling cop or politician an obscene word so what.\n\nNo, you can't. At worst, you could get a fine, and you very likely won't even get that. The law in Germany against insulting someone is the equivalent of laws against jaywalking in the US.",
         "1. I think Americans would probably prefer to keep military spending the same but reprioritize for domestic defense and counter g China. The fact that European countries continue to not meet their 2% obligation is disappointing.\n\n2. I think the anti-Ukraine stuff bubbled from his base and gained his support rather than the other way around.",
         "> At worst, you could get a fine, and you very likely won't even get that.\n\nThe law clearly says \"prison up to one year or fine\". And yeah, just 2,250 euro is not \"just a fine\" in my book, not adequate at all to the doing.\n\nhttps://www.dw.com/en/german-man-receives-fine-after-insulting-politician-via-email/a-19415194\n\nIf you want to play mr. Pedantic, in Russia most people would also get a prison sentence up to 15 days or a relatively small fine for protesting Putin or being too loud against him, unless it's a recent defamation of army ofc (i.e. publicly saying Bucha happened will get you in a more serious trouble).\n\nThe point is, neither is oft and neither concerns avg. Joe's life too much, as OP suggests.",
         "1. Domestic defense, from attacks by Belize?\n\n2. I disagree, I think it's been Trump leading this for personal reasons.\n\nAnyways, I appreciate your point, you can have the last word if you wish but I think we both got our positions out :D Going to go drown my sorrows with various spirits.",
         ">The law clearly says \"prison up to one year or by fine\".\n\nPlease find me a single case of someone being sentenced to prison for, and I quote, \"calling a cop or politician an obscene word.\" I'll wait.\n\nThe prison sentence is for particularly serious cases where someone is persistently using incredibly vitriolic abuse against someone.\n\n>And yeah, just 2,250 euro is not \"just a fine\" in my book, not adequate at all to the did.\n\nI'm sorry, do you have some sort of super special defintion of the word \"fine?\" Because to literally everybody else, a fine is a monetary penalty for breaking the law.\n\nAnd yes, that particular individual was fined. People are also sometimes fined for Jaywalking. In both cases, the number of people actually prosecuted is very small. That's the point.\n\n>If you want to play mr.

Joe's life too much.\n\nI genuinely do not understand what point you're trying to make here.\n\nI didn't even say anything about Russia, I just pointed out that your portrayal of Germany's law against insults is inaccurate",
         "> Domestic defense, from attacks by Belize?\n\nIt's about attacks from unarmed Democrats, trans people and immigrants."

         "So the Jewish vote looks like it hasn\u2019t budged as much as people were fearing.\u00a0",
         "this survey had biden win catholic voters by 1. they quite obviously weren't motivated by dobbs and it seems to encompass trump's substantial gains among Hispanic voters",
         "I wonder if anyone out there ever looks at the \"protestant\" vote by denomination\n\nLike, say what is the difference between Presbyterians or Episcopalian and Baptists voters",
         "I was told Muslims were all pro-Trump tho",
         "We atheists love the D",
         "Christians swarm to the Christian Nationalist, minority religions and atheists favor dems.  Looking forward to the same breakdown in 4 years.",
         "Christians make life worse for everybody else, more news at 11.",
         "\"Other Christian\" must be Protestants who don't want to be labeled as such, or simply don't realize they are indeed protestants (eg: Non-Denominatinal evangelicals)",
         "Muslim vote didn't either; 75% of Muslims aren't Arab and like 30% are black. Dearborn isn't even majority muslim; lots of non-muslims in that city sat out and voted for stein or trump. Harris did like 15 points better in Hamtramck than Dearborn lmao",
         ">this survey had biden win catholic voters by 1.\n\nthat's stupid",
         "In my personal experience (as a protestant), the vote is probably somewhat divided. \n\nLots of \"mainline\" churches, such as  the Episcopalian,  Methodists and United churches have pretty progressive theology, supporting gay marriage, trans rights, emphasizing care for the poor, etc. \n\nHowever, the more \"typical\" protestant voter in the states is likely a Baptist, Reformed and Pentecostal, and they tend to have much more conservative theology, and many of them are outright pro-Trump.",
         "The Episcopalian Church is basically all libs now, sadly it's a smaller denomination",
         "You'd have to get more granular, and even then it doesn't work well.\n\nNearly every major protestant tradition is subdivided into evangelical and mainline versions.\n\nSo take Presbyterians for example, the two largest demonimations are\n\n- (~ 1 Million members) PCUSA - Mainline protestant, affirming\n\n- (~400k members) PCA - Conservative, confessional calvinist\n\nMost of these traditional protestant deniminations (eg: Presbyterian, Episcopalian, lutheran, methodism) originate from the more liberal mainline branches, and thus will be more \"left leaning\" just by that existence.\n\nConversely most evangelical churches now a days are just some form of \"non-demonimaonal/congregational\" which more often than not means vaguely baptist and/or charismatic views.",
         "In other words, it probably splits down mainline vs. evangelical denominations."
