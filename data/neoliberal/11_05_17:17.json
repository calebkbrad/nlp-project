Yes, you're right, if there was one unified poll and we used the national popular vote, you wouldn't need to do anything else (though you wouldn't need to do anything else even if it was well outside the margin of error either), but we don't live in that world, and therefore some modicum of rigor is preferable to vibes.",

I have state level pride, but as a liberal living in Boston, I share more in common with a liberal in Providence or New Haven than a MAGA extremist in Springfield, MA. \n\nAnd I\u2019m sure some members of my family in Florida feel like they have more in common with the MAGA voter living an hour north of them in rural Georgia than the progressive college students an hour away in the other direction in-state. \n\nI think by this point, America is united enough that the popular vote would work better for most people. One popular vote across the whole country enables people to have a voice by allying with like-minded people across the country. The \u201cwinner of 50 popular vote contests\u201d strategy where people in smaller states get more votes than people in larger states, works worse for most people.",

Texas is more competitive, but they also haven\u2019t voted for a Democrat since 1976.

The \u201cno social unrest\u201d (#8) key arguably should be turned against Harris too. And the \u201cstrong short-term economy\u201d (#5) key is ambiguous given how Lichtman has applied it in the past: in 1992, he treated it as a subjective decision and counted it against George W.

Of course his result is going to be in line with most polls.  \n\n>but he\u2019s also technically predicting a Harris victory\n\nNot really.  It's inappropriate to interpret 50/50 (or even 55/45) as a firm prediction in either direction, and he would not say that he's predicting a Harris victory.\n\n>which keeps him in line with exit polling data and other data on the ground\n\nWhat exit polls have been released so far?  What \"data on the ground\" are you referring to?  Early voting is not predictive of election results, nor are things like crowd size.  Polls have their problems, but they are the best tool we have for gauging public opinion, and the merit of a model like this is that it is calibrated based on historical polling errors.  \n\nI really don't understand what people want when they make criticisms like this.  Nate Silver uses a transparent methodology that he announced in advance and that he doesn't change based on subjective vibes.  He has not changed anything in the methodology on the basis of late indicators, not is he trying to skew his model one way or the other.  He just added all of the polls that have been released so far and let the internal logic of the model do its thing.  \n\nHe is trying his level best to make a probabilistic forecast on the basis of the available polling data.  The available polling data indicate a true toss-up.  Maybe there are problems with the polls (for one thing, they may be herding towards a false consensus), but it's not the job of a polling aggregator like him to put his thumb on the scale one way or the other.  His model accounts for the magnitude of historical polling errors, but it doesn't assume that the error will go in one direction any more than the other (because historically, the direction of polling error is random).",
         "Yeah",
         "they had a pretty big fight over replacing biden at all, but once that happened there was pretty much immediate unanimity on harris as the replacement, yeah nate's wrong about this one",
         "The riots in 92 were centered mainly in LA. The riots in 2020 were far more widespread and violent. \n\nIt\u2019s extremely hard for the social unrest key to flip. It\u2019s only happened twice",
         ">Key 2: What fight? What primary contest?\n\nThere was a major fight about getting Biden to drop out, and many prominent Democrats wound up with egg on their faces for insisting for so long that concerns about his age were unfounded when they actually weren't.\n\n>Key 8: What social unrest? Where? Who? Why?\n\nThere have been highly publicized and disruptive campus protests about Israel/Palestine.",
         "There was a primary fight around kamala in the form of trying to convince Joe to drop out. Don't you remember the dems in disarray stuff for months? That key is about whether there was conflict around the nominee (which there was), not whether eventually everyone accepted the nominee. 99% of the time, people eventually accept the nominee. By your logic, that would mean the key should never be turned since it's very rare for a party to outright reject the nominee.\n\n\nSocial unrest I'd say has to do with the extreme polarization in the country and the fact that people are definitely gonna riot after the results. Again though, nate says it \"arguably\" should be turned. It's an ambiguous key.\n\n\nI think the third one is pretty self explanatory and hard to argue against. Few people view the economy as good right now, no matter what the stats say",

         "That key is about whether or not there was a fight for the nomination, not whether people eventually accepted the person as a nominee. Majority of the time, the party eventually accepts the nominee. Of course they all accepted kamala, but you're kidding yourself if you think there wasn't a fight for the nomination",
         "You need to actually \\*read the keys\\*! \n\n  \nKey 2 specifically talks about the convention. Key 2 is FALSE if the nominee doesn't get more than 2/3 of the delegates on the first vote. Kamala, as far as I know, cleaned house without anyone putting up a challenge. Contrast this to 2016 where Clinton only got 59% of the delegates on first vote. Key 2 is clearly True for Kamala.",
         "But the important thing about having a primary fight and it being bad for the nominee is you get the people who wanted the challenger to be the nominee and they wind up not supporting the nominee. There just aren't that many Democrats who firmly backed Biden but won't support Harris because Biden was replaced. There are no \"Biden or Bust\" people.",
         "Maybe you and Nate should actually try reading the keys. \n\nKey 2 (no primary contest) is turned true if the incumbent party nominee wins at least two-thirds of the total delegate vote on the first ballot at the nominating convention, with no deep and vocal party divisions.\n\nShe got two thirds of the total delegate vote on the first ballot and there was no deep and vocal party divisions at the convention. This is CLEARLY a true key.",
         "the reason a fight for the nomination is bad is because candidates spend months trash talking and knifing eachother and staking out maximally far left/right positions to appeal to ideological primary voters. who was competing with kamala for the nomination by doing that?",
         "I think the key is about whether the final nominee had to endure months of slap fighting with a challenger. Kamala Harris did not. People speculated on other nominees but ultimately even Tim Walz endured more of a fight the VP nomination than Harris did for her presidential nomination.",
         "Also, this is a key because you get the situation where the diehard supporters of the challenger aren't enthused by the nominee and either don't show up or actually vote against them You know, the \"Bernie or Bust\" type voters. But there aren't a significant number of Democrats who were supporting Biden but are mad that Kamala replaced him and won't show up for her.",
         "Fair enough, but i still think there's something to be said about the situation with biden and all the negative press that created"

From its Wikipedia page:\n\n>Although most New Hampshire polling stations open around sunrise and close in the early evening, Dixville Notch takes advantage of a state law that allows a precinct to close if all registered voters in that precinct have cast ballots. Consequently, all registered voters in Dixville Notch gather and are counted before the balloting takes place.

         "This is not how sampling works, you don't need an appreciable fraction of the total to know with relatively little uncertainty what the total population looks like.\n\nWhen you randomly poll a voter, they're going to (for simplicity's sake), say candidate A or candidate B. Let's call P the fraction of the population that supports A (and 1-P supports B), the chance the random voter says A is then P, etc. If you want to estimate P, you just need to keep randomly finding voters and seeing what they say, the fraction of those randomly sampled voters that say A is your estimate of P.\n\nNow the uncertainty in your estimate doesn't depend on the population size. That might seem counterintuitive, but look at what we're estimating, the probability that someone says one of two things. That is the same problem as asking, say, whether a coin is fair--it's going to be heads or tails and you want to know the chance of each. Now the number of samples (coin flips) you need to certain in that case can't depend on the population, there isn't one, you're not drawing on some repository of flipped coins. You can do some maths and show that for something near 50/50 you need roughly 1,000 samples to estimate the probability of a binary outcome to within +/-3%, 95% of the time.\n\nNow of course what's tricky here is getting a random sample of voters. That's hard, arguably impossible really, so pollsters need to use workarounds like weighting. But notably you can't just solve it with polling more people if your methodology doesn't change--your sample will be just as biased by the underlying non-randomness. Suppose supporters of candidate A are twice as likely to answer the phone as supporters of B--it doesn't matter if you call 1,000 or 10,000 people, you're gonna find way too many people supporting A.",

         "> When Marco Gutierrez, a founder and spokesman for the little-known and sparsely populated advocacy group \u201cLatinos for Trump\u201d recently tried to warn America of the grave dangers of open borders and free migration with the image of \u201ctaco trucks on every corner,\u201d most viewers, Latino and Anglo alike, seem to have experienced a vision of a possible new utopia. The tag immediately trended on Twitter, not in panic but in near-universal celebration of the possibility.\n\n> What people do not know is how hard government has worked for years to prevent this from happening. The War on Street Food has been going on for more than 100 years.\n\n> It\u2019s just the most recent installment in a long, ludicrous history of American government\u2019s mean-spirited and petty war on tamales and tamaleros and Mexican street-food vendors in general.\n\n> > By 1901, more than a hundred tamale wagons roamed Los Angeles, each paying a dollar a month for a city business license. Their popularity spurred others in outlying cities to follow their example. In 1906, Sonoran immigrant Alejandro Morales began selling his wife\u2019s tamales from a wagon he commandeered through Anaheim. Morales, a ditch digger by trade, grew the concept into a restaurant, then a tamale factory, then Alex Foods, a multimillion-dollar empire now known as Don Miguel Mexican Foods. . . . It wasn\u2019t just Latinos who operated tamale wagons \u2014 African Americans, European immigrants and whites also partook in the industry. In 1905, even the YMCA opened a temporary tamale wagon to raise funds so it could send a boy\u2019s track and field team to compete in Portland, Ore.\n\n> But as the popularity of tamale wagons and Mexican street food spread, the established business press and Anglo governments increasingly looked on the vendors with suspicious eyes. In San Antonio, Anglo city fathers began a series of running regulatory battles to stamp out the threat of fresh chili con carne as they passed regulations and closed down public use of plazas to stamp out the entrepreneurial efforts of so-called \u201cchili queens.\u201d Food historian Jeffrey Pilcher notes that cities were remade in the image of nativist and protectionist fears about the disruptive effects of a laissez-faire public market in immigrant food staples.\n\n> The truth is that we could \u2014 and should \u2014 have had taco trucks on every corner, tamale wagons on every major thoroughfare, chili queens ruling every public plaza, decades ago if not for the suspicious gaze of city regulators, the protectionist interests of brick-and-mortar restauranteurs, the itchy hyperregulation of urban improvers, and the cosntant effect of border-control hysteria, nationalist culture policing and anti-immigrant moral panics.

We can simply vote and hope for the best. \n\nIn the mean time. I find solace that Kamala ran a damn near perfect campaign. Trump has the far right (no salvaging that voting bloc). But he did nothing to expand his base and ran one of the worst campaigns I\u2019ve seen in my lifetime. With that, Kamala needed to fit everyone from leftists to center-right moderates under her tent. I think she did a great job at messaging to everyone in those demos *and* staying positive, joyful, and confident. Her VP pick is one of the most likable politicians in the modern era. Her social media game is amazing and I think it shows in youth turnout so far. She did everything right. And she has massive momentum going into Tuesday. \n\nIf Trump still wins, then there was literally nothing any of us could do about it.",

         "I worry about the possibility that Donald Trump will win the 'old fashioned way', but even more that he might win through some bizarre trickery.  In particular, Eli Mystal has unlocked [a new fear](https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/little-secret-trump-johnson-election/) that the Republicans will employ skullduggery and a novel reading of the constitution to win the electoral vote by lowering the number of electors who are actually counted, thus the number needed for a majority.\n\n>...I think the plan is to steal the Electoral College outright by getting states Trump loses to refuse to certify the results of their election. That\u2019s because the 12th Amendment provides that the president is the person who wins the majority of the \u201cwhole number of Electors appointed.\u201d That \u201cwhole number\u201d is supposed to be 538. But one *potential* reading of the amendment is that Trump doesn\u2019t have to win 270 Electoral College votes but just a *majority* of however many electors show up. Trump\u2019s goal, I believe, is to decrease the number of electors appointed until he wins.\n\n>This reading is untested. Nobody has yet tried to win an election with fewer than a majority of the Electoral College votes by decreasing the overall number of electors appointed after the election. But it\u2019s an argument the Trump team could put forward, and it\u2019s an argument Democratic lawyers and experts are preparing for.\n\n>The first step in such a process is to get Republicans in states Trump loses to contest the certification of their own elections. In 2020, Trump and his team illegally tried to get slates of alternate electors submitted in states where Republicans control the state legislatures. They could try that again, but for this scheme to work, they don\u2019t even have to get \u201cfake\u201d electors submitted but just to convince Republican state legislatures or Republican governors not to submit their valid slates of electors before statutorily imposed deadlines. All slates of electors are supposed to be certified by December 11. Those electors are then supposed to vote and submit their results by December 25.\n\n>What this means is that Republicans just have to delay long enough to pass those deadlines. They don\u2019t have to win; they just have to stall.\n\nBefore this, there might well be chaos and violence, although I hope that enough Trump cultists will be too chickenshit to pursue what they profess to crave.  \n\nThere will surely be threats, at least.  In 2020 Donald Trump threatened the family of Al Schmidt, who was then a [City Commissioner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_City_Commissioners)\\* of Philadelphia, precisely because despite being a Republican, he assiduously and faithfully executed his office.  Now his is [Secretary of the Commonwealth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_the_Commonwealth_of_Pennsylvania), which could make him an even greater target for Republican rage.  \n\n\\*Elected officers who are responsible for administering elections in Philadelphia.  There are three and no party is allowed to hold more than two of the seats.  Commissioner Schmidt was the sole Republican in 2020; his prot\u00e9g\u00e9  Seth Bluestein holds that distinction now.",

The arrests were made in the Leipzig area, in Dresden, in the district of Mei\u00dfen and one also in Zgorzelec, Poland. A total of 20 properties were searched. Several local AfD politicians are among the suspects. Shots were fired during one of the arrests.\n>\n>In addition to those arrested, the federal prosecutor's office also has seven other suspects in its sights.

It was led by J\u00f6rg S., who was arrested in Zgorzelec. Four of those arrested - Karl K., J\u00f6rn S., Kevin M. and Norman T. - were still adolescents in the early days. The group is said to have comprised up to 20 people in total.\n>\n>According to the federal prosecutor's office, the group was \u2018militant\u2019 and its ideology was characterised by \u2018racist, anti-Semitic and in some cases apocalyptic ideas\u2019. The group was united by a \u2018deep rejection\u2019 of the basic democratic order in Germany.\n>\n>J\u00f6rg S. is said to have been the ringleader of the group.

Jr., is a convicted right-wing extremist from Austria who was active in the militant neo-Nazi scene there in the 1980s. J\u00f6rg S. is said to have been arrested in Poland. One of his brothers, J\u00f6rn S., is also among those arrested. Searches were carried out on two other brothers, but no arrests were made.\n>\n>According to taz information, the suspects also include local AfD politicians Hans-Georg P., Kevin R. and Kurt H\u00e4ttasch.\n>\n>Hans-Georg P. sat for the AfD on Leipzig's East District Advisory Council until the end of 2022. Kevin R. has been a deputy member of both the social committee and the advisory board for culture, youth and sport in the city of Grimma for the AfD since August 2024. In 2021, R. was the \u2018media representative\u2019 and \u2018JA coordinator\u2019 of the AfD district association in Leipzig.\n>\n>H\u00e4ttasch is currently on the board of the same AfD district association in Leipzig and was elected to the Grimma city council in 2024.

At the gathering, AfD politicians and members of the Junge Alternative met with neo-Nazis, hooligans and nationalists and glorified National Socialism: Hitler Youth songs were sung and an SS standard bearer was honoured.\n>\n>In spring 2022, photos show H\u00e4ttasch in Schnellroda, Saxony-Anhalt, travelling to the so-called \u2018Spring Academy\u2019 at the then \u2018Institute for State Politics\u2019 run by the new right-wing ideologue G\u00f6tz Kubitschek. The institute disbanded in May 2024 to avoid being banned. The events in Schnellroda were used for networking across the far-right scene. Martin Sellner, a leading figure in the Identitarian movement in Austria and Germany, can be seen in other photos from the Spring Academy 2022.\n>\n>Security sources confirmed to taz in the early afternoon that shots were also fired when H\u00e4ttasch was arrested in Grimma. He was injured in the jaw and had to be treated in hospital. H\u00e4ttasch had grabbed a weapon himself. Whether the projectile came from there or from a police weapon is still being clarified. Der [Spiegel](https://www.spiegel.de/panorama/schuesse-bei-festnahme-von-terrorverdaechtigem-afd-politiker-a-b2c0ff1e-934c-43ea-82a4-fb5945a976d1?sara_ref=re-so-app-sh) first reported on the shooting.\n>\n>The press spokesperson of the AfD Saxony, Andreas Harlass, told taz: \u2018We have nothing in common with such a suspected neo-Nazi \u201cseparatist group\u201d, neither in terms of content nor organisation. If the allegations against Mr H\u00e4ttasch are confirmed, he will be expelled from the party immediately.\u2019\n>\n>According to the arrest warrants issued on Tuesday, the right-wing extremists are said to have been convinced that Germany was on the brink of \u2018collapse\u2019. On the corresponding [\u2018Day X\u2019](https://taz.de/Bilanz-zum-Hannibal-Netzwerk/!5977591/), the group is said to have planned to use armed force to conquer areas in Saxony and possibly other eastern German states in order to establish a National Socialist regime there. Unwanted groups of people were to be \u2018removed through ethnic cleansing\u2019.\n>\n>The group is also said to have repeatedly carried out paramilitary training with combat equipment. They practised house-to-house combat, the use of firearms and night and forced marches. The group is also said to have obtained camouflage suits, combat helmets, gas masks and protective waistcoats.\nThe Federal Criminal Police Office, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution and the Saxony State Criminal Police Office were involved in the investigation. More than 450 police officers were deployed during the arrests and searches, including special forces. Austrian and Polish secret services were also involved.\n>\n>Thomas Haldenwang, President of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, explained in response to an enquiry from taz: \u2018Today's executive measures highlight the continuing high threat to Germany's internal security posed by right-wing extremism.\u2019 Some of the group's protagonists are very young right-wing extremists with links to a scene that is particularly active in virtual space. The followers of this so-called \u2018victory scene\u2019 or militant accelerationism glorify the deeds of well-known right-wing terrorists such as Anders Breivik and Brenton Tarrant. They pursue the goal of participating in an expected violent overthrow - Day X - of the political system.\n>\n>\u2018Siege\u2019 was originally a newsletter written by the US right-wing extremist James Mason for the National Socialist Liberation Front in the 1980s, the contents of which were later published in book form. [According to right-wing extremism expert Spencer Sunshine](https://taz.de/Autor-ueber-die-US-Neonazi-Szene/!6033065/), Mason has found his followers on image boards and in telegram groups in recent years - and inspired neo-Nazi networks such as the right-wing terrorist \u2018Atomwaffen Division\u2019.\n>\n>Konstantin von Notz, deputy leader of the Greens' parliamentary group in the Bundestag and chairman of the Parliamentary Control Panel, told the taz newspaper: \u2019Once again, it has become clear that the dangers posed by a steadily growing far-right scene are very real. The scene's high level of organisation is and remains extremely worrying.\u2019 Transnational networking is also progressing and far-reaching financial structures are being established. Links between the \u2018Saxon separatists\u2019 and other countries, not just Poland, must be systematically investigated. \u2018Where extremists network internationally, this must also apply to the security authorities. Together, they must take decisive action against cross-border threats,\u2019 said von Notz.\n>\n>Federal Minister of the Interior Nancy Faeser (SPD) spoke of a \u2018very important investigative success\u2019. The security authorities had \u2018thwarted militant coup plans by right-wing terrorists at an early stage, who were longing for a day X to attack people and our state with armed force\u2019. The fact that the group had trained with weapons and had already procured equipment shows how dangerous they were.\n\nhttps://taz.de/Festnahmen-von-Neonazis-in-Sachsen/!6046702/\n\n*Translated with DeepL.com (free version)*",
