         "From [here](https://www.ft.com/content/e8ac09ea-c300-4249-af7d-109003afb893) - I increasingly buy the idea that the Democrats were facing a really uphill battle this year and there wasn't a whole lot they could have done that would have swung the outcome. Maybe having a candidate not directly tied to the Biden administration would have helped, but I think people would still have treated them as the incumbent party.\n\nI realise that this might be cope.",
         "Everyone wants some grand conspiracy but I think it\u2019s literally just inflation. \n\nJust sucks that it\u2019s under control now and that he can take credit",
         "Before people huff too much copium here: what this means is that the central banks have \"learned\" that crashing an economy is better than permitting any kind of noticeable inflation. You better hope that you're not going to be the one that loses their job next time around thanks to people demonstrating that they're entirely lacking in empathy and would prefer literal \"beggar thy neighbor\" policies to bearing any kind of shared social burden.",
         "I know every man and his dog has an opinion on this election, but I think fundamentally it comes down to two things on the liberal side. First of all, inflation is political poison for incumbents and a loss for the Democrats was probably inevitable; in keeping with trends we have seen all across the democratic world. However, just because this election was decided by inflation does not mean that we are also seeing significant voter dissatisfaction with the Democrat party. The hemorrhaging of votes in deep blue states and urban areas points to Democrat mismanagement in how those areas are run. The gender divide and the particular loss of Latino voters points to a deep cultural disconnect with voters.",
         "There really is a mess going on with liberal democracies, isn't there?\n\nI dearly hope this passes, but... Well, I fear it won't without some sort of catastrophe showing people why being an apathetic cynic who votes against more than for anything is a bad idea.",
         "In some ways this is comforting.  The after-election analyses have theories getting thrown around wildly about how democrats can perform better next cycle.  I've seen a ton of suggestions that we're just in a more conservative period in US politics and democrats should just shift further right to compensate.  I've seen people suggest abandoning gay marriage as a topic. ???  It has 70%+ support, wtf are you talking about??\n\nThis might be wishful thinking, but to me this is just a terrible cycle to be an incumbent party.  Inflation sucks ass and whoever is the sitting party is getting blamed for it.\n\nThere's some self-reflection here that's good, but I really think Conservatives in the US are gonna overplay their hand in the next 2 years and get burned when grocery prices don't magically go back to 2019 levels.  Their policies in general aren't remotely popular, so they're either gonna do nothing and hope they remain popular, or roll out toxic policies in the hopes they can utilize enough propaganda to make them popular.",
         "It has happened in many Developing countries too. India is the biggest example. The ruling party BJP was expected to get 400+ seats but they fell well short of even getting the simple majority of 272 seats.",
         "Add Korea, Canada and Australia after next year.",
         "In the current media environment it seems that being the incumbency candidate/party is a major disadvantage when it once was seen as a plus. Every governing administration has a million eyeballs and 2 millions ears directed at them, and every single mistake, flubbed speech, or piece of bad news is published and spread around the internet immediately. \n\nOne of my other thoughts on this is what it means for longer term initiatives in the future. We all know that one of the genuine benefits of a dictatorship or one-part state is that they don't have to worry about losing an election and can take their time fostering plans that could take a decade to roll out. What will it mean for the effectiveness of governments if it's basically assumed that you will only have one term in office?",
         "It's a little bit sobering to realize that ultimately, a lot of the times the strength of a candidate, the campaign, the ground game, none of that matters if the cosmic dice roll comes up snake eyes. There's a lot less that we can do to influence elections than we think, sometimes it's literally just uncontrollable circumstance.\n\nMakes me a feel a bit apathetic and fatalist tbh. Maybe this is ALWAYS how it was gonna play out.",

         "In hindsight, it would have been better if Trump won in 2020. Dems would have the Senate and blocked anything he put through. He would be an unpopular lame duck and the Dems would have won in a landslide in 2024. Now we have a Republican Senate, House, and Presidency.",
         "I wonder what this graph looks like if you return to the Great Depression. Besides WW2, it's hard to imagine any other event since WW1 that disrupted the social fabric similarly to COVID and, not so coincidentally, was probably the closest we came to electing a genuine authoritarian (in the form of [Foghorn Leghorn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huey_Long)) until now, depending on how you count Nixon.",

         "The economic conditions this year were no where near as bad as 2008. I truly think people have just gotten more fickle and reactionary over this period, driven in part by new media bubbles that thrive on negativity. When so many sources are competing for your attention - negativity is one of the few reliable drivers of clicks and views.",

         "This should be pinned to the top of every op ed for the next six months",
         "This is important context, but I would like to add some caveats. This election is of course the most recent and so has inflation the furthest in the past compared to other elections this year. The US has also done MUCH better economically than all EU economies for example, so I think you'd expect incumbents to do much better here regardless. Also, I don't think Trump is a very good candidate, and he's unique - comparisons to other elections are tricky when other elections don't have Trump in them.  While it is important to keep in mind that incumbents are getting trounced everywhere, I don't think this was a 'no democrat could have won no matter what we did in the past 4 years' kind of election.",
         "global inflation is blamed on the ruling party",
         "I will not deny this was a huge factor, but I hope the democrats don't take this as being the reason they lost, and not change anything in response.  Of all the countries that could've been the exception to the rule, it should've been America seeing as we had one of the most successful post-pandemic economies in the world.  The democrats failed on messaging, our policies like those on abortion, healthcare, lgbt Issues, and hell many of our economic policies are popular, but we did an utterly miserable job at communicating them.",
         "I would like to see a scatterplot with vote share on one axis and that country's aggregated inflation over the last 2 years on the other axis.",
         "Did those countries also chose a convicted man and an insurrectionist against their respective incumbent governments?",
         "Welcome to the consequences of all those world leaders working together to implement the same disastrous COVID policies all around the world.  Inflation was indeed global, caused worldwide by multiple world leaders working together to implement the same inflationary policies in multiple countries.

         "Kamala should have held one of those kangaroo court trials for Biden declaring him guilty of Bidenflation and then executed him on live TV, I feel like that may have barely been enough",
         "It was an uphill battle, sure, but it really seems it was winnable. Democrats won the senate seats in Wisconsin + Michigan. As I write, they are ahead in Nevada + Arizona, and only 0.4% behind in Pennsylvania.\n\nIf you had a presidential candidate outperforming the senate races by 0.4%, Democrats would have won the presidency 287 to 251. And that's not counting Georgia (no high-profile statewide race) and NC (the governor race is an outlier).\n\nInstead, the presidential candidate underperformed those senate races by an average of 2.8 (Nevada 2.9, Arizona 7, Wisconsin 1.8, Michigan 1.8, Pennsylvania 0.6).\n\nHarris was a better candidate than Biden, but I do think she was a worse candidate than almost any senator/governor from a purplish state. (mostly because of her association with an unpopular administration)",
         "Obvious hindsight but it seems like the 2 pre-reqs to win as a dem for the presidency would be to \n\n1. Be completely separate to the Biden admin\n2. Openly trash and get into fights with the admin\n\nKamala is obviously unable to do both and while she ran a good campaign she should\u2019ve not accepted the nomination.",
         ">I increasingly buy the idea that the Democrats were facing a really uphill battle this year and there wasn't a whole lot they could have done that would have swung the outcome\n\nI was saying this, saying that the US is not a special nation, it's just a NORMAL nation\n\nBut this sub responded me with a shower of American exceptionalist rethotic about how America was better than that and Kamala was gonna sweep\n\nApparently, the US is not exceptional and is just as swayed by international tides as any other",
         "Biden threw it as soon as he decided to run for re-election. Historically unpopular president with record inflation and he decided the best thing to do is run a victory lap on the economy. Bidenomics was on every attack ad that wasnt about immigrants/trans people and is still the worst politicing i have seen in my lifetime.\n\nWith how close it was i really think someone from outside his administration could have comfortably swung it. Theres a lot of reckoning that needs to happen in the dem party, but how disconnected leadership is and how they were so in line with biden needs to be a part of it.",
         "Democrats were a balance to republicans, a sort of crappy one, but it was what it was, now they are a balance to a Republican Party that no longer exists. Populism took over the nation, the GOP harnessed it, whereas democrats rejected it outright in 2016. As a result, it looks like neo-reactionism won, not just this election but overall.",
         "It's definitely a factor though in addition to economics (a huge hurdle), the Dems just don't seem to have that big of a bloc anymore.",

         "What countries are in this dataset?",
         "I think Open Primary's need to be treated as sacrosanct. It makes it much easier for people to justify protest voting when they can legitimately whine that their voices weren't heard.\n\nAnd for what it's worth, I don't think Biden did anything legally wrong or inappropriate; However, waiting as long as he did to drop out made it look like he was trying to freeze the race for Kamala Harris. That demoralized many people.",
         "Until his tarrifs and the economic policy ideas make it worse",
         "I dont think it's a conspiracy to add in people's perception of their world is shaped differently now too.  We're seeking out media that tells us things aren't good.  It's not the whole story but it definitely plays a part.\n\nIt played a part in why Trump lost in 2020 too.",
         "Closing down all the widget factories was deeply unpopular. Please do not pay people to stay home. Please. Please do not do that again.",
         "Nah, it's not inflation, consumer sentiment has picked up now that inflation has resided. It's the vibes. Dems have off-putting vibes and Trump is funny and kinda charming.",
         "I think where I am right now is that I both believe we 100% lost this election due to inflation, and also think that we need to do some serious soul searching about what is going on with young men and Latinos (both of which are trends that have been going on for a while, but looked BAD in this election).",
         ">  but I think it\u2019s literally just inflation.\n\nBiden's actions exacerbated inflation in the US though. Unlike most countries in OPs dataset, the US was almost completely shielded from energy inflation. We should've been at like 4-5% inflation which would've calmed down by early 2023 with the interest rate increases. However, Biden's additional stimulus and pro-labor policies forced us into have 9% inflation and have some of the last rate cuts in the developed world.",
         "Yeah it's extremely bad news for macro policy imo and the next recession will probably be brutal as central banks overcompensate for this",
         ">central banks have \"learned\" that crashing an economy is better than permitting any kind of noticeable inflation. \n\nWhy would this be the lesson? It is not the job of the central bank to keep the incumbent political party in power.\n\n\nPersonally, I'm quite happy that this scenario led to the loss of the Conservative party in the 2024 UK general election. America is not the world",
         "I don't think that's true, I think it's that people are actually just too fucking stupid to comprehend the concept of there existing a tradeoff between unemployment and inflation.\n\n\nI bet that had literally nothing been done in terms of fiscal/monetary policy voters would've instead been whining about the record high unemployment numbers (which would be fair) and still voting for opposition parties in droves because everything bad that happens when you're in power is your fault (except for Covid, somehow they can't think back to four years ago)",
         "Do we have to talk about recessions in such apocalyptic terms? In past decades we had recessions every 5-10 years that were not \"crashes.\"",
         ">they're entirely lacking in empathy and would prefer literal \"beggar thy neighbor\" policies to bearing any kind of shared social burden.\n\nA lesson we really should have learn during Covid tbh, where Americans showed by and large that they will kill their neighbor willingly if it means they can move on with their lives uninhibited. Heck, many chose to kill themselves out of sheer disinformation-fueled spite for the collective good.\n\nIt really is every man for himself out here and people want it that way. Maybe it's always been. And I guess sadly I feel it myself after this election. One of the first things I told my wife is \"welp, we tried. Time to look out for ourselves now.\" Like, I'll still vote and such but I'm kinda done with the love thy neighbor. They don't want it. It's fine. We'll all have our own castles with a moat and drawbridge.",
         "Do most countries subscribe to the same model of an independent central bank that the US (currently) does? \n\nIf not, I get the point you\u2019re making.\n\nBut if so, would the banks\u2019 prerogative to responsibly steward the economy (regardless of popular sentiment) override any pressure to placate voters and help out the incumbent? I wouldn\u2019t see how they would learn a lesson from this- the goals were achieved, whether or not the public is capable of understanding them.",
         "Most central banks already have the sole mandate of controlling inflation. The Fed\u2019s dual mandate of also controlling unemployment is unique among central banks.",
         "Ill continue to scream that if life keeps getting worse in saphire blue areas the dems will never recover. Local and state demd have heralded in exploding housing prices while abandoning things like transit and ignoring issues from homelessness because its politcally inconvenient.\n\nIf dems at the federal level dont start screaming at state and local leaders to cut the bullshit the bleeding is only going to get worse. And it should",
         ">First of all, inflation is political poison for incumbents and a loss for the Democrats was probably inevitable\n\nI'm really trying to wrack my brain around how the Democrats did so much better than expected in 2022, even after inflation had been raging for a year at that point. Was the fresh sting from the Dobbs decision a motivating factor for so many people? Were people much more disenchanted by inflation by 2024 because it had become more entrenched by that point? It's going to be an interest next few months as these analyses unfold.",
         "I really think it just comes down to three things:\n\n- Inflation\n- Building more housing\n- Woke-scolding\n\nInflation was baked in and was handled better in the US as anywhere else, so there's not much that could have been done better. But the messaging was bad, i.e. instead of tauting massive investments they should have started by going all in on messaging that they were focused on driving inflation down and only when it was truly coming down hyped up any spending measures such as the IRA and Chips act. As it was the Republicans were able to characterize them as big spenders who made inflation worse, which isn't supported by the data but lost them the messaging battle.\n\nDemocrats needed to go hard-core YIMBY and crush all local opposition towards zoning  reform, if they'd done that in 2020 maybe we'd have had some actual success stories in Blue states by the time election came around.\n\nI honestly don't give a shit about the woke stuff, it just doesn't have any meaningful impact on my life but post-2020 it was pretty clear that Democrats should have distanced themselves and just taken the pragmatic position of \"we support whatever lifestyle you have but policing language is silly\" and we're the common sense live and let live party.",
         "Honestly, I think those two things are deeply related.\n\nPeople are upset about inflation. Democrats message on inflation has not been \"we'll fix it\", but \"inflation is fine, actually\". \n\nThe Democratic party appeals to more educated voters, and they know it. And because they know it, they have a tendency to view themselves as the more intelligent party. Republicans are stupid. Saying they'll fix inflation is factually incorrect. etc. There's an \"I know better than you\" kind of attitude that's, frankly, grating. Maybe being the smartest people in the room works in a meritocracy, but not in a democracy.\n\nThe average person doesn't care that inflation is actually going down. They're not using it as a technical term. They care that prices are high, they want prices to be low. Telling people that they're wrong about feeling that way isn't smart, it's just unempathetic. Rather than using that education to figure out a way to creatively meet voter's felt needs without compromising actual needs, the party has opted to just dismiss that view as stupid and ignore it.",
         "IMO conflating Trump appeal to \"dissatisfaction with the democratic party\" is not the right take, those are fundamentally different concepts.",
         "We are human. We must always learn the hard way.",
         "It's really not good, maybe the worst possible result.  It just shows that nothing really matters. There was no messaging or policy or anything that liberal parties could have done. The only thing would have been to lose the previous election.",
         "It all comes back to the way countries all around the world handled covid.  They all pushed the exact same damaging and inflationary policies - hence the whole \"inflation is global\" thing.  Well their constituents, regardless of country, are mad about that.  And so we see what this post is about.",
         "My real problem with Trump's agenda for the next few years is that I have no idea how to calibrate my expectations. Best thing for them politically would be to deport a few people, introduce some finely calibrated tariffs, and change absolutely nothing about Biden's industrial policy. The economy would keep humming along and he could go into the mid-terms with a huge successful message without ever doing very much. But the people around him now are true believers and may actually go down the mass deportation and blanket tariff route, which would be economically and politically disastrous. If he goes down that route, are they nimble enough to walk it back before the impact damages their political future?",
         "I think it basically comes down to how much Republicans fuck up a free lunch. If they just leave things alone they'll ride a red-hot economy to Reagan levels of support. Alternatively they fuck things up with tariffs and their usual nonsense and we continue with the cycle of Republicans blowing up the economy and Democrats fixing it.",

         "Agree.  I have to sigh a little when I hear the term \"incumbent advantage.\"  It's not anymore.  The only advantage I can think of is the bully pulpit.\n\nI wonder if this stems from instant gratification people have gotten use to.  I can see it having a drag on long term investing or projects that will take time to show benefits.  If you can't show voters benefits inside of two to four years, why bother planing longer than that?",
         "It\u2019s only uncontrollable at the last minute, in the long run, this is by design. The republicans have been dismantling public education to keep the population more vulnerable to this for decades. It\u2019s an investment that will pay them dividends for years to come. Some of this kind of backlash is uncontrollable, but a meaningful amount can be controlled and the republicans have proven it time and time again. It\u2019s certainly asymmetrical and easier to keep people misinformed than educated, but education is certainly an effective antidote to this poison.",

Our messaging where we defend California sounds almost exactly like how we campaigned on the US economy: \"You say California is unlivable, but look at the GDP!\" If people can't afford rent, GDP going up is irrelevant to them and we absolutely cannot campaign on how good the economy is.

First of all, regardless if inflation is at historic lows this YEAR---voters are looking at the totality of the past 4 years. I know it's not biden's \"FAULT\" but the point is---inflation since 2020 is the highest over a 4 year span in decades.  This is real.  \n\nThe violent crime rates one is also a bit silly.  It isn't necessarily highly violent crime that makes people feel unsafe.  A lot of crime in CA for example is just smash and grabs/shoplifting (+ homeless folks doing drugs on the street), but it does make pro-social people feel like \"why is antisocial behavior being normalized).  This is why Gascon got trounced in LA.",

That's what people care about.\n\n* The current snapshot inflation rate is almost back to the 2% target, yes.  That's 100% irrelevant because prices are still inflated because they always ratchet up.\n\n* Fewer and fewer people care about the stock market.  The public has realized that the Dow has nothing to do with their actual personal economies.\n\n* The issue with the border question is that it was accomplished by ... adopting the policies of the opposition.  There's no way to spin this as positive for the Democrats.\n\nSo really this highlights exactly why the liberal technocrats keep failing.

But that\u2019s not the case anymore. Facts matter not at all. Perception is everything. It\u2019s certainty. People love the President [George W. Bush] because he\u2019s certain of his choices as a leader, even if the facts that back him up don\u2019t seem to exist. It\u2019s the fact that he\u2019s certain that is very appealing to a certain section of the country. I really feel a dichotomy in the American populace. What is important?

There\u2019s not only an emotional quality, but there\u2019s a selfish quality.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time we encountered this phenomenon, there are lot of ways this election parallels Bush\u2019s victory in 2004.

Hundreds of thousands of people showed up and voted only for president, and they broke heavily for Trump. How many of them got all or most of their information on the candidates from some combination of Twitter, Joe Rogan and other podcasts, or Sinclair broadcasting owned media?\n\nEven among the \"liberal\" media I know that NYT, WaPo, and LA Times have some fantastic journalists, but they aren't the people who write the headlines, send out push alerts, or manage those outlets' social media. The management and owners who influence those decisions are all decidedly right leaning, or at a minimum open to currying favor with Trump by putting their thumb on the scale.\n\nHarris' campaign was almost by-the-book perfect and beat Trump's in almost every metric and it didn't matter at all. Campaigns do not matter when far right wingers and their sympathizers can exert vast amounts of influence over the channels we use to disseminate information and establish consensus about reality.

         "The answer is to get in their sphere and understand what they're actually saying and why they're saying it. You can stand outside the sphere and go \"actually, crime is statistically lower\" and be technically correct, but that's so dismissive to someone who feels like crime is a problem.\n\nFor example: A lot of people in right-wing spheres are upset about smash-and-grab retail theft. [Statistically, that crime is not increasing (though media coverage is) and arresting perpetrators of retail theft doesn't actually reduce property crime.](https://justjournalism.org/page/retail-theft)\n\nSo what's the solution? Do we just tell people they're wrong, it's not actually a problem? No. Even if it's a fringe issue, it's a fringe issue a lot of people care about and it does affect real people. People on the right care about small business owners. We should voice how we're going address retail theft, even if retail theft isn't marginally worse than it was in years past.\n\nTo flip this around. Trans rights is something this sub is passionate about. Someone outside of our sphere could tell us \"Actually, trans rights have improved over the past years and they make up a very small percentage of the population.\" Would we accept that as good enough either? No. Because it's an issue and a people group we care about.\n\nInflation is an even easier example. When people are upset about inflation, they're not upset about the actual rate of inflation. They aren't using it as a technical term. They're upset that gas costs more money. Rather than arguing about the definition, address the concern. How can we make gas more affordable?\n\nWe have to push past \"technically accurate\" and stop dismissing people just because they're wrong. We have to understand what they mean and see how we can address that.",

         "I agree with this article wholeheartedly. I think there were ways Kamala and particularly Biden could have improved our margins (particularly with immigration). But at the end of the day whether you\u2019re a left leaning party, right leaning party or centrist, if you\u2019ve been the incumbent the last few years you\u2019ve been fucked.\n\nI think that Kamala did the best she could and this ironically shows in the results where despite the strong headwinds the GOP didn\u2019t flip any states beyond the big seven (and in hindsight a stronger candidate could very well have flipped bastions like Virginia and Minnesota), the House margins will be single digits and the GOP Senate margin is looking to be 53-54. Still bad don\u2019t get me wrong, but imagine how bad it would have been if Biden stayed in or a more moderate GOP member was the nominee",
         "If only this applied to Russia and China as well. I know it would never happened, but I\u2019d love to see the populace start to turn on the administrations in the same way most democracies seem to be.",
         "Article:\n\n\nAt the time of writing, vice-president Kamala Harris has won almost four percentage points less of the popular vote than President Joe Biden did in 2020, the steepest drop in Democratic support since 1980. What\u2019s more, not only did Donald Trump retake the White House, the Republicans won a majority in the Senate and are likely to retain control of the House of Representatives.\n\n\nSuch a crushing defeat in this week\u2019s US election is bound to elicit months if not years of soul-searching from Democrats. Did Biden hold on for too long? Should party officials have opted for a contested convention instead of parachuting Harris into the race? Has the party\u2019s socially progressive turn alienated some Hispanic and Black men?\n\n\nThe problem is, it\u2019s entirely possible both that the answer to all three of those questions is \u201cyes\u201d, and that taking action to address them would not have produced a fundamentally different outcome. Just as the answer to \u201cwould Britain\u2019s Conservatives have fared better in an autumn election in a lower inflation environment?\u201d is \u201cmaybe\u201d, but the response to \u201cwould it have resulted in a materially different outcome?\u201d is \u201cno\u201d.\n\n\nThe reason I make these assertions is that the economic and geopolitical conditions of the past year or two have created arguably the most hostile environment in history for incumbent parties and politicians across the developed world.\n\n\nFrom America\u2019s Democrats to Britain\u2019s Tories, Emmanuel\u2019s Macron\u2019s Ensemble coalition to Japan\u2019s Liberal Democrats, even to Narendra Modi\u2019s erstwhile dominant BJP, governing parties and leaders have undergone an unprecedented series of reversals this year.\n\n\nThe incumbents in every single one of the 10 major countries that have been tracked by the ParlGov global research project and held national elections in 2024 were given a kicking by voters. This is the first time this has ever happened in almost 120 years of records.\n\n\nUltimately voters don\u2019t distinguish between unpleasant things that their leaders and governments have direct control over, and those that are international phenomena resulting from supply-side disruptions caused by a global pandemic or the warmongering of an ageing autocrat halfway across the world.\n\n\nVoters don\u2019t like high prices, so they punished the Democrats for being in charge when inflation hit. The cost of living was also the top issue in Britain\u2019s July general election and has been front of mind in dozens of other countries for most of the last two years.\n\n\nThat different politicians, different parties, different policies and different rhetoric deployed in different countries have all met similar fortunes suggests that a large part of Tuesday\u2019s American result was locked in regardless of the messenger or the message. The wide variety of places and people who swung towards Trump also suggests an outcome that was more inevitable than contingent.\n\n\nBut it\u2019s not just about inflation. An update of economist Arthur Okun\u2019s \u2018misery index\u2019 \u2014 the sum of the inflation and unemployment rates \u2014 for this era might swap out joblessness and replace it with immigration. On this basis, the past couple of years in the US, UK and dozens of other countries have been characterised by more economic and societal upheaval than they have seen in generations.\n\n\nOf course, in the case of immigration, the distinction between unstoppable global forces and issues amenable to policy is a little fuzzier than with inflation. The rise of immigration around the world, both in numbers and salience, hints at a common global element, but clearly governments are not powerless here.\n\n\nBiden, Harris and the Democrats are not blameless for Tuesday\u2019s decisive defeat. Clearly there are lessons to be learnt. But it\u2019s possible there is just no set of policies or personas that can overcome the current global anti-incumbent wave.",
         "Yeah, very few parties with liberal election processes will survive this wave.\n\nMORENA in Mexico got another six year term with Sheinbaum at the helm. Apparently, AMLO's plan of being essentially Huey Long in Mexico worked to keep MORENA in power, or so I understand",

         "Americans are often terrible at internalizing that there are other countries in the world and Democrats need to remember that now. They don\u2019t need to burn everything down.

         "Realistically even a lot of the other concerns like immigration is just a scapegoat for the inflation and economic vibes. For how long has \"They're stealing our jobs\" been a dominant narrative about migrants? \n\nRacism is an explainer for *why* they become the scapegoat the same way it's an explainer why Jews were the scapegoat in the 30s, but still inevitably it's always going to be easier to maintain the hate when you have a perceived grievance that needs someone to blame it on.

         "Agree on all this. I was very surprised to see just how +R the environment is right now, and the scale of the shifts across the electorate is significant. Seeing the results there was clearly no way for Kamala to win this, and Biden would likely have fared even worse. \n\nPart of this is structural, part is down to Trump\u2019s magic electoral effect and nostalgia for his economy, and part is that the electorate feels disillusioned with the Democratic Party and dislike its rhetoric and governance. Voters may generally agree with key parts of the Democratic platform, but they have little confidence in them to implement and execute it. \n\nAs long as the Democrats fail to reorient their messaging to voters that are slipping away and establish a presence on new media channels to reach voters that have turned their back on the party they will struggle in this new political paradigm.",
         "A lot of people are blaming the Democrats for Trump but the Democratic platform is mostly based around maintaining the status quo and proposing policies that are widely popular even in red states. I'm not sure what they could possibly do to broaden the appeal on a policy level.\n\nThe reality is that people vote based on how their life is going and the incumbent party and the establishment in general is always going to get blamed for bad times. It's not realistic to expect one party to dominate at the national level to the extent that power wouldn't swap to the other side during something like COVID and the aftermath. The reason why someone as extreme as Trump got elected again has much less to do with anything the Democrats have done and much more to do with how unpopular the Republican establishment and traditional Republican platform is within their own party.",
         "If a more moderate Republican was the nominee, we wouldn\u2019t really be worried about the future and our democracy. But there aren\u2019t any left, Trump has molded that whole party to his image.  Even so called moderates like Haley, bend the knee.",
         "I unironically agree with the statement that Harris did the best that she could with the time and resources that she had. \n\nToo many people are engaging in hypotheticals about a late July 2024 Dem primary after Biden dropped out. Logistically, it would be impossible given the short time before the election. I was an ardent Biden supporter on principle of political stability, and I accepted Harris because I literally knew no one else who could and wanted to step up to the plate. \n\nDems panicked, grabbed the first person they thought who could preserve their voting coalition, and shoved them out the front door and onto the stage. There's a real lack of Democratic leaders in the pool right now, and the timing of the Biden drop out made that painfully clear.",
         "Immigration had nothing to do with this election.  Stemming immigration would have made inflation worse, and immigration continues to be something that people care a lot about without actually seeing any negative impact from.  The Dems should have just gone all in on pointing this out, increased immigration, removed tarrifs, and do everything we could get supply chains back up and running, and there is a good chance even then we still would have lost, because a global pandemic kinda fucks us regardless.",

         "What if we promise to forgive even more student loans? Like a rebate? If you borrowed $40K, we'll forgive it all, and give you a check for $40K\n\nThen we'll raise tariffs on, uh, many things from other countries, but this is totally not Trump's tariffs, these are big D Democrat tariffs, which are good for you.\n\nAnd none of this will raise the deficit, because we'll implement a wealth tax but also lock the borders so the billionaires and their money can't escape.",
         "Haley would have the image of a moderate and that alone would\u2019ve been enough to get her a real blowout",

         "Illegal immigration hurt on the election. Especially when Abbot started bussing illegals over to other states and made it their problem. It really shifted opinion towards cracking down on it.",
         "I think the concerns about immigration are largely just economic angst in different clothing.\n\nWhen people feel financially insecure, they don't feel like there's room to share prosperity with other people, and people who are nervous tend to be risk-adverse. Why risk bringing in immigrants who might take your job or put downward pressure on wages?\n\nYes, there is an element of racism and xenophobia, but that's always been there and doesn't explain the shift since 2020. When times are lean, people prioritize \"us\" over \"them\".\n\nWe saw that with social issues, too. Sticking your neck out to protect women and minorities is a luxury for good times, but during lean times you gotta protect yourself first. \n\nRight-leaning media has been stoking fears for that a big economic downturn was on the horizon, so even if you are doing okay right now, you won't have the leeway when the big recession inevitably hits.",
         "It was huge.  There is a correlation between presidential approval rating, and election chances.  Biden\u2019s 40% approval rating was correlated with 48% of vote which is about what Kamala will get.\n\nI strongly believe that dealing with the border earlier and more forcefully would\u2019ve given Biden at least two or three points more approval rating and maybe helped us win the election.\n\nAnd undocumented immigration effects on inflation is negligible since we already have legal immigration for economic purposes already.  However, the effect in terms of perceived unfairness by the electorate was huge.",

         "Immigration likely lowered inflation on the margins, and could have lowered it even more if we embraced it without Americans even recognizing that we're increasing it.  Biden did a lot to stem immigration, with Title 42 expulsions, and keeping immigration caps low.  This didn't stop people from thinking it was a problem.",
         "Did it?  Because Biden massively cut down on immigration vs Obama, and used Title 42 explusions very liberally past Covid.  Biden was in no way pro-immigration, and wanted to pass the Bipartisian border bill that was only shut down by Trump, and yet Biden gets literally no credit for any of it.

         ">  People see illegal immigrants being housed for free \n\nThose people are legal immigrants.  Asylum seekers are here legally.  And Aslyum seekers generally find work fairly quickly, and pay more into taxes than they take out, just like every other immigrant.",

         "People have absolutely no clue how much immigration is normal.  People have no idea what \"gaming the system\" means until Republicans made it a vital part of their narrative.  This is a law thats been in place since the 80s, and there is literally no evidence that Aslyum seekers are gaming the system beyond the fact that people are repeatedly claiming they are.\n\nAnd one other thing to mention, Trump killed the bipartisan immigration bill that would have made this sort of asylum seeking impossible.  Not Dems, not Biden, Trump did, something Lindsay Graham, and Mitch McConnell admit.",

Early on Wednesday morning, just hours after the presidential election was called for Donald Trump, the Cuban national was outside of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2019s Atlanta headquarters, where migrants who entered the country without authorization line up every morning to check in with authorities.\n\nVarela cannot vote in the United States. And if some of Trump\u2019s policies take effect, he could be deported. Still, he believes \u201cthe Americans made the right decision.\u201d\n\nIn his view, Trump was the better option for the U.S. economy. He also associated his opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, with a far-left \u201cCommunist\u201d ideology.\n\nTrump\u2019s hard-line stances on immigration, including a campaign pledge to enact mass deportations, weren\u2019t off-putting. Rather, they were a draw.\n\n\u201cRight now, people are coming in who were bad in our countries, and they\u2019ll be bad here,\u201d Varela said, noting that migrants who are in the country working and not committing crimes should have nothing to fear. \u201cTrump doesn\u2019t want to stop immigration; he wants for it to be controlled, and to block criminals from coming in and destroying the country. It\u2019s a mess.\u201d\n\nWhile Latinos have long been reliable Democrats, in recent years that has changed. Early exit polls \u2014 albeit not a foolproof scan of electoral results \u2014 found that in Georgia, Trump appears to have won 42% of the Latino vote, up 1% from 2020. Nationwide, Trump seems to have improved his performance among Latinos by a double-digit margin, from 32% in 2020 to 45% this year.\n\nThe movement appears to be particularly pronounced among Latino men, various polls show.\n\nOne of them is Zeucis Martinez, an immigrant from Venezuela, Martinez has spent roughly 40 years in Dalton, a majority-Hispanic town inside U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene\u2019s northwest Georgia district. Martinez has helped the local Whitfield County Republican Party launch efforts to court Latino voters in the area, including by manning a booth during Dalton\u2019s annual Mexican Independence Day parade.\n\nIn the past, Martinez said he mostly kept quiet about his politics to avoid ruffling feathers inside Dalton\u2019s Latino community. Now, he says he is vocal about his views and finding positive feedback.\n\n\u201cPeople are agreeing with me,\u201d he said. \u201cThey say, \u2018Yes, we have to go with Trump.\u2019 They think he\u2019s the only man capable of taking this country forward.

She said her entire family voted for Trump because they trust him more on the economy.\n\n\u201cWe like that he is a business owner,\u201d she said. \u201cThese last four years, prices have gone up too much.\u201d\n\nShe also backs Trump\u2019s immigration agenda.\n\n\u201cThe law is the law,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to control the border before it gets completely overrun.\u201d\n\nDespite Republicans\u2019 growing appeal among Latinos, there are still moments of tension for conservatives in heavily Latino communities such as Martinez in Dalton.\n\nAmid the celebrations of Wednesday morning, Martinez also fielded comments online accusing him of having voted against his own people.",

      "text": "We unfortunately have races to win in just 5 months. We may even have a race to win to win next month. Louisiana\u2019s redrawn, VRA, Biden +20 6th congressional district may go to a runoff if Cleo Fields somehow falls below 50%. While we probably won\u2019t win the house, at least this one district could make the math in 2026 easier. Plus the optics of what everyone said was a sure fire pickup instead being a Republican hold of a Black majority district would be a disaster.\n\nBut possibly even more important is Aprils Wisconsin elections. With Liberals getting a majority on the state Supreme Court just 2 years prior, a liberal justices seat is up. The incumbent justice is retiring and in order to protect the progress in overturning gerrymanders, protecting abortion and undoing the damage done by the 2010\u2019s GOP, this is simply a must win seat. Also in Wisconsin, the incumbent Democratic Superintendent of Public Instruction is up for reelection. We also have a Pennsylvania Supreme Court to defend, with three of the 5 Democratic seats up, on a 5-2 court. In two states where divided government will continue, we must take advantage of every opportunity available. \n\nWe also have two statewide elections to win. Both New Jersey and Virginia have their gubernatorial and state legislative races next year, as well as some special elections in both for members moving up to Congress. Gaining a trifecta in Virginia and keeping the trifecta in New Jersey would be massive for morale considering the disastrous performance in both states on Tuesday. I know we may not like the political machines of New Jersey, but after Tuesday, they\u2019ll hopefully die out (please) considering they did nothing for us this year.\n\nWe will also have special elections in other states, both at the legislative level and the congressional level, considering people resigning, taking new jobs or moving into the Trump administration. We cannot just give up, we must defend what we need to defend, and make gains where it\u2019s possible.\n\nAnd maybe most importantly, we have local races to not only flip, but also vote succs and leftists out of. LA and the Bay Area already started this work on Tuesday, and we must win these races to get our key policy goals on bureaucratic and permitting reform, transit, housing, and much more, to help show the people what liberalism can accomplish and achieve.\n\nFolks, it\u2019s time to pull ourselves up by our bootstraps and do what we need to do in order to achieve our goals of taco trucks on every corner, having walkable neighborhoods and cities, and that bureaucratic hell is destroyed.\n\n",

Given that Dems is now the party of midterm elections and most of Trump base doesn't give two shits about anyone but him, we can take back the House in two years. Trump is immune to everything, but the Republican incumbents will pay for his policies.",
         "Call me optimistic, but I think we will see some Dem gains in the next few years culminating in gains in the midterms. Trumps victory was secured by apolitical independents that just wanted lower inflation and cheaper prices.

If he were a single gay man or maybe one with a partner who has a low profile, then yeah I think Americans could be ready for that. But he's got two small kids and Chasten, who's way more engaged on social media than any cabinet member's spouse should ever be. Obviously his prerogative now and no problem, but if he were the spouse of a presidential candidate, it'd cause problems. Gives me huge Teresa Kerry flashbacks. She did her husband no favors in a race he just about won.\n\nAnd for reference, I am a man married to another man with two kids. So I'm speaking from experience here.

         "Article:\n\n\nAs Kamala Harris campaigned through the battleground states in the final days of the presidential race, she closed each stump speech with a question for the crowd: \u201cAre you ready to make your voices heard?\u201d\n\n\nThe US electorate spoke resoundingly on Tuesday night \u2014 and the majority rejected what Harris was pitching.\n\n\nIn a historic win, Donald Trump not only clinched the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the White House but is on course to become the first Republican in 20 years to win the nationwide popular vote. His party also took back control of the US Senate and appeared on course to hold on to the House of Representatives.\n\n\nTrump\u2019s emphatic victory marked a repudiation of not just Harris but also her party\u2019s progressive agenda and its failure to understand the concerns of the majority of US voters.\n\n\n\u201cIf you were hard-eyed and realistic about this, you would say this was the worst outcome at the presidential level for Democrats in this century,\u201d said Bob Shrum, a Democratic campaign veteran who worked on Al Gore and John Kerry\u2019s bids for the White House. \u201cThe Democratic party is going to have to get its act together and move forward.\u201d\n\n\nHarris, a former prosecutor who first ran for president in the 2020 Democratic primaries as a progressive, tacked to the centre when she became her party\u2019s candidate after Joe Biden stepped down following a disastrous debate against Trump in July. She vowed to be a president for \u201call Americans\u201d and put \u201ccountry over party\u201d.\n\n\nBut the pitch fell flat, and Trump was able to rack up big wins across the country, even running up his numbers in traditionally \u201cblue\u201d Democrat-controlled states such as New York and California.\n\n\n\u201cThe Democratic brand is pretty bad,\u201d said Matt Bennett, co-founder of Third Way, a centrist Democratic think-tank. \u201cThe country has shifted pretty far to the right, and we were not aware of how deep the problem ran. The voters that we lost . . . looked at Democrats and said: \u2018They don\u2019t understand my life. I don\u2019t want them representing me.\u2019\u201d\n\n\nAs they reeled from the election result on Wednesday, many in the party asked whether the Harris campaign had allowed Trump and the Republicans to paint them as too far left, or \u201cwoke\u201d, on social issues.\n\n\nThe Trump campaign spent millions of dollars on political ads focusing on transgender issues in the final stretch of the race. \u201cKamala is for they/them,\u201d one said. \u201cTrump is for you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThe ads on the transgender stuff were really unsettling to people\u201d, said Deb Dassow, chair of the Democratic party in Wisconsin\u2019s Ozaukee County, a Republican stronghold in the Milwaukee suburbs that broke for Trump.\n\n\nBut others in the party said the Harris campaign simply failed to address the key concerns of voters on inflation and the cost of living.\n\n\n\u201cIt was the economy first, second and third,\u201d said leading Democratic pollster Jefrey Pollock. \u201cHow do you win when so many voters think that the country is on the wrong track? And when the voters say wrong track, they are really complaining about the economy.\u201d\n\n\nMany in the party believe that a shift to the middle is inevitable if it is to come back in the next presidential election.\n\n\n\u201cThe only way to defeat rightwing populism is through the centre,\u201d said Bennett. Shrum agreed that having \u201ca moderately liberal, centre-left Democratic party is the only way forward if progressives actually want to win\u201d.\n\n\nBut in a sign of disagreements on the horizon, Bernie Sanders, the 83-year-old progressive senator from Vermont who caucuses with Democrats, accused the party\u2019s leaders of defending the \u201cstatus quo\u201d and said they should advocate for universal healthcare and ending US aid to Israel, among other leftwing policy changes.\n\n\n\u201cWill the big money interests and well-paid consultants who control the democratic party learn any real lessons from this disastrous campaign?\u201d said Sanders. \u201cProbably not.\u201d\n\n\nWith the possibility of internecine party warfare on the horizon, several top Democrats cautioned against getting bogged down in ideological battles.\n\n\n\u201cIt is a false choice,\u201d said Pollock. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be having an ideological debate. What we must do is connect with these voters who are clearly not responding to what we have been telling them.\u201d\n\n\nOthers urged the party to look beyond the nation\u2019s capital \u2014 and the existing leadership in the White House \u2014 for a path forward. The Democratic party still has several popular state governors, including in states that Trump won on Tuesday night. They include Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Andy Beshear of Kentucky.\n\n\n\u201cHow do we have an agenda that addresses what people want? How do we talk to them in a way that shows that we understand them and their values?\u201d said Ken Baer, a Democratic strategist and adviser in Barack Obama\u2019s White House. \u201cThat comes from outside of Washington.\n\n\n\u201cWe need a generational change,\u201d Baer added. \u201cWe have had a gerontocracy of 80-year-olds running the Democratic party since Obama left. We need new blood and new leaders.\u201d",

It came only after Biden basically immediately got rid of a lot of Trump border policies, leading to a substantial rise in immigration that was clearly (as shown by the immigration busing) unable to work, while Biden kept with those unpopular new moves for *years* despite consistently having very low approval on immigration, before reversing course in a clearly politically motivated move relatively shortly before the election. And that all came after the 2020 primaries where Biden stood out in the liberal-sphere as \"conservative\" simply because he didn't literally support open borders (by decriminalizing illegal border crossings like most other nominees supported) and because he didn't support abolishing ICE\n\nThe Dems clearly are ridiculously out of touch with the general public on immigration and don't actually want to substantially decrease immigration (like the public wants) as opposed to just supporting a moderate bill to somewhat control the border temporarily as political expedience\n\nIn 2026 and 2028 when Dems can probably get some boost simply from anti incumbency advantage, you likely won't see Dems campaigning on any sort of immigration crackdowns, which will further show how out of touch Dems are on this stuff",

On the flipside, his decline wouldn't impact the others like Biden's decline during the election was poised to negatively impact down ballet Democrats. This is why there's neither calls for his resignation due to age nor really much talk of it at all. Discussion wouldn't achieve anything. Now if he was going to try and run for a third time for President? Yeah, I'd expect some concerns voiced.\n\nYou also kind of touched on another point, his importance as a figurehead. It's not that the Squad has failed (like two weak candidates got primaried), as AOC, Ohan, and Tlaib are still standing, it's more what he stands for. He's the oldest, most experienced Socialist voice in American politics.

I don\u2019t think the desire nor frankly political capital exists to ban contraception. Things don\u2019t need to exist as a fundamental right to not be banned.

The idea of them being more impacted by immigration than literally all the 60 years prior of 2010 is laughable. Nor are most of these immigrants - who as far as I can tell are still largely from Mexico - unable to integrate from the culture. (Most of the immigrants from other South American countries I've met more of further North than these counties, weirdly.)\n\nFor whatever explains the shift, I can tell you that it's sure as hell due to some fundamental change in border dynamics. The lived experiences and data contradict the timing.\n\nI can go on about all the problems these border counties DO face. If it's an anti-incumbency election, most of these counties have an entire laundry list of reasons to be upset at their governing parties.

Maybe the public opposes gender-affirming care for adults in general (though I doubt it) but they for sure opposes spending taxpayer money on expensive surgeries for prison inmates.

Harris understood this, but it seems like the rest of us didn't quite get the message.

I've gotta be real, it doesn't feel good to watch people blame me for all this when I've done everything I can to keep this fascist out of power. I get that being white and being a man is a massive leg up in today's society, but I'm not indestructible, and I know I'm not alone in feeling that way.\n\nThis is why the anti-woke stuff has been so successful for so long. Sure, sexism and racism play a major part in that, but there are a lot of dudes and white people who feel like they have to either be Republican, or hate themselves. The Democratic party is a big tent, but we need to make sure there's room for *everyone* in it. Even if you think it's just privileged people being too sensitive, you have to recognize the practical implications of alienating the two most powerful demographics in this country.\n\nWe've definitely come a long way since 2016, for the record.

It just makes you sound out of touch and elitist.\n\nSo, the obvious answer is you poll for what people are concerned about and you speak to that.  For instance, housing?  All you have to do is say \"There's not enough housing.  There's too much red tape.  But we're gonna cut through that.  We are going to MAKE THEM BUILD!\"\n\nI guarantee you shit like that will get 70% approval rating.  Don't do means-tested, technocratic, wonkish, tax credit mealy-mouthed policy.

Is immigration good or bad? Was it good under Biden but it's bad now? It's just confusing and non committal.\n\nAnd you have to be a special kind of dumbass to not see that Democrats are moving right on immigration as a way to placate voters.

How does one even address a \"vibe-cession?\"  America has all time highs on stock indices and the best economy amongst G7 and it doesn't even matter because it is not what the (swing state) electorate wants. The only logical conclusion I can come to is that American politics is about style over substance (insert always has been meme) and that makes me extremely sad and disappointed. The general electorate is too lazy/lacks critical thinking/can't be bothered to grapple with policy.

         "Here's my take: Democrats basically conceded several policy areas that are important to voters to Republicans, being ashamed of talking about them or knowingly repeating unpopular policy. Instead, they could have attempted to reframe the debate and come up with more serious solutions than Republicans. However, the Democrats being the diverse big tent party they are, are too afraid of enacting bold policies, which gives the much more monolithic Republicans a big advantage. There are 3 main areas where Democrats lacked vision.\n\n1. Economy and inflation: Dems allowed the vibes economy to proliferate. Inflation has been going down for a while, real wages never went down, and many economic indicators are improving. However most people still seem to have the impression that the economy is continuing to fail. Not only were the successes not talked about,  there was no plan for the next 4 years. People feel the need to make big changes. Dems could have instead taken the line that while the economy wasn't doing badly, it's important to decrease the cost of living, and that while Trump plans to make it worse tarrifs, Dems can make it better with free trade, anti-trust action, more progressive taxes that alleviate the burden on the middle class, a higher federal minimum wage, etc.\n2. Crime: Ever since BLM Dems have been stuck between upsetting the activist class by being tough on crime or upsetting the median voters. Harsher sentencing has been tried again and again and it doesn't work, but reducing sentences doesn't reduce crime either. It's time to break out of this dichotomy. Strenghen law enforcement, truly reform the police, and make sure criminal actually get arrested, not just that they get stuck in jail for years on the offchance they do.\n3. Immigration: Again, time to break outside of the dichotomy here. Most people don't want illegal immigration, but many support increased legal immigration. Get rid of the H1B cap, make it easier to get a green card, but at the same time, make it harder to cross the border illegally. Strengthen ICE and increase the number of visas given.\n\nAll of these areas were deemphasized in favor of negative things about Trump. Talk about a lack of a bold agenda was dismissed. The Democrats became the party of the status quo, and that was a very unappealing pitch. Without Dems telling voters how they would fix real problems with the country, any voter who didn't feel great would vote for Trumo as the change candidate.",

Even this sub decided to put on a tech-hating performance; you would think that people in tech were Nazis despite SV being a fairly liberal place.

We need a Frank Underwood, LBJ esque politician who's muscular and aggressive. If Democrats take this as a sign of \"only because she's a woman\" then all is lost already.

So Biden went big.\n\nInstead inflation came along and threw the economy off.  Now voters blame him for an economy that is still amazing by global standards.\n\nHe thought inflation would cool down fast enough for him to take credit for a good economy but inflation did permanent damage to his image and he never recovered.

Note that the last immigration reform happened in 86 under Reagan!\n\n\nThe shares are actually staggering: half of all agricultural workers are here illegally, and IIRC the share is around 1/3 in construction. The H-2A temporary migrant worker program supplies maybe about 10-20% of workers, because it is very slow and expensive.\n\n\nAnd neither side can honestly and seriously talk about the issue. The immigration skeptics on the right will harp on about how, if we didn't have migrant workers, farms will just raise wages so that natives will work there. Maybe. We would have to raise wages to ludicrous levels probably. Turns out, people REALLY REALLY hate agricultural field work.\u00a0\n\n\nFarms are required to send job postings to state workforce agencies before applying for a H-2A visa, and response rates from unemployed Americans are incredibly low. Those who show up almost all quit after several days, and most don't show up at all.\n\n\nSo, knowing this, what would you do?",

To begin with, I very much dispute the idea that Rogan is a died-in-the-wool Republican with an axe to grind. If the belief is that listening to Rogan causes the Spotify algorithm to send you to Tucker Carlson and The Daily Wire, I would argue that this is at least partly because with a few exceptions like Bernie Sanders and Matt Yglesias, left-leaning people generally refuse to go on his show. I don't particularly care for Rogan, but he's not Tucker Carlson or Ben Shapiro.\n\nBut at the risk of having the ball moved on me, I will name several examples.\n\nFirst and foremost, there is the NPR \"podcast industrial complex\" that is absolutely massive. Putting aside the explicitly political politics based podcasts, you have very successful culture type podcasts like Sam Sanders' thing, like Code Switch, like Snap Judgement, like Bullseye with Jesse Thorn.\n\nOn the subject of Jesse Thorne, he has is own podcast industrial complex in r/MaximumFun. The MaxFun shows are a mixed bag of chatty comedy, high-concept goofs, and occasional discussions of culture and politics, but nearly everyone on the network is almost painfully left-leaning. (I say this as someone who actually went to MaxFunCon once.)\n\nIf you want to be more \"Rogan Like\" there are YouTube streamer types like Destiny, left-leaning liberal types with a very crass, independent streak. (Also, the Vlog Brothers are hardly in the closet. They're opinions are well known, they just choose to keep it apolitical for stylistic reasons.) People like Mark Maron have been talking about bullshit and wearing their Dem leaning credentials for decades now.\n\nIf you want anti-Trump liberals who make their nut primarily by talking about internet bullshit, there is Katie Herzog and Jesse Singal who are wildly successful with Blocked and Reported. \n\nLet's also not forget that Jon Stewart has been back for a while, in podcast form, and is quite popular.\n\nAgain, I'm aware that none of these people may be the True Scotsmen you're looking for, but the point is simply that left leaning people of all stripes are not short on options when it comes to the podcast industrial complex. Retreating to that complex or just adding another podcast \"but different\" to that ecosystem is not the answer.\n\n**edit:** Whoah. I *barely* even know who Destiny is. Like, I'm aware he has a show, a particular set of politics, and a dedicated subreddit, and not much else.\n\nCan someone loop me into what internet drama his fans created that caused someone to create an AutoModerator bot?",

         "It's not crazy, it's a trend that's been going on for a long time. It was silly of Democrats to believe that brown person = Democrat here in Texas (and yes that was a very common belief around 2004-2008, that as Texas became less white it would become bluer).",
         "It becomes less crazy when you realize that this sudden shift began in 2020. Back in 2016, Hillary Clinton won by a very comfortable margin of 79.12%. In 2020, only 52.06% voted for Biden. Looking at the numbers, it seems that the reason comes down to an increase in turnout for Trump since roughly the same number oof people voted blue in both elections for this county.",
         "As a Kamala voter this doesn't shock me. Illegal immigration is the #1 political rat poison issue that killed the Democrats this cycle. Yeah inflation hurt worse but it's not like Biden can just wave the anti inflation magic wand so they had to take that one on the chin. There's not much they could have done about that but there was a hell of a lot they could have done to keep from getting annihilated on the issue of border security. Crying about how you can't do anything on the border because the mean Republicans won't let you pass a weak border bill that no one was enthusiastic about is just awful political leadership. There's a reason why this was the major talking point Trump and Vance tried to harp on during the debates. Their campaign knew how shitty the optics were for Kamala and they capitalised on that. Biden sent 1500 troops to the border for about 3 months in 2023 when title 42 was about to expire. That's the type of thing he should have been doing from day one, except it should have been 15,000 troops there permanently. I don't want to hear about how that's \"bad policy\" or \"not the correct solution to the border problem\" or whatever. Who cares? Even if it's not a perfect solution the point is that it's a solution. Sometimes you need to take a populist view of these issues and do things purely for the sake of demonstrating strength and decisiveness. Doing basically fuck all on the border for four years and letting crossings skyrocket was such an insane optics fumble. In terms of political damage it was equivalent of Trump's awful covid response that cost him the 2020 election.",

It didn\u2019t matter who was running on the republican side, who people vote for reflects their day to day opinion of the world.

Things right now are not OK for most. \n\nI am not saying that their assessment is correct that the Democrats were to blame for these issues, but a democrat president was in power during this time. We have flashbulb memories. In voters eyes, Kamala would just have been a continuation. People being flabbergasted that other people would vote for a felonious, lying criminal don\u2019t realize that many are willing to overlook personal defects if their current situation is poor.

It\u2019s one of the reasons the crazy Protestants like the Westboro Baptist Church still hate Catholics and especially the Vatican so much, they see it as a liberalizing force within Christianity.\n\nUltimately, I think the Catholic Church doesn\u2019t fit nicely into the modern conservative/liberal dichotomy because its institutions are hundreds of years older than the concept of liberalism.",

         "In this podcast, Frank Fukuyama speaks with Yascha Mounk about the election of Donald Trump, his authoritarian tendencies, and the rise of tech oligarchs like Elon Musk.\n\n  \nOne topic they speak extensively on is the authoritarian tendencies of Trump and what it would look like in practice.\n\n\n\n>**Mounk**: Let's get to the heart of the matter. How dangerous is Donald Trump going to be for America's democratic institutions over the course of the last four years? How should we think about assessing the extent of that danger?\n\n>**Fukuyama**: Well, I think the primary threat is to the rule of law. He's been very clear in the last few months and weeks that he's really out for revenge. He wants to take revenge on all the people that he believes have been prosecuting him and or persecuting him. And I think that this is where Schedule F really matters because, in his first term, he couldn't get his own Justice Department to go after Hillary Clinton, even though he wanted them to. But he understands that that was a weakness of his first term. And I think he's going to put people in key positions in the Justice Department that will enable them to open up investigations.\u00a0\n\n>Let me just give you one concrete example. The head of the IRS is subject to what they call \u201cfor cause dismissal,\u201d meaning that he's got to commit some crime or some really overt offense before you can fire him. Schedule F is going to get rid of that. There are hundreds of these \u201cfor cause\u201d positions throughout the government. So if Trump can fire the head of the IRS, and put a loyalist in there, then you could open up a tax audit against a journalist or head of an NGO or the NGO itself, that will be incredibly harassing and will tie the organization or the individual up in all sorts of legal fees. So, you're not talking about a Putin-style putting everybody in a gulag, but you are giving the executive incredible power against individuals and against organizations. And I think that that'll be kind of one of the primary lines of attack.",

Oh boy, bring in the public shaming.  The state chairman openly mocked and shamed Haley delegates.  Totally unamerican and unprofessional.  They even started a party newspaper called the \"Trumpet\" with the letter \"e\" in a weird font so the \"Trump\" is more noticeable.  That fact that I was seemingly the only one not disgusted by such chicanery was not a good sign for any independent thinkers  still left in party.\n\nI was raised Christian and that party full on embraced idolatry.

We knew that after 2016, but this really drilled it home.\n\nWhile I'm on my soapbox, Democrats should never, ever have a coronation for another instead of a primary again. Clinton running in an empty primary was dumb, Biden running again with a 39% approval rating at 82 years old and clearing the primary was dumb.

People are not dumb, and the fact that apparently huge swathes of the D leadership and core supporters think they are is a big part of the problem.\n\nI can't believe I'm seeing this, but apparently the collective takeaway from drastically underperforming down ballot races (where exit polls said you hammered the least important big issue and ignored the two that were 3x as important), the down ballot races being a beating where the other side will have a full majority, and losing core party demographics is \"I played that perfectly but people are stupid and were never going to vote for the incumbent in this economy,\" with a few people going \"the reason why that happened is that we just weren't leftist enough.

If you want to change an organization, you need to hold out to try to make changes while being the minority.  You need to stay and fight.  But at a certain point, it's a hopeless mission.

Trump made massive gains in the minority vote and won moderates.\n\nWisconsin, Michigan, Nevada, Georgia, and Arizona had record turnout. North Carolina and Pennsylvania were within 1% of record turnout. The total turnout is looking very, very close to 2020 which was the best since 1908 (and would beat all post 1908 elections besides 2020). Some D+ infinity areas didn't show up (and not all, CA is on pace to crush records), but it's been massively overstated in early post mortems. People showed up to vote.

      "title": "This election wasn\u2019t lost because of your least favorite interest group",
      "text": "In the coming days, dozens of post-mortems will be published trying to dissect why the Democrats lost. Fingers will be pointed everywhere, and more likely than not everyone will look for a myriad of reasons why the Democrats lost, be it certain issues, campaigns strategies, constituencies defecting, etc. This election will be viewed as a catastrophic failure of the Democratic Party on brand with 2004. Every commentator across the political spectrum will claim that had the Democrats just gone with their preferred strategy, then Kamala would be President-elect right now.\n\nI think it\u2019s safe to say that all of that is reading too much into it. The Democratic Party was in complete array. Progressives, liberals, moderates, centrists, whoever, fell in line behind Kamala as the candidate. Fundraising was through the roof, the ground game had a massive amount of energy and manpower in it, and Democratic excitement was palpable.\n\nBy all accounts, the Democrats showed up and showed out for this election across the board. Unfortunately, that isn\u2019t enough. It kept the bottom from falling out like in 1972 or 1980, but the vast majority of independent and swing voters broke for the Republicans. A majority of the nation, for the first time in 20 years, put their faith in the governance of the Republican Party.\n\nThe median voter exists in an odd, contradictory vortex of mismatched beliefs and priors that cannot be logically discerned or negotiated. You just have to take them at their word. If they say they don\u2019t like inflation, it\u2019s because they believe that Biden is making the burgers more expensive. No amount of explaining why Trump\u2019s economic policies are terrible, or why Biden\u2019s policies were needed to avoid a massive post-COVID recession, or why they\u2019re actually making a paycheck that offsets inflation, will win them over. \n\nIn view of this, it was probably impossible for Kamala to win. She secured the Democratic base, made crossover appeals, and put forward some really good policies. And it worked. Her favorables are quite good, higher than Trump\u2019s, and it\u2019s obvious that she outperformed whatever Biden was walking into. Her campaign had flaws, certainly, but none nearly as obvious and grievous as Trump\u2019s. \n\nKamala being perceived as too liberal didn\u2019t matter. The Democrats being too friendly to Israel (or not friendly enough) didn\u2019t matter. Cultural issues didn\u2019t matter. Jill Stein didn\u2019t matter. Praising Dick Cheney didn\u2019t matter. The reality of the American economy didn\u2019t matter. If issue polling is correct, even immigration didn\u2019t really matter, and is mostly viewed as a proxy for the economy. \n\nWhat mattered was that 67% of voters thought the economy was doing poorly, in spite of most of them thinking that their own financial situation was fine. Voters want to see a low price tag on groceries, a DoorDash fee of $10, and a 3,500 sq. ft. house on the market for $250k, even if it means 10% unemployment and low wages for workers. Of those things, they associate it most with Trump, as much of a mirage as that is, and were willing to accept everything else for the chance to have that back. This election isn\u2019t a victory of all of Trumpism necessarily, or even a complete failure of the Democrats. It\u2019s a reminder of the priorities of the voters that will decide the election, in spite of how good your campaign was, or how economically sound your actually policies were. There\u2019s a hell of a lot that people will look past in order to have a cheap burger again.\n\nIf there is a failure, it\u2019s that Democrats spent to long believing that there could ever be a return of civility and normality. There was a clear and evident reluctance to use the full power of the state against the insurrectionists and crooks, chief among them Donald Trump. Biden thought that he could restore the soul of the nation and get people to respect and value the unwritten rules of politics that have guided us through the current liberal era. As it turns out, voters don\u2019t even care for the written ones.\n\nDon\u2019t blame the progressive, or the liberal, or the centrist Democratic voter. This election wasn\u2019t really on them. They voted. They probably donated, walked the blocks, or did some phone banking. They did what they were supposed to. If liberalism is to weather the coming storm, it will need the tent to stay intact, readjust, and come back stronger for 2026 and 2028. ",

Dems spent trillions on a progressive wishlist. There's no way that Dems didn't contribute just a little bit to inflation. Not just that, but what spending they did do had to be talked down to please Joe Machin.\n\nThen there was this rethinking of traditional antitrust laws where instead of believing in the consumer welfare standard, progressives believed that breaking up companies for the curse of being too big should take precedence. Progressives wanted to \"fight\" big tech and even though those companies were producing services that people love for a reasonable price, but they're \"big\" and \"wealthy\" so government had to go after them. All it did was make enemies out of traditional allies and gain them nothing in return. But who cares as long as the government is \"fighting\".\n\nThe lurch to the left hurt the country economically, chased allies out of the party and towards the GOP,  and made Dems more insufferable.",

Centrists accuse the losing side of being too leftist. \nWhen the right wing lost (Brazil 2022/USA 2020) the reaction of the losing side was to immediately assume the election was stolen.\nThis shows how solipsistic their narratives are.

And they've got a massive advantage now that they have successfully established themselves as the \"anti-establishment\". \n\nSo yeah, center/left have to start painting a prettier picture, telling a more attractive story.

         "This is spot on. The average American doesn't spend their time reading economic literature, or have any desire to have a deeper understanding of macro-economics or international trade agreements. The majority of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck, and plugged into one of the various 24hr news cycles. Grocery prices, home prices, and rent have all gone up, and no-one can even believe that COVID could have caused that. Because COVID was in 2020 and we're in 2024, and gas was cheap during COVID so that couldn't be the reason things were expensive now. \n\nWe're in a populism era, where people are desperate for anything other than what we've been doing for the last 70 years. The \"establishment\" is the enemy, and any change is good, even if it's disastrous to a sizable portion of Americans. \n\nYou can't convince someone that \"line goes up\" means the economy is doing well when they're struggling to pay their bills. \n\nYou can't convince someone that \"immigrants are good for the economy\" when they exist in communities with almost no immigration. \n\nYou can't convince the people who watch CNN/Fox/MSNBC that crime rates are down when every single car-jacking, assault, and murder that happens 1000 miles from their house is plastered on the TV to increase viewership. \n\nYou can't convince people that \"Democrats actually have better economic policy\" when they look at the insane rates of homelessness in big cities in states like California and Illinois.\n\nThere is too much access to information that doesn't matter to most Americans, but that information will absolutely warp their perception of the world they're in. For any progressive or liberal ideas to have a chance of success ever again in the US, California and Illinois need to get their shit together. Illinois has been on a pretty good trajectory with paying off it's interstate debts, and raising a ton of cash as a rainy day fund, but JB needs to SLASH property taxes to even start to sway public opinion within the state. I moved from the Chicago area to Southern Illinois for a great job opportunity, and the vitriol down here for the northern half of the state is INSANE. And the #1 thing that people complain about besides the gun laws is the property taxes, and how it makes homeownership so difficult even in low COL areas. There aren't enough people to really have a huge demand on housing down here, and almost every one of the towns around me have plenty of mixed use buildings and walkable areas.\n\nAdd in the fact that there is a huge portion of the country that has existed in states with such deep seated bigotry/racism and religious fanaticism to the point that I'd argue that many of them don't even realize the bias they have, and you begin to realize that a female POC candidate never stood a chance.\n\nI know that over the next 4 years, that outside of any policies that will affect the overall economy, as a straight white guy working in the Military Industrial Complex, I won't have too much hardship. I'll be miserable enough with some of the proposed policies directly attacking people in my life who I care about.  I'll keep doing what I can to fight the good fight, by donating to causes that help the groups that are going to suffer the most under Trump, and by continuing to vote in every election. \n\nMaybe in 2028 the DNC will have gotten the memo that they need to have candidates that are palatable to the majority of Americans, and stop trying to win elections by catering to the \"College Educated\" upper-middle class. Dems need to very publicly step it up for the blue-collar folks over the next 4 years, and plaster their successes all over every podcast and social media platform they can.",

Her platform is outcomes people want but with the only policy mentions being things the Biden admin did not things she was going to do. She has had the same problem since she was AG. I'm sure she has policy positions she holds but she doesn't talk about them, she seems to defer to people running her campaigns to put fluffy stuff up.

So much of her campaign focused on how terrible Trump was/is, combined with the usual anti price-gouging and \"he'll cut taxes for rich people, I'll cut taxes for **you**\" palaver. Trump's campaign tried as hard as they could to tie Harris to the Biden administration to take advantage of anti-incumbency sentiment. **That** is the message the Harris campaign needed to repudiate, and you can't sit there and tell me with a straight face that they did a good job in that department.\n\nWas she correct about Trump being awful? Yes. Did she hammer it effectively? Yes. But in the end, was she telling people what they already knew? Also yes. The campaign focused on giving people reasons not to vote for Trump, and less on giving people reasons to vote for her. That doesn't work with an electorate easily swayed by populism.\n\n> The theory for why Harris should focus on bread-and-butter issues instead of Trump\u2019s autocratic ambitions is simple: Nine years after Trump launched his first presidential campaign, voters already know what they think about him. And if undecided voters still aren\u2019t convinced that Trump is an authoritarian menace, they probably can\u2019t be persuaded on that point. After all, Trump-curious voters remember Democrats issuing apocalyptic warnings in 2016, yet did not personally suffer nor witness any political repression during his time in office. To the contrary, they tend to recall life under Trump as utterly normal \u2014 at least, before the worldwide pandemic for which, in their view, he had little responsibility.

He praised tech companies for their innovation and was on good terms with Elon Musk. He didn't have a problem with Sheryl Sandberg being influential with a sliver of Dems like a lot of progressives do. He didn't have a problem with Wall Street execs working in his administration, as long as they worked toward his vision. He didn't start fights with groups just because he thought they were \"too powerful\" because that's stupid.\n\nAll of that is why modern day progressives hate Obama - he didn't cosplay as a warrior. Biden and the Dems did not do any of the above and it made them nothing but enemies, ran Democratic allies towards the right, and got them no concrete wins. There's a good chance the Biden's legacy will be erased in the next Congress. And for what? Because progressives want a more ideologically pure party?

      "text": "",
      "comments": [
         "This article makes no sense to me tbh. It tries really hard to make a narrative about 'the west' that's really mostly (but not exclusively) an American phenomenon.\n\n> Even so, across western democracies the anger carousel is spinning ever faster as like-minded movements learn from the Trump playbook\n\nThe populist right-wing in Europe has grown slowly over decades, and does not owe itself to Trump. The Brexit vote is probably the biggest ticket 'anger' vote in Europe over the last decade, and it predates him by a year. The UK's attempts at a similarily 'post-truth' governance approach in the Brexit aftermath resulted in two of the most disastrous premierships in living memory with near universal public rejection, leaving a conventional-coded banker to clean up the mess. And then trying to fit Keir Starmer, the most boring, conventional dude ever invented into a narrative about how angry western politics are is as laughable as it is failed. Where the European rightwing has gained power or gotten close, it's in large part because they've temperamentally moderated into parties that don't trigger people's disgust reflexes as hard. Meloni and Le Pen, two of the most successful right-wing politicians, try their hardest to seem like 'normal' politicians who are just very anti-immigration. The trend in most right-wing parties has been towards increased moderation in all areas except immigration in order to widen their appeal. In Poland, the angry populists lost the elections and got booted out in favor of a political heavyweight veteran. According to current polling, Hungary might be headed the same way. I don't see this broad movement towards rage really.",
         "> \u201cAnger is right. Anger works. Anger clarifies, cuts through, and captures the essence of the evolutionary spirit.\u201d Well OK, Gordon Gekko was a money guy, so his famed Wall Street speech was about greed. Had he instead been a politician, he would know with equal conviction that, today, anger is the driving energy of politics.  It has always had a role. Oppositions need anger to drive out incumbents. But what perhaps is most striking about modern politics is that it has gradually become a permanent feature. \n\n> This is not to say that all the rage is irrational. Anger alone will not do the job unless it is linked to the right cause and the best of those is voters\u2019 sense of falling living standards. Immigration is another, though in part it too is a function of economic dissatisfaction. Donald Trump won for largely conventional reasons, powered particularly by the high inflation of the Biden years. In the UK, Keir Starmer harnessed anger over inflation and public services. It would be a poor politician who did otherwise. \n\n> It is not absurd for voters to place more weight on their lived economic experience than those who quote the data at them. Similarly, Brexit looks foolish as a policy response. But viewed as a choice between the status quo and change, you can see why people who felt things were not working chose the camp which acknowledged their concerns.\n\n> Even so, across western democracies the anger carousel is spinning ever faster as like-minded movements learn from the Trump playbook. It is driven not only by politicians but by a partisan media ecosystem whose economic model depends on keeping their audience in a state of permanent mobilisation, fuelled by culture wars and paranoid hyperbole about enemy elites within. TV channels, podcasters, bloggers and websites need that constant crisis to maintain audiences. Confrontational rhetoric is incentivised with clicks. Why else has anyone heard of Lauren Boebert And while the right is better at this, the left is also learning.\n\n> This has corrosive consequences that go way beyond election outcomes. In opposition it is easy. The enemy is the incumbent. But even in power the ecosystem must be fed enemies who provide alibis for failure. You need malign bureaucrats, woke elites, globalist financiers, partisan judges. Ultimately, this erodes belief in the entire system. Millions of Americans have, after all, just concluded that safeguarding democracy was less important than the other things Trump offers. The anger carousel also loves binary issues which bind in supporters. Is it a coincidence that even when voters insist their central concern is the economy, so much discourse is ever more dominated by matters which lend themselves to an absolutist debate: Brexit, Scottish independence, abortion, trans-rights, gun control, immigration, Israel/Gaza, the retreat from net zero?\n\n> This leads to the othering of your opponents, to the dehumanising language of \u201cdeplorables\u201d and \u201cgarbage\u201d, of Marxists, fascists and treason. It also serves parties in electoral systems where the choice is binary and when complete power can be won with less than a majority of votes. This is not only a right-wing phenomenon but progressives, too prone to blinkered moralising, are less effective at it. Is there a way past this? Only by finding ways to quell the anger. Clearly a vibrant economy is the best medicine, but only if it raises all boats. Boris Johnson\u2019s levelling-up agenda proved empty, but the recognition that even in boom times too many areas were being left behind was a crucial insight. \n\n> But beyond that, the core duty must be taking seriously the concerns of the voters the other side is targeting. Some will always be beyond reach. But many need not be. Fighting the anger and the betrayal narratives means reconnecting with those who believe you have stopped listening to them. The opportunities grasped by the radical right come from identifying the ordinary voters progressives have left behind. The liberal elite was never a complete fiction. One reason why Starmer won (aside from the immense help gifted him by the Conservative government) is that he paid attention to those voters Labour had lost, accepting their concerns on immigration and Brexit, and focusing on the economy, though some constraints may hobble his ambitions for growth. \n\n> Even if they draw back from Trump\u2019s most egregious constitutional abuses, populist parties can see the electoral value of permanent anger, bolstered by a media and social media system with a vested interest in an approach which has little use for compromise or constructive opposition.  If this were only about who is up or down electorally it would matter less. But permanently mobilised anger is a threat to the stability of the system and quelling it is a democratic imperative.",

By all measures, inflation is *down*. You could credibly claim to have \u201csolved inflation\u201d and be correct.\n\nBut most people, when they hear inflation is down, would expect the cost of groceries to go from $125 to $100. *THAT* would be solving inflation, not merely slowing the rate of increase.\n\nSo when people heard the Biden admin tout \u201cinflation is down\u201d, then they go to the store and still see high prices, they think, \u201cBiden\u2019s & the Dems are full of shit, prices haven\u2019t come back down, they\u2019re still high!\u201d\n\nFor people to have thought the economy is good, they didn\u2019t just need to slow inflation.

         "This jerking off of Trump as a genius I think is silly. He won, yes, but I think that was despite being himself. This article ignores the most fundamental part of this election which was inflation. Time and time again Biden and Kamala tried to combat the inflation issue but it just never took because, well, at the end of the day prices were higher today then they were a year ago. It\u2019s just a global phenomenon that\u2019s been obliterating incumbents left and right, no matter how well they campaign or how popular they started off. I think Trump restrained the GOP from having a historic victory with Virginia, Minnesota, New Mexico, New Hampshire and possibly other blue states flip to a respectable one where the results were in line with what analysts expected as one of the two main possibilities (though I think the popular vote margins are the big shocker).\n\nI will say the critiques of Biden I far more agree with. He was slow and weak on the immigration issue that proved to be a lifeline to the GOP. He maintained his progressive views that played well with the base but didn\u2019t land well with independents and moderates and all that. So on and so forth.\n\nUltimately though I think this was a fundamentally anti-Dem environment where we did about as well as we could have given the circumstances. That we prevented Trump from flipping bluer states, kept the House within single digits and the Senate a small GOP majority is probably about as well as we could\u2019ve realistically done given the results we got",
         "Article:\n\n\nIf you think Donald Trump is too crass or cruel or incompetent to be president\u2014if you are disappointed or even astonished that, having tried and failed to subvert the will of the people in the last election, he has come back to win fair and square\u2014you should be asking yourself this question: why, to so many Americans, does the Democratic Party seem worse?\n\n\nThis victory is a tremendous achievement for Mr Trump, who after his loss in 2020 and the attack on the Capitol on January 6th 2021 was counted out even by leaders of his own party. At the time Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican leader, who privately regarded Mr Trump as \u201ca sleazeball\u201d and \u201cstupid\u201d, called the insurrection \u201cfurther evidence of Donald Trump\u2019s complete unfitness for office\u201d, according to reporting he has not disputed in a new biography by Michael Tackett, a journalist.\n\n\nYet what might seem a psychological frailty\u2014an inability to brook criticism or concede mistakes, much less defeat\u2014has for Mr Trump been a mighty source of political strength, one that intensifies his connection to the voters he has made the base of the Republican Party. As in 2016, Mr Trump wielded his command of that bloc of voters this year to clear a path through crowded Republican primaries, and then relied upon \u201cnegative polarisation\u201d, or fear of the other guys, to unite the party. \u201cCan you believe he endorsed me?\u201d Mr Trump chortled at a rally in North Carolina on November 3rd, gloating over how Mr McConnell eventually fell into line. Mr Trump felt no obligation to reciprocate. \u201cHopefully we get rid of Mitch McConnell pretty soon,\u201d he said.\n\n\nMr Trump has shown courage, not only in weathering assassins\u2019 attacks but in insisting on views on trade, entitlements and other matters that a few years ago were heresy within his party. With his sophisticated grasp of new and legacy media and his instinct for the basic needs and fears of many Americans, he has revolutionised how American politics is conducted and shifted the policy terrain over which it is waged. In terms of disrupting what came before, he has had more effect than even Ronald Reagan.\n\n\nUnlike Reagan\u2014or the other two-term presidents since, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama\u2014Mr Trump has never been very popular, though he managed, in this third run as the Republican nominee, at last to win the popular vote. Unlike those predecessors, Mr Trump has relied upon division, not addition, for his electoral maths. In his first term his average approval rating of 41% was the lowest ever measured by the Gallup Poll, which began tracking the statistic under Harry Truman. Democrats have good reason to think Mr Trump repels many voters when he calls adversaries \u201cvermin\u201d or \u201cthe enemy from within\u201d or says illegal immigrants are \u201cpoisoning the blood of our country\u201d.\n\n\nYet, after this victory, whatever disdain Democrats have for Mr Trump should be cause only for humility and self-scrutiny. As in 2016, Mr Trump\u2019s broad support will present his adversaries with a Rorschach test in which they can see their preferred image of America, and it will be ugly. For some, white supremacy and misogyny will explain Mr Trump\u2019s success, while others may attribute it to tax cuts and greed. Some will conclude that poor, non-white or female Americans have been ensorcelled into voting against their self-interest. Rather than retreat into some grand theory, they would so better ro think through how, in a divided country, President Joe Biden might have nudged the balance a few points away from Mr Trump, rather than to him. Kamala Harris was no bystander, but pime responsibility lies with the president she served.\n\n\nMr Biden did not heed his own warnings about Mr Trump. He tried to eat into Mr Trump\u2019s support with blue-collar workers through giant investments in manufacturing and infrastructure that offered something to everyone. But, unlike Mr Clinton or Mr Obama, he ducked choices that would have respected the concerns of most Americans but disappointed left-wing Democrats. A political strategy of addition still requires some division.\n\n\nMost egregious, Mr Biden resharpened Mr Trump\u2019s most effective political wedge by doing away with obstacles he had created to illegal immigration, with no alternative. By the time he restored some of Mr Trump\u2019s restrictions this spring, more than 4m migrants had crossed the southern border, compared with fewer than 1m under Mr Trump. That was terrible for the Democrats as a party, and worse for people they want to help and the cause they believe in: under Mr Biden, Americans who say they want a decrease in legal immigration rose from a minority to a majority, as did the number who favour mass deportation.\n\n\n**How to defend democracy**\n\nEven where Mr Biden had accomplishments that undermined Mr Trump\u2019s arguments, he let himself be constrained by his party\u2019s loudest activists. Oil production rose to record levels, but Mr Biden did not boast about that. He was also no longer up to the demands of presidential communication that Mr Trump understands so well. He was not constantly, energetically promoting his success in sustaining economic growth and raising wages. His approval rating sagged as low as 36% just as other Democrats were forcing him to face the obvious: he should not be running again. In the short time Ms Harris had, she waged a good campaign. But any politician would have struggled under such burdens. She could not separate herself enough from Mr Biden, or from the video Mr Trump\u2019s ads used, to devastating effect, of her recently declaring positions that were alienating to most Americans.\n\n\n\u201cWe have learned again that democracy is precious,\u201d Mr Biden proudly declared during his inaugural address almost four years ago. \u201cDemocracy is fragile. And at this hour, my friends, democracy has prevailed.\u201d Now it has prevailed again. Will Democrats get the message this time?",
         "I think this is generally the correct approach to addressing the democrats loses this election cycle.\n\nYes, we need to learn from this election. Focus on winning back the working class and Hispanic voters. Yes, the Biden and Harris campaigns made mistakes. \n\nBut fundamentally, the overall political environment, largely influenced by inflation, is what killed us. Obviously, the next four years are going to be bad, but in two years, the democrats are basically certain to win back the house, unless Trump manages to deflate the prices without causing a recession. \n\nEven though we lost this election, I think it's important to not start throwing away correct policies that at most had a marginal impact on the election, i.e. trans rights, green energy, etc.",
         "I think this is absolutely the correct take, but I would add immigration as another accellerant.\u00a0 There was a historic rise in immigration that overwhelmed social services across the US, and in the immediate aftermath of Covid when many services and communities were already reeling.\u00a0 Biden, and the like minded community (that means us) were too slow to recognize and adddress the reality and couldn't get past the rhetoric that open borders are better than closed borders.\u00a0 When Biden finally acted, it was literally years after Abbot and Meatball Ron had started their high profile bussing.\u00a0\u00a0",

         "> Yet what might seem a psychological frailty\u2014an inability to brook criticism or concede mistakes, much less defeat\u2014has for Mr Trump been a mighty source of political strength\n\nI would go a step further and point out that because of those qualities, Trump is able to talk confidently on issues without much concern for if he'll be factually correct or not. \n\nThe Right gave Harris flack for not talking about her policies, or not answering interview questions. The fact of the matter is, if Harris wasn't sure about something offhand, she'd pivot to something else, or tell people to view her policies on her website.\n\nIf Trump was asked about something he didn't know, he would just talk about what he feels the right answer is. People would jump on that for being wrong, or lying, or misinformation. But the simple truth is that kind of response just looks better than avoiding an answer in an attempt to be accurate. Biden did the same thing, and his gaffes didn't cost him his election. Voters don't mind gaffes, they don't care if you're wrong about something, so long as you show that you care about their issues and want to help them.",

There are very bad downstream effects of doing so (such as the loss of democracy for everyone who acted responsibly) the violation of which are arguably are more important in a normative sense than providing democracy to everyone unconditionally.\n\nOne cannot ignore the positive aspects of normative statements.

In 2022,\u00a0the United States was chosen\u00a0as the international partner in that project, which is to be located in\u00a0Choczewo on the Baltic coast.\n\n>PiS was removed from power in December 2023, but the new government, led by Donald Tusk, has committed itself to continuing its predecessor\u2019s nuclear ambitions.\n\n>In September, it\u00a0published plans to spend 60 billion zloty\u00a0(\u20ac13.9 billion) by 2030 on developing Poland\u2019s first nuclear plant, with construction now slated to begin in 2028.\n\n>\n\n>The PiS government also put in place plans for a second nuclear power plant, and ahead of today\u2019s memorandum some media outlets in both Japan and Poland had reported that Japan would be picked as the international partner in that project.\n\n>However, on Wednesday afternoon, Poland\u2019s industry ministry announced that, \u201ccontrary to reports in some media, \\[the memorandum with Japan\\] does not mean the conclusion of agreements related to the construction of a second nuclear power plant\u201d.\n\n>Instead, it \u201cconcerns broadly understood cooperation in the field of nuclear energy\u201d, including \u201ccooperation at the level of economic entities and industrial technologies, the exchange of information, organisation of workshops, social communication on nuclear safety and technological support\u201d.\n\n>Business Insider Polska also reports that the memorandum will lead to cooperation in Poland\u2019s\u00a0development of so-called small modular nuclear reactors\u00a0(SMRs), though the ministry has not publicly commented on that.\n\n>Poland has one of\u00a0Europe\u2019s most polluting energy sectors, with the country relying on coal for\u00a0almost two thirds of its electricity generation last year. Both the current and former governments have planned for a\u00a0mix of nuclear and renewables to replace coal\u00a0over the coming decades.",

      "text": "",
      "comments": [
         "> The Bank of England cut its key interest rate for the second time this year, saying it was increasingly confident that inflation is coming under control. The Monetary Policy Committee voted decisively to lower the Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points to 4.75 percent. External member Catherine Mann, typically the most hawkish voice on the MPC, cast the only vote for no change. But it warned that it now sees inflation staying above its 2 percent target for longer than previously, due partly to the new Labour government\u2019s spending plans. \u201cThere has been continued progress in disinflation, particularly as previous external shocks have abated,\u201d the Bank said in a statement.  But it warned that \u201cremaining domestic inflationary pressures are resolving more slowly.\u201d It repeated that \u201ca gradual approach to removing policy restraint remains appropriate,\u201d and said that policy \u201cwill need to continue to remain restrictive for sufficiently long until the risks to inflation returning sustainably to the 2 percent target in the medium term have dissipated further.\u201d \u201cWe need to make sure inflation stays close to target, so we can\u2019t cut interest rates too quickly or by too much,\u201d said Governor Andrew Bailey.\n\n> The headline rate of inflation fell to 1.7 percent in September, comfortably below the Bank\u2019s medium target. It also cut its forecast for year-end inflation, now seen at 2.4 percent versus the 2.7 percent it had predicted in August. But the Bank now estimates it will take a lot longer to return to target sustainably. While in August the BoE had expected that by the start of 2026, its new median forecast only sees it happening in the second quarter of 2027, a full 18 months later. Part of this is down to Chancellor Rachel Reeves\u2019s autumn budget, which promises an extra \u00a370 billion in spending next year. In its new Monetary Policy Report, the Bank wrote that it expects the budget to push inflation up by just under 0.5 percentage points at its peak in a year\u2019s time. The extra government spending is also expected to boost gross domestic product by about 0.75 percentage points.\n\n> Conspicuously absent from the MPR was any explicit mention of Donald Trump and his wide-ranging tariff proposals. The Republican president-elect only became the clear winner by the time the Bank had already convened on Wednesday, but he\u2019s been vocal about his desire to renew the trade war he started in his first term in office, floating tariffs of 10 or 20 percent across the board on all of America\u2019s trade partners. The BoE didn\u2019t directly address the threat to trade relations between the UK and its largest single export market, but it did write that, while expects import prices to take longer to come down than it previously thought. \u201cTaken together these effects are expected to raise UK [headline] inflation by 0.2 [percentage points] relative to the August report,\u201d it writes. Export prices and currency exchange rates have stayed subdued in recent months, the Bank noted, but it flagged the possibility of \u201clarge movements in sterling or in world export prices in the future, or in the presence of large and heterogenous shocks in the prices of different goods.\u201d\n\n> The Bank stressed multiple times that there was extreme uncertainty over the future path of inflation. Data for the labor market in particular \u201care difficult to interpret\u201d while growth in wages \u201chas been more elevated than usual relationships would predict.\u201d The  Office for National Statistics has been warning that the quality of its labor data has declined because fewer people are answering its surveys. Recent disinflationary pressure has been concentrated in more volatile categories like energy. As that effect fades, the downward pressure on prices will ease. Inflation in the prices of services, meanwhile, is expected to remain \u201cbroadly unchanged\u201d over the next six months. Service prices are closely linked to wages. The Bank wrote that while average weekly earnings had \u201cfallen back significantly\u201d since the middle of the year, they remained elevated, growing at an annual pace of 4.8 percent in the three months to August.\n\n!ping UK",

         "Thats because POTUS does have limits on tariff authority.\n\nThere are three ways they can do it without congress getting involved.\n\n* Get commerce to find a national security reason for a specific tariff. This allows single goods tariffs to protect single industries (eg steel) but takes a year if there are no legal challenges.\n* Decare an emergency. Tariffs can be challenged if they don't relate to the emergency.\n* Tarif is in response to unfair trading practices. USTR investigation is required and only allows targeting of a single country.\n\nFor the broad authority Trump wants congress either has to do it themselves or give him authority. Congress is not going to give him authority because then democrats can use it too. No idea what the votes will be like with congress trying to do it but im not sure its passable.\n\nThere are many things he can mess with easilly but most of the things he has been talking about are things that would take two terms even with full support of congress. The deportations thing he is obsessed with he can't alter parole (IE intern them) for those already granted it and they can't be deported without a hearing which currently has a 5 year backlog.\n\nEven with SCOTUS the way it is the legal challenges for most of the stuff he wants to do would take more than 4 years to resolve. The Texas trick they have been using for headlines can also be used in other districts to slow walk issues like this until his term is up. The Thomas & Trump view of president kings hasn't been true since FDR, unless congress becomes productive again, they are not going to be removing barriers here.\n\nEven the Ukraine funding Democrats simply need to find enough Republicans to support a Ukraine funding bill to bypass him.\n\nTBH I am way more concerned about the executive agencies then anything he has talked about on the campaign trail. Nutritional guidelines cycle has happened to fall over an election this time with the next round due to be published end of next year (5 year cycle) which informs a huge number of programs (school lunches, prison food etc). RFK doing his thing could well be catastrophically bad there.
