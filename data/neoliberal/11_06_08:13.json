         "It\u2019s the stupid 60% requirement in order to pass anything in this god forsaken state. Because of it now when Floridians decide what they actually want the minority gets to wipe their ass with it. \n\nThe vote was 57% yes 43% no. In what rational world does a government say that people don\u2019t want this.",

         "As a Latin American I would love to actually talk to the people there, it seems insane.\nEither they are truly idiots or florida got filled with all the crass rich latinos who only want lower taxes (the idea of lower taxes they don't understand shit of economy) so they can increase their income of selling cheap shit from america to the closed Latin American economies.",
         "Hey, I voted for these things! I'm HIGHLY displeased.\n\nWe need a 60% majority to get anything done. We filled up with the worst sorts of GOP refugees during the lockdown period, which was fully Machiavelli'd by DeSantis for exactly these political reasons. \n\nIf Trump wins, I'd better not hear any bitching from any of his voters around here about a single economic issue affecting them or health insurance or literally anything else, because I have zero empathy for them at this point.",
         "Lift the cuban embargo and embargo florida.",
         "On a more serious note for Florida women, I hope the pro-choice side has a back-up plan here and starts collecting signatures to have a 15-week ban but with all the exceptions initiative for either next year or the midterms in 2026. 15 week bans are dogshit too but whatever it takes to get rid of that vile and scummy 6-week ban Florida will be under.",
         "It sucks so bad. I live here and I tried to convince as many people as I could. Even amendment 2 is fucked up and gives carte blanche to fisherman to decimate our marine life and use barbaric tactics to catch game.

         "So from what I'm hearing, at least for the cannabis vote is that the bill would have primarily been for 2 large companies to move in instead of allowing a lot of competition. A very similar measure occurred in Ohio a few years ago and was eventually passed in a future measure.",

         "I know folks like us scream at these outputs. But I think you just have to see them as how, not stupid, but like disengaged/disconnected voters are. \n\nTo us it's a clear throughline. Want this policy? Why the fuck would you vote red?? But clearly to voters either the connections don't make sense, or abortion/weed aren't important enough issues to sway their votes. \n\nEither way. There'll be lots of politics talks tomorrow wherever you work or go to school and you'll be reminded at how normies know nothing and folks like us are apparently the weird ones. Fuck man. Democracy. Depressing.\n\nPeople vote on vibes, and for sure this include Dem voters. I mean how many people didn't vote Romney in 2012 because of vibes (I'm happy Obama won ofc but I though Romney got portrayed unfairly) about him being cold or whatever. \n\nLike I'm watching these Flagrant clips of Trump (youtube podcast/show with comedians) and like, this is how voters think. Half baked shit. \n\nAnd I think a lot of us are like that also. It's not a coincidence that Pete Butigieg, highly educated, ex-consultant, is one of this sub's favorites! (I love mayor Pete fwiw, but also because he was relatively moderate back then at least)",
         "This isn't even a Florida Republican thing, this is most Republicans in general. Most Republicans vote red because of cultural grievances, made-up vibes, purposeful ignorance, how their parents/family vote, or they are too proud to ever admit the logical faults in how they vote. There is very little alignment between what conservatives claim they want and what the Republican party has/wants to achieve. \n\nI've regularly heard my conservative friends and family, most of which will vote for Trump and understand very little about policies the Democrats and Republicans pursue at the national level, complain about the following:\n\n* Wanting a better healthcare system, despite Democrats being the only party that has ever wanted and achieved legislation to make healthcare more accessible and affordable. \n* Wanting better public transit, despite Democrats being the only party that wants and achieves increased federal funding for transit. \n* Wanting more funding for infrastructure, despite Democrats being the party that wants and achieves increased infrastructure funding.\n* Wanting more domestic manufacturing, despite Democrats achieving a major domestic manufacturing bill. \n* Immigration, despite Republicans purposely nose-diving a very conservative-leaning bill just for political reasons (conservatives have somehow blocked this out of their voting calculus, of course).\n* Cleaner air, despite the Democrats being the main pushers of renewable energy, improved fuel efficiencies, electric vehicles, more sustainable land use patterns, and alternative modes of transportation. \n* Complaining about \"political division\" despite voting for a person who has completely brought on the worst aspect of American political discourse. \n\nThe list goes on. Most Republicans have mentally walled themselves off from ever being able to fairly compare the two parties. They would vote for a Republican 10x worse and more corrupt than Trump if they were on the ballot. \n\nRepublican voters are not like Democrat voters. There is a reason election lies, COVID conspiracy theories, and other blatant falsehoods are so easily spread amongst conservative voters, they are willfully ignorant and okay with creating new realities around themselves. If Trump wins the election, be ready for four years of \"the economy is great\" from conservatives (despite not being able to point to any specific economic policy that Trump has achieved) and thinking that none of the legislative successes of the Democrats is what helped get the American economy back on track.",

         "Election finally brought me to them.\n\nSorry, but honestly, fuck all my fellow Americans. I gotta look out for me and mine since apparently we don't wanna look after each other. \n\nMy faith in my fellow American to do the right thing and not live down to the worst of us is gone. \n\nSo very disappointing.",
         "The dems lost a battle they didn\u2019t help fight. Why the fuck do people expect Florida to not get redder when we have been abandoned.",
         "The split between the overwhelming D victory for NC governor with a trump NC victory makes me think that a significant portion of these confusing outcomes is an artifact of our two party system. Based upon the results of NC with some quick maths, nearly 30% of people who voted split their ticket.\n\nI find it highly unlikely that the majority of that 30% would be voting for trump on vibes about social grievances, because the vibe trump gives is unmistakably \"the dems are pure evil and they want to trans your kids\". Someone who buys that vibe isn't going to vote for any democrat, let alone for their governor.\n\nThus, in a two party system, if you agree with some of the policy from party A and some of the policy of party B, splitting the ticket is the only way to get a third option.",
         "Florida is a weird state. The 60% threshold is insane and it didn't even pass at 60% for the requirement for constitutional amendments last time. They voted for this though.",
         "> *It\u2019s the stupid 60% requirement in order to pass anything in this god forsaken state.*\n\nGlobally though, **having only a 50% plus one to pass anything gave the world Brexit**, and many pundits were asking why the threshold wasn't higher.",
         "Let Poseidon take them. 5000 hurricanes a year will be cast upon that land",
         "Cuban Americans are pretty unique as a voting block. The earlier waves at least were pretty self-selecting to be wealthy and conservative.",
         "> As a Latin American I would love to actually talk to the people there, it seems insane. \n\nThe brazilians I've seen who move to Florida (or hell, most of the US) are very much on the insane side of the spectrum. That includes both the rich and the poor that go illegally.",
         "It's combination of that, uniformed people who think all Dems are Communists and also the fact that there are actually a lot of Cuban GOP candidates in Florida.",
         "Part of my family emigrated from Peru during the pre-Fujimori hyperinflation crisis. They see big-N neoliberal fiscal policy as the gospel that saved Peru and countries like Chile, Argentina, Colombia. \n\nBased on my experiences with them, I get the impression that Miami Latinos are so accustomed to rampant corruption that they see most uses for tax dollars as a major liability than a benefit. \n\nMiami Latinos are also strongly anti-illegal immigration. You have to remember any Latino in the voting block almost certainly got here legally or was born here. They look down on \u201cborder hoppers\u201d for \u201ccutting the line\u201d and assume that they are the bulk of southern border immigrants (as opposed to asylum seekers or lottery admits like themselves)\n\nI think if you hear some of the stories of how awful economic conditions were under many of these so-called socialist governments, you\u2019d understand. Even basic stuff like loans we take for granted don\u2019t exist and the ramifications are massive. for example my aunt couldn\u2019t get a mortgage or even save money to buy a home because of inflation. She\u2014any many others\u2014had to stockpile construction materials and build their home piecemeal paycheck by paycheck. \n\nLastly, can\u2019t ignore good ol Catholicism and machismo. Forget about abortion, forget about the gays, and definitely forget about trans people. These issues have been major net losers with Latinos for cultural/religious reasons. There is a progressive Latino movement but it\u2019s small and faces a lot of headwind because South American cultures are far more socially conservative than USA as a baseline. \n\nAll in all, I see Miami Latinos embracing the GOP for coherent reasons, even if I fundamentally disagree with them",

         "It\u2019s how authoritarians win, not by engaging their most psychotic elements but depoliticising the populace. Cultivating cynicism and nihilism. Frame anyone suggesting a better world is possible even on the margins as foolish and somehow having just as bad intents as the actual authoritarians the \u201dgood authoritarians are honest you see\u201d. You see it everywhere these days.",
         "> There'll be lots of politics talks tomorrow wherever you work or go to school...\n\nWhen Trump won in 2016, some asshat brought cupcakes that said \"sorry for your loss\" and said they were only for Clinton supporters. Working remote and being isolated from these asshats is a great thing and I'm tired of pretending it's bad",
         "D Josh Stein won NC governor with a near 15% margin, but Trump won with a 3% margin. That means that nearly 30% of people who voted red for the presidential voted blue for governor \n\nI'd be surprised if the majority of those voting for trump on vibes about made up cultural grievances would be voting for Stein for governor, since the entirety of the vibe trump emits is \"democrats are evil and they want to trans your kids\". If they're buying that vibe, then they aren't voting democrat.   \n  \nIt's more likely that the majority of that 30% is making a strategic decision limited by the fact that we are in a two party system, so the only way to have a third option on the laws that govern you is to split the ticket.\n\nEdit:\n\nSumming the listed candidates votes, roughly 5.5m voted for president, and roughly 5.5 million voted for governor \n\nThe difference is less than 100k voters and doesn't account for write ins\n\nSo being generous and rounding to 0.1m voters, about 2% voted for trump and trump only. That still leaves us questioning why 28% of voters went blue for governor and red for president.",

What shocks me is that people who were forced to leave their countries due to said economic conditions do so little to inform themselves about what action the government took that caused them and vote for a failed business man who promises to enact those same policies.\n\nMaybe the key difference is that we argentinians aren't really keen on the whole machismo and super religious except in the most poor provinces.",

Good luck fighting for those extra couple EC votes after stabbing the unions in the back I guess.",
         "Is that not how republicans operate? They work for complete control of all levels of government. Why is that foolish for democrats to work towards?

And with career politicians being the norm, the politicians will always work to protect their employment.\n\nThe only feasible solution to nullify these conflicts of interest is to organize a non-partisan \"voters union\" that would need a majority vote across the country, with the singular aim of voting out any incumbent regardless of political affiliation if they don't comply with the union's demands.\n\nIn this case, voting out any politician that doesn't vote for FPTP and ranked choice. Because while said changes would threaten the employment of the politicians in office, the voters union would be the far more immediate and tangible threat.\n\nBiggest hurdle is making sure that the union organizers don't try to bus policies that are seen as partisan, ruining the credibility of the union as a non partisan entity with the goal of solving governmental conflicts of interest.",

Scott\u2019s opponent again a lame duck and most people I talked too up too and including today didn\u2019t even know her name that\u2019s simply not a party trying to win. They are not unwinnable. Florida looks red because for the most part it\u2019s the only option. Don\u2019t tell me a massively diverse state that just got majority\u2019s on abortion and weed is some red waste backwater it doesn\u2019t add up.

There's also the unfortunate fact that South Korea can be easily blockaded and Korea has no natural resources to survive sanctions like the big nuclear states can. \n\nSouth Korea can probably negotiate a better nuclear reprocessing deal like what Japan has with 100% domestic recycling instead of having to ship South Korea's nuclear waste to the US, so South Korea can always have to option to quickly make bombs if war is imminent, but as far as defense goes South Korea is just too small to be independent in such a rough neighborhood. If China chooses to attack only with conventional forces, then South Korea will inevitably lose such a fight without the massive resource and supply base the US provides. \n\nAll this is to say, that even with the US crazy politics, South Korea (and Japan, Taiwan and Philippines) don't really have good options for how to deal with a giant like China next door who wants to return Asia back to being under Chinese rule, so South Korea is stuck with the US for the foreseeable future with or without nukes. \n\nThe good news is that America is also worried about China, so yes South Korea can probably get some good deals out of Trump, but probably not nukes.",

Oh and has the US, UK, France commit genocided *after* their nuclear programms were finished? It's either America pays to keep this order, or it's every country for themselves.",

When he tried to pull out troops from South Korea during his first term, all of congress blocked him and he had to back down, so Trump cannot do too much damage to US Asian allies.

This isn\u2019t a fit for 2024- and left behind a cancer of inefficiencies. Dems need to reinvent to \u201clet\u2019s do ____ good thing in an efficient low cost way- so we can get the most bang for our buck\u201d. This is in conflict with unions/local non for profits- but it\u2019s a big reason why it\u2019s so much more expensive to live in Dem states. \n\n* It hurts me deeply- but the Biden plan to lift up the bottom quadrant of wages through full employment failed. It led to inflation- which is politically toxic. Next time in a crisis - the horrible choice has to be mass unemployment and limited stimulus. \n\n* Dems screwed up by having so much of the infrastructure projects get bogged down in years of environmental review and paperwork. Now- Republicans will get credit for the work. \n\n* Dems failed to limit the flow of asylum seekers- and it was an unpopular disaster. This was made worse by Dem states and cities not having the capability to handle migrant influx without grifting/super inefficient spending. \n\n* Biden\u2019s late exit put Kamala in a tough position. \n\n* Millennial generation seemed to have the 2007 crash as their formative political moment- and blames Republicans for it. Gen Z is different, and seems much more open to Republicans. \n\n* Abortion referendums ran ahead of Dems pretty universally. Dems didn\u2019t seem to be able to tie Trump or other Republicans candidates to abortion policy. \n\n* Some of the story is just a global anti-incumbent wave\u2026. But Trump was the opponent. It goes beyond that. \n\n* The old media is dead. Trump and Musk figured out how to connect with voters through new media. Kamala didn\u2019t.\n\n* This might be me being petty/angry- but I think a lot of left-ish influencers had the best years of their life 2016-2020 when \u201cresistance\u201d money was flowing in for podcasts/donations. I think this made them less urgent to oppose Trump- which hurt on the margins.",

Race and identity based politics is divisive in the best of times, there\u2019s a reason why AA failed in deep blue CA. In fact, it\u2019s probably the single least popular policy that the Dems support.

People outside of social media by and large admire business leaders, and starting a successful business is a core part of the American Dream.

         "I may write a whole post on this later. But the good news for Democrats is that this election was *always* going to be an uphill battle, and while Kamala Harris actually proved to have surprisingly good political instincts, she personally is a pretty weak candidate. So you can plausibly expect that a better candidate in a more favorable climate would be able to win. Biden's tenure has been awful, and him running for so long, I think, meant a lot of voters came to terms with voting for Trump back in early-mid 2024 before Harris took over [I mean, look at the search results for \"did Joe Biden drop out\"...]. The barrier was gone after that. \n\n\nThe bad [well, if you're a D operative/partisan] news is that it's clear that the GOP's new economically populist, socially conservative agenda is in fact able to win large numbers of Latino and Black voters, as well as young voters. Consider this a categorical rejection of Bidenism at the polls. In addition, Harris' strategy to try to gain more conservative/moderate leaning suburbanites largely fizzled. I think we can place the blame here on first, the fact that Harris never really committed to any conservative policies, and second, that Biden's tenure obviated a lot of good-faith that suburban white voters had in Biden to \"restore normalcy\". \n\n\nBasically there's two paths forward, but imo really only one path. The first is to abandon social progressivism and max out economic populism--the Bernie Sanders path, but with more Black/Latino appeal. The problem is, this is what the GOP is *already* doing, and they're better at it. Biden and Harris have both tried this path, Biden squeaked over the edge and Harris flopped hard. I see no reason why a future left-populist candidate would see any more success. \n\n\nThe second is to see the path forward in the white suburbs [and multiracial suburbs]. These voters are *reliable*, they're very high quality in terms of showing up to the polls, but they aren't entirely comfortable with the current Democratic agenda. So mold the agenda to fit them, along with college educated voters that increasingly make up the base of the party. I'd say that the future Democratic Party should place at its three corners social liberals/left libertarians, fiscal conservatism, and liberal internationalism. A bit like a liberal version of the old GOP. Basically:\n\n1. the \"I want gay married couples to own AR-15s on their private weed farm\" vote\n\n2. the \"my god I hate inflation and tariffs\" vote\n\n3. the \"I don't trust the GOP internationally\" vote\n\n\nCorresponding with these three, Dems should realign their messaging. Slam Trump's tariffs [get people to put Trump \"I did this\" stickers on tarriffed goods]. Pummel him on inflation and deficits. Hit him for restrictions on social issues, while saying you just want people to be free to do what they want (in the privacy of their own homes--try not to associate too much with big, open public displays, it's offputting to normie voters).  Maintain a *strong* line internationally that doesn't waffle about, try to out-muscleman Trump and support defense spending *and* diplomacy--go full Scoop Jackson. \n\n\n\nThat's in addition to some of the stuff other commenters are mentioning, like focusing more on reform and administrative improvements--govern *smarter*, not *harder*. I also think Democrats should work to literally *change the language* they use to be flashier, more provocative, and antagonistic--part of Trump's appeal is that he \"tells it like it is\". It'll also help with the male vote if your talk about \"bringing America together\" is followed by \"to sit upon a throne of the skulls of our enemies\".",

Losing the Latino vote at all is unacceptable, especially after Trump's rally, and she did so poorly, Miami-Dade is now red. All the money sent in to her, and none of it mattered. And, why it is that we fail to understand time and time again that money and immigration motivate people better than any other issues, and therefore we need to do a much better job of selling our economic record? We went through it the last two elections, and we learned nothing. Last time we barely squeaked by. No alarm bells.\nNow, we had the highest of stakes, and we treated this election like a given.

Conservatives *also* purity test and very regularly throw their own politicians to the wolves - to a far, far, greater extent than dems do.

Insofar as throwing out *most* of our establishment (and utterly ineffective and out of touch) politicians, political leaders, and campaign strategists, and *in general* encouraging new blood *and absolutely everyone* who is even moderately qualified for political office to strongly consider doing so. From the *bottom* up.\n\nMaybe that's a step way too far, but /rant.\n\nAlternatively we maybe really should strongly consider trying to reform US elections (again, *locally* /  from the bottom up), and make real *attempts* to challenge and throw out the US 2-party system, and in particular the hyper-fixation on *national* level politics.\n\nBear in mind that we are in this situation *in the first place* because Trump *is* the only real (and credible) challenger to US establishment dem leadership.\n\nWhich is a massive f---ing problem given that US electoral politics tends to very reliably yo-yo between / against establishment / incumbent party leadership, and Trump is a populist wanna-be authoritarian - maybe - who has taken over one of the US's only two major parties.\n\nAnd ergo if you *do* have major beef with national-level dem leadership, you may very well end up voting *for that* for a change / rebellion against the current status quo. As we have very self evidently seen in this election. And dems - or more accurately center-left to far-left US media - tend to very regularly have their heads stuck up their own asses on a few issues, which is more or less at least *part* of how we've ended up in this particular situation / completely fucked election *(and trajectory over the past 10 years)* in the first place.\n\nIn general dems need to take a *really* hard look in the mirror, given that 1) HRC lost to trump in 2016, 2) Biden ran, and literally only won in 2020 due to a) trump, b) *generally* very strongly positive memories of biden as Obama's VP, and a desire to return to that point and style of leadership. Since then we have somehow completely 3) stopped talking about healthcare reform / public option, despite the ACA since becoming a massive (albeit very stopgap) public success, *and* how critical bloated healthcare (and in addition to that housing costs) are to US COL problems, wage gaps, *and* something that adds a massive and very (globally) inefficient burden to US businesses, and helps make US labor *even less* cost effective within certain industries.\n\nOh, and instead of *that* we had somehow apparently, in our infinite wisdom, turned the 2024 election entirely *into purely reactive issues against trump / republicans*, including abortion, 24/7 year-round coverage of the trump criminal proceedings and investigations, and so on and so forth. Oh, and initial stances on immigration + policing, that were 1) anti-trump, 2) blew up in our faces given a) the worldwide (and particularly in eg. europe) pivot away from support for liberal open-borders immigration.

Non-college-educated minority voters are now behaving like non-college-educated White voters. Those people have \\*always\\* been socially conservative, except for their opposition to racism. America has become less racist in the last 16 years (despite perhaps becoming more xenophobic), so opposition to racism no longer overrides other concerns for those non-college-educated racial minority voters.\n\nThere's no way the Democrats are going to abandon socially progressive policy, and shouldn't.

Trump is a really good campaigner and always has been. He can convince lots of people that he's on their side. He can mobilize huge numbers of people who don't normally vote. He has succeeded in growing the tent more than other Republican politicians by making huge inroads with Hispanics, union workers, the working and middle class, even urban voters in some areas.

Perhaps it's deflection coming from Russia, but Russia is willing to throw assets and bodies at it's problems. Europe (and the EU) is a unstable conglomerate of protectionist, dove states that lives under America like those toxic \"welfare queens\" tv programmes. New business is non-existent. They are outcompeted by most the world. Their armies exist largely on paper. Not one of them has the intelligence or bravery to do anything when a threat emerges.\n\nPoland and the UK are arguably the only states in Europe that stand a chance (UK for it's economy, Poland for it's \"I hate Russia\" stance\"). Every other nation in Europe will succumb to Salami tactics, foreign interference and general malaise of not being the one to cause \"aggression\" by standing up for themselves.\n\nAs much as Putin and other authoritarian leaders are morally wrong in their actions, I've come to the realisation that none of that truly matters. From the moment we hit our ancestors over the head with rocks, the Right of Conquest has been one of the main laws that govern our species. The only reason America is so powerful is that it uses it's muscle to get what it wants. It would seem that muscle is losing to brains.\n\nDemocracy was an experiment and it has failed.

         "Here are my attempted ill-thought-out thoughts.\n\nI think it is time that the left embraced a 19th century world view (my actual position is a 18th century but that is perhaps a dream too far). Progressivism is dead. The left are too much the moral police trying to reverse history. Trumpism is the spirit of its age. Trump has killed Neoliberalism. It is dead and the left should stop whining about politics that existed 40 years ago. Whatever was the post ww2 victory liberal world order, it is not anymore. What ever was the 90s political kumbaya \"lets make the world better\" circlejerk, is over.\n\nWhat we should do is uncertain. The Doomers believe that the future is certainly bad. I say it isn't.",

She evades telling the truth. She can't say what she's going to be different from Biden.\n\nVoters she her as a liar. A liar about her policy positions. A liar about Joe Biden health. And she didn't do anything to dissuade that.\n\nNow go listen to J.D. Vance on NYT The Interview or Trump on Joe Rogan. See how Vance articulates how he went from writing that Trump is America's Hitler to being his running mate. Or how Trump explains how his lack of political experience made him make a lot of political appointments that he regrets. They are being mostly truthful here, they provide sophisticated answers.\n\nThe good thing is that it has not much to do with ideology. The bad thing is that democrats seem particularly prone to this kind of stuff. For example, any politician that this year was a surrogate for Biden's health will have a hard time, IMHO.",
         "I'm afraid that most issues are noise, the big one that will always move the needle has been and always will be the economy. People finding it hard to afford the things they are used to having is a potential political disaster for whoever is in charge and it shouldn't be minimised. Inflation completely sank Biden's re-election chances even before it was obvious his brain had turned into soup. Harris has been left holding the bag to an extent as the bad vibes economically had already set in regardless of the fundamentals all looking great. We really do live in the age of vibes to an extent.\n\nThe worst thing is, the Biden admin did an objectively great job riding out the economic malaise he had to govern through, from covid and the hangover from all that spending, the rampant inflation fuelled by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the mess that I/P has descended into with the Houthis trying to grind maritime shipping to a halt in the region. Look at how anaemic and stagnant the major European economies are for an example of how much worse it could be. He and his team should genuinely be commended, their legacy will be similar to Obama's in that is that the US economy is in a good enough position to potentially weather another Trump presidency that tries its best to run it into the ground with tariffs and general instability and uncertainty both at home and abroad.\n\nTrump's whole image is that he's the money guy and he just happened to govern in the only time of decent economic growth and stability of the post '08 age. His literal name and signature was also on the stimmy cheques, if you're an economic illiterate (aka a super-majority of people, not only Americans) he's the only guy who ever threw you a bone. Biden and Harris were in charge when you suddenly couldn't afford your private taxi for your burrito anymore.\n\nAlso doesn't help that the only other issues people are moved to vote on is immigration, which is such a lightning rod for people's rage. I think that the democrats should have learned this lesson from looking at their European allies getting trounced for the past near-decade by now. Both the proles and bougie suburban types want less of it and want a big strong leader who is willing and happy to stamp the jackboot on the necks of the brown and black people if it means they don't have to see as many of them in their neighbourhoods, end of story. Appealing to people's humanity is a waste of time, they don't see these people as people for the most part.  They want the democrats to lace up and get stomping and they see the pro-immigration crowd as hopelessly naive and aloof to the issues around immigration at best, actively harming the country at their neighbourhood's expense at the behest of some other external power at worst. The Biden admin should have never lifted Trump's policies at the border as it literally did lead to a surge in crossings, even if numbers are back under control now. Such a stupid own-goal on behalf of people who were going to vote for you anyways.\n\nHowever, in this case I really think it's as simple as bad vibes due to inflation. The Democrats really need to get better PR and messaging when it comes to economic policy. They literally are the better economic managers but the average Joe is convinced they aren't. That is the biggest problem and most urgent issue. Sack all the useless professional-managerial class failchildren in the marketing and comms teams please. It is literally essential for global stability that these people shunned from decision making.",

Both of these miss the point. It's not what you say about the policies, **it's what the policies say about you**. I think Harris ran a decent enough campaign and I don't think the democrats really had anyone else that would have been much better, but Harris felt empty when she was talking about the issues, with the big exception of abortion. This is the problem most (democratic) politicians face, they are too careerist. If you look at the Dem field, it looks promising at first, except almost all of the possible 2028 candidates also face this same issue. Newsom, Shapiro especially. Buttigieg is one of the better ones.\n\nThis election is a vindication of Bernie Sander's \"political revolution\", not necessarily policy wise, but style wise. When Bernie speaks, regardless if you agree or not, you know that's really how he feels about the issues. Those are the kind of candidates a political party should elevate. You need to be seen as the \"change candidate\" and the only way to do that is to be authentic and talk about the issues you truly believe in. People don't want a candidate whose agenda is made up by consultants. You can focus group your policies and message to perfection, but it wont matter if people don't believe you when those words leave your mouth.

There have been smaller dominos, like Trump's first election, Brexit, the almost-success of the far right in France's recent elections, Russia/Ukraine, Hong Kong and the ascendancy of Xi Jinping, etc. But this feels like the one that could really kickstart a global right wing wave.\n\nThe last 70 years have known unprecedented peace, democracy, and progress, even amidst a scary cold war. It's easy to think that's too big to fail, because for most people alive today, it's all they know. But it's a mere blip in a human history dominated by authoritarianism and brutality.

We have to pitch the border wall and deportation as the 7 year old solution to immigration crisis. A good chunk of immigrants come because they're escaping cartel violence homelands, these cartels are fueled by drug money. Now directly fighting them doesn't work as it just creates a hydra effect, but out competing them could starve them out. The laws of supply and clearly show that people cocaine and ultimately are going to get it from somewhere. Wouldn't it be better if that capital instead of going to murderous criminals, went to federal government to be then used in programs like rehab centers? The cartel's have a variety of overheads that the federal government wouldn't have to worry about if we for example told the DEA to start growing coca plants(though I am horribly ignorant about if we have suitable places to grow stateside) and therefore we could be crush them without firing a single bullet.
