Many ballots were accepted and counted after the deadlines, and combined with the absentee balloting, there was concern that fraudulent ballots were being used to flip elections.\n\nThis ruling says that absentee ballots will not be accepted in Georgia past election day - which means it will be more difficult for those planning to cheat to create and submit a bunch of ballots after the election if they have lost.",

Only a few bucked the trend.\n\nSo, Trump winning wasn't just the shock that started Meltdown 1.0. It was the fact that Killary lost. Combine that with Trump's win, and the screaming started. I don't think that happens tomorrow. I do not believe that women are in love with Kamala like they were with Killary Clinton. I just get the vibe that women will vote for her because of policy reasons, not because there's some great love for Kommila. Maybe I'm wrong, but I just don't see the adoration.\n\nWhat I do expect is another \"not my President\" movement. I also firmly believe that the lamestream media will announce that the country has entered a recession 48-hours after Trump wins. The country has been in one for awhile already, but don't expect the lamestream types to put that into print. Absolutely not. Not until it's needed. Finally, even the far left privately admits that the lamestream media is no longer trustworthy. Therefore, every poll is taken with a grain on salt. On all sides.\n\nMyself?

On my own street, three of my neighbors removed their signs one by one as she continued to bumble and stumble her way through her teleprompted campaign, it's not that they aren't still voting for her, but they're damn sure not as proud of it.\n\nAt work I spent seven years in a position as the lone white person on my crew, before my promotion in September, and slowly but surely over the last two years I've watched all but two of them turn from heavily negative on Trump and become vocal supporters and voters for him.\n\nA lot of people in Virginia are sick of the rhetoric without results that the Dems have slung over our state for years and years.  Youngkin showed a lot of Virginia that the Governor's chair isn't just a free paycheck for some scumbag to do nothing in, and the events of London County still ring through the schools across the state.\n\nI will personally be surprised if we go full red, but I don't think we're going to be as blue as people seem to think.  Our polls were tainted by the fact that the Virginia native is the minority of the states population because of so many interstate migrants (New Jersey, New York, etc.). and initially many of them packed their politics with their pants, but I think finally some are waking up to what ruined their home states, and I hope they can course correct before they ruin mine.",

I saw how he ended the energy deal that Trump made, which resulted in the price of gas skyrocketing at day one, I saw how weak and fragile our nation became, I saw the rights and freedoms of Christians be trampled upon...  \n  \nand when you put up his policies with that of Kamala Harris, such as her desire to murder the unborn all the way up to birth, to mutilate young children, To oversexualize children without the consent of the parents, to let men into woman's bathrooms, and to completely upend The Judeo Christian principles that this country was founded upon...  \n  \nI will gladly vote for Trump every single day over Kamala Harris.  \nBecause, as Romans 132 says, those who approve of such things will suffer the wrath of God.  \nIt's extremely apparent that Kamala openly defends and supports the unrighteousness of sinners, and Trump, while he is no perfect person himself, and he has faults, at least he's willing to say that they are wrong, and that basic Christian principles should be upheld  \n  \nProverbs 4:27  \nDo not turn to the right or to the left; turn your foot from evil.\n\nAs a Christian myself, I highly highly recommend that you go out and vote for Donald Trump, not because he's the Republican choice, but because voting for him is turning our foot away from the evil that Kamala Harris wants to impose on every single American.",

         "Another angry reply. This one you went with a personal attack towards me having a mythical deeper problem. Even though I too am a Republican and I too am a Christian.\n\nHere is the reply you obviously so desperately need....\n\nIt isn't about Kamala or Trump for me. It's about the Lamb of God. God calls on Christian's alone to be ambassadors for God. Representatives on this earth. As there are zero Christian's running there are zero people for me to vote for. You can look at corrinthians for that little Token of knowledge.\n\nTrump is ok with abortion, an adulterer (this is not because of him being a sexual offender but instead due to him being divorced), doesn't believe in Christ being King, and defiled the book of God by putting man's laws in it. \n\nKamala is also straight disgusting for her own reasons I don't need to go down to.\n\nSome people say that voting for Trump is voting for the lesser of two evils. News flash, you don't have to vote for anything evil. You can stay home. I'm not trying to be on the \"right side of history\" on earth. I'm aiming to be on the right side of the Lord our God. And I will absolutely not be voting for anyone in this election. I will be staying home. And there is absolutely nothing you or anyone else can do to change that for myself and millions of other objective Christian's in this nation that have chosen to stay home.",
         "So in other words, you're willing to potentially damn our entire nation because the objectively better candidate isn't a saint?\n\nI assume this means you never vote then, right?\n\nI really don't understand this logic. Option A is massively flawed but tries to do right by the nation. Option B is evil and stands for the opposite of everything in your faith. So your decision is to role the dice on evil and do nothing?"

It was common sense, it was the country in dire need of strong leadership, it was the idea of how we as a country can longer stand the divide.

It\u2019s 60% short of where they were in 2020 and 20% off what they stated was their must hit minimum. \n\nUsually you can\u2019t put much weight on polls, but right now polls, betting odds, early vote indicators and party registration all show Trump up a healthy amount. \n\nUsually when you have a single candidate indicator sweep it\u2019s extremely difficult to overcome. So I predict PA isn\u2019t really in to much danger. \n\nThe same is going on with Nevada btw, I seriously doubt Nevada doesn\u2019t turn red this election. However Wisconsin is mixed indicator so it\u2019s more likely to stay blue than Nevada is to stay blue. \n\nIt\u2019s also important to remember Trump is up in the polling but that\u2019s not the full story. On average every election Trump has participated in the polling was skewed against him on average 4.5 points in PA (higher in MI and WI). \n\nIn theory they should try to correct against this and be more accurate, but 2020 they should have done the same but they were farther off than in 2016. So we could very possibly see a 3-5 point lead come out of there.",

I used to love that show, but the blatant attacks on Trump after he took office forced me to find another form of entertainment. Half the country felt the same way. Why do you think SNL gets three hours of PRIMETIME on Saturday night these days? Because NBC is begging for an audience. Any audience. Please.\n\n2. I am of the belief that Lorne Michaels lost all creative control over his show in 2017. SNL became bitter and meanspirited. That was never Lorne's thing. Lorne may be a Democrat, but he never hated Republicans. The hate and vitriol that flowed from SNL during the Trump years never, ever took place under the Reagan, Bush 1 and Bush 2 administrations. Lorne believed in making people laugh, not making them hate one another.\n\n3. DEI mandates destroyed that show. Absolutely destroyed it. I don't know if creators like Lorne Michaels will ever get a chance at full control ever again. Can you imagine what would have happened if NBC pulled this crap on Rod Serling?",

I am a 20F .I am someone who is very shy and doesn\u2019t have many friends at all . \nI am a former democrat and now I am a trump supporter becauze I realized how much propaganda and lies were being told about him. I also see how more people thrived during his presidency. Myself included \n\nI  felt called to speak out on my instagram story. I have seen so much lies and propaganda and I just needed to expose it . I made a couple posts about how the economy and stuff was better under trump and I have made many posts exposing  Kamala and her lies and her fraudulent behavior , stupid policies etc . Many stuff I\u2019ve found on here , memes and what not \n\nHowever , I feel kinda hated for it . I already have low self esteem and struggle to make friends and everyone my age is like a brainwashed democrat who thinks black and white . I\u2019ve had people swipe up on my story  and call me disgusting . I\u2019ve lost many aquritances , potential friends , followers , destroyed relationships with family members and more.\nI truely believe in what I\u2019ve been posting and I belive I am doing the right thing but I know how brainwashed and black and white these folks are and I feel like I\u2019ve made my loneliness situation a lot worse now no one wants to be my friend now that I\u2019ve made these posts . \ndoes anyone have advice on how to be confident in your support for trump ? \nEven when so many people just see you as terrible for it .
