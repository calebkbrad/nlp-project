For example, there was a mother who was clean for 20 plus years and unfortunately her daughter who rarely used drugs overdosed on a fake Xanax (laced with fentanyl). Her daughter was only 17 when she died. That poor lady wanted to end her life by taking a hot shot and it took her everything in her power to not do that. I\u2019m sorry if you relapse because of a political election then you probably didn\u2019t want to get clean in the first place, that or you just want attention.

Then they attacked me bringing up other things unrelated to my post. \n\nIf you believe Project 2025 is what is going to happen (as if all that could happen) then maybe sort of feel like it would be downhill/backwards. But I don't believe it is his platform or that even half of it can be done. Even with having the house and senate, they are unlikely to address all the things in that project especially as it relates to women in 2 years. There are other more important things to address. (2 years being when voting happens again and we could lose the senate or something.) Even if we get all 4, they just aren't going to do everything in that project. \n\nI have not read the project but was able to gather info about it regarding women. \n\nOne BIG concern they have is not being able to get the abortion pills. \n\nPersonally I'm ok with a morning after, but after several weeks it is too hard on a woman's body. They don't want women to know that it isn't like birth control. It's a medical miscarriage and there might be baby parts the further along. How gruesome to see you killed your baby.

Standing up for women is voting for Trump! \n\nAlso, I feel like abortion isn\u2019t even a real issue for dems because what\u2019s the point of forcing kids to be the opposite gender and injecting fake history and news in their brains if they just wanted to abort them all anyway?? It\u2019s so hypocritical. Biden could\u2019ve done something related to abortion, and he didn\u2019t.

Idk and idc, because he didn't get rich as a public servant from being slimy. That's when I started paying very close attention to politics and haven't looked back. I'm praying after Trump we have Vance in 28 & 32. They aren't the same breed of politicians from before. When you see all the other living ex-President's standing in support of Harris regardless of party affiliation, that's all you need to see to get that they truly were all the same.

As a younger guy, I honestly feel she gave me no reason to vote for her, this is in addition to wanting to continue to support wars. I wouldn't go die for this lady or her administration if it came down to it. \n* She became a main candidate without anyone wanting her after Biden dropped out and failed to distinguish herself from him.\n* Kamala suggested taxing capital gains which is a horrible idea, considering investors are the ones who not only stir the economy but also help create jobs.",

Leave them alone. If they still want to transition when they are an adult, that is their choice and power to them.\n\nHowever, I have also seen de-transitioners talk of their experiences and how they were forced into it.

Require every citizen show that ID every time they vote, every time they apply for a government benefit, every time they apply for a job, every time they're stopped by the police, every time they interact with any level of American government or do anything else where proof of citizenship is required or beneficial.

         "Donald Trump might pull this off. It\u2019s too early to say; we might not know till the middle of next year, or whenever some\u00a0[antediluvian state finishes counting by hand](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/05/us-presidential-election-2024-when-dates-candidates-voting/). Plus Electoral College madness means that Trump could surge in the popular vote yet still lose via Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan (the reverse Hillary). But consider the following:\n\nFirst, he took\u00a0[Florida easily, including Miami-Dade](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/05/us-election-latest-news-polling-trump-kamala/). Joe Biden won that county in 2020; Hillary Clinton swept it by nearly 30 points in 2016. What\u2019s made the difference? Trump\u2019s doing well among Latino voters, presumably men.\n\nSecond, there are hints he\u2019s gained ground among the affluent in Virginia, which is supposed to be a lock for Kamala; Wasps with degrees are her people.\n\nThird, he seems to be scooping Georgia, which might have been competitive and certainly suggests the sun-belt is safe (Texas is also not in play). Fourth, an NBC exit poll gives him a six point advantage among independents in the critical state of Pennsylvania.\n\nExit polls generally indicate that\u00a0[\u201cthe future of democracy\u201d is a leading issue,](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/comment/2024/11/06/americans-voting-out-of-resentment-and-fear/)\u00a0which breathless TV commentators assumed was a good sign for Harris. But lots of Republicans think the Democrats stole the election in 2020, so they might be recording concern for that issue as well.\n\nThe other major matter is the economy, and Trump polls stronger than Kamala on that one for obvious reasons (ie inflation). No wonder election betting seems to slightly favour Republicans, along with the\u00a0*New York Times*\u00a0and Decision Desk HQ.\n\nBut, yes, there\u2019s a long night ahead, and none of us knows anything for sure. It\u2019s a delight to watch British TV presenters disclose the latest thing they read on CNN as if it were a personal insight (\u201dI\u2019m predicting now that Harris will take Vermont and the Pope will carry the Vatican\u201d).\n\nBut what we can decisively say at this juncture is that of the four options \u2013 Trump easy win, narrow win; Harris narrow win, easy win \u2013 the Harris easy win is off the table. Despite January 6, a rape trial, \u201ceating the pets\u201d and a comedian calling Puerto Rico a \u201cfloating island of garbage\u201d. I wonder if Joe Biden might have done better?\n\n**Read more from The Telegraph:** [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/comment/2024/11/06/its-beginning-to-look-like-donald-trump-is-going-to-win/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/comment/2024/11/06/its-beginning-to-look-like-donald-trump-is-going-to-win/)",
