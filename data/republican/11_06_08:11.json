         "thats so accurate, ive never seen hate from the right like i do from the left, the main issue i have with a lot of left wing voters is them blindly believing the information that is said by the left without even considering checking the right, that said if someone has fully informed themselves then i have nothing to say",
         "Serious question though. Do you honestly believe that schools are taking small children and performing operations on them? Like is that truly what you think is happening?",
         "Wtf? No. But a lot of places like to put sexual books in their schools that talk about how if you feel like a boy when you're a girl, you're a boy. Kids grow up believing that. Hell, I thought I was a boy for the longest time as a kid, and then I found out I was a girl.\n\nIt is not okay to feed this type of stuff to underage kids. It has no business in schools. I've watched so many videos of parents and even kids reading pure smut that is available in their libraries to their school boards. They are straight up indoctrinating them. Kids are kids. Leave them alone. If they still want to transition when they are an adult, that is their choice and power to them.\n\nHowever, I have also seen de-transitioners talk of their experiences and how they were forced into it. It is disgusting. It is not the schools performing operations. Doctors can be easily bought for the right price.\n\nI am not anti-trans. I just want people to go about it the right way. Leave the kids out of it.",
         "Then your statement above is merely inflammatory and false. We can disagree about how things are and how we want them to be or wish they were - but when there\u2019s political forces pushing false narratives, what you say does matter.",
         "I've known 4 people who transitioned, with each of them they were doing it to escape childhood drama.  \"Gender affirming care\" should include alot of therapy because nothing says instant regret like a M2F transition when they get hit hard with the realization of what it means to be a man."

It\u2019s too early to say; we might not know till the middle of next year, or whenever some\u00a0[antediluvian state finishes counting by hand](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/05/us-presidential-election-2024-when-dates-candidates-voting/). Plus Electoral College madness means that Trump could surge in the popular vote yet still lose via Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan (the reverse Hillary). But consider the following:\n\nFirst, he took\u00a0[Florida easily, including Miami-Dade](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/05/us-election-latest-news-polling-trump-kamala/). Joe Biden won that county in 2020; Hillary Clinton swept it by nearly 30 points in 2016. What\u2019s made the difference? Trump\u2019s doing well among Latino voters, presumably men.\n\nSecond, there are hints he\u2019s gained ground among the affluent in Virginia, which is supposed to be a lock for Kamala; Wasps with degrees are her people.\n\nThird, he seems to be scooping Georgia, which might have been competitive and certainly suggests the sun-belt is safe (Texas is also not in play). Fourth, an NBC exit poll gives him a six point advantage among independents in the critical state of Pennsylvania.\n\nExit polls generally indicate that\u00a0[\u201cthe future of democracy\u201d is a leading issue,](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/comment/2024/11/06/americans-voting-out-of-resentment-and-fear/)\u00a0which breathless TV commentators assumed was a good sign for Harris. But lots of Republicans think the Democrats stole the election in 2020, so they might be recording concern for that issue as well.\n\nThe other major matter is the economy, and Trump polls stronger than Kamala on that one for obvious reasons (ie inflation). No wonder election betting seems to slightly favour Republicans, along with the\u00a0*New York Times*\u00a0and Decision Desk HQ.\n\nBut, yes, there\u2019s a long night ahead, and none of us knows anything for sure. It\u2019s a delight to watch British TV presenters disclose the latest thing they read on CNN as if it were a personal insight (\u201dI\u2019m predicting now that Harris will take Vermont and the Pope will carry the Vatican\u201d).\n\nBut what we can decisively say at this juncture is that of the four options \u2013 Trump easy win, narrow win; Harris narrow win, easy win \u2013 the Harris easy win is off the table. Despite January 6, a rape trial, \u201ceating the pets\u201d and a comedian calling Puerto Rico a \u201cfloating island of garbage\u201d. I wonder if Joe Biden might have done better?\n\n**Read more from The Telegraph:** [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/comment/2024/11/06/its-beginning-to-look-like-donald-trump-is-going-to-win/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/comment/2024/11/06/its-beginning-to-look-like-donald-trump-is-going-to-win/)",

That means the presumption of innocence applies, so there were no underlying crimes, which means the misdemeanors couldn't be elevated to felonies.

He does not endorse Pr0ject 2025. He did not ban transitioning for consenting adults. He did not not ban gay people from adopting.
