         "They say the vote came in way too fast. Well people seem to forget or maybe they were to young and didn't pay attention yet but before the bs of the last 8 years, we knew who the president was by 10pm election night, not days and weeks. This actually felt like a pretty normal election night.",
         "There\u2019s a chart that shows 2020 had almost double the amount of Democratic Party votes, whereas 2012, 2016, and 2024 were all almost the exact same amount. That\u2019s the only election abnormality that\u2019s real",
         "\"im no conspiracy theorist\" tf u are now",
         "I mean do they even know they are digging themselves a grave....to her point...exactly,  where DID 15 MILLION VOTES GO!!",
         "The likely cheating of 2020 aside, a didn\u2019t a bunch of states also purge some of their voter registries, enforce stricter voter ID laws, and tighten up the observance of the count?",
         "Or those 81 million votes never existed, it\u2019s either Trump was right about Electoral Fraud in 2020 or Harris was such a shit candidate that not even her own party members showed up.",
         "It\u2019s more likely they cheated in 2020 and pumped the ballots!",
         "Impossible. I've been assured by the left that our system is too secure for there to be fraud to the point that we wouldn't even have to bother looking into it.\n\nBut I suppose we should do our due diligence. \nThere's a discrepancy between the number of democrat ballots this election vs last election? We should dig into both of these to see where that could've come from.",
         "Looks like there are some \u201cElection Deniers\u201d out there. Which, according to the talking heads from 4 years ago, is worse than being a Nazi.",
         "The fact they can\u2019t make the connection is really stunning cognitive dissonance.",
         "The more you look at this the more it\u2019s obvious they rigged 2020 to keep him out",
         "Well too late! She already conceded!",
         "The fact that someone actually thinks the president can just simply declare an election invalid is mind-blowing.  But we\u2019re the uneducated wanna be dictators?",
         "Do they not realise they are just denying the 2020 result?",
         "Oh how the turns tabled \ud83e\udd23",
         "Hahahahaha but when Trump challenged the results it was different??? Sit down\u2026",
         "It\u2019s crazy lol. You don\u2019t get to just \u201cdemand a recount\u201d because they called states before 70% hahahaha, you have to be within .5% to call a recount. \n\nYou don\u2019t get a recount because you are having a tizzy fit your candidate lost in an absolute landslide",
         "I am all in favor of them wanting an investigation. Lets do this and find out what the fuck happened in 2020. \n\nWe should be applauding this. Lets fix our fucking elections. Florida had there votes counted in a hour. There should be no excuses. Voter id's lets do this investigation.",
         "Election deniers.",

         "All those mail in ballots in 2020 and who knows what other shady stuff went down.",
         "Funny how we were crazy four years ago, but they did this shit in 2016 and again now\u2026",
         "As I've said and will say, let them cry, and let's feed into it so they demand voter integrity laws and universal voter ID to \"prevent this in the future.\"\n\nPotentially demand a census update too, they miscounted in 2020, so why not.",
         "Sure. Recount California. A state you won. That makes sense.",
         "Funny how they pointed out that Utah was 0% counted when they called it for Trump... If they were actually paying attention, the same thing was done with California, Oregon, and Washington, as well as much of the North east (although, when fox called Oregon, Associated Press still hadn't called it).\n\nAlso claiming that (all) states were only at 50% when they were called is false. They don't understand projecting the count. They also didn't pay attention because Georgia, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania weren't called until they were 90%+ counted.\n\nMaybe I'm the outlier. I like data, and was all over it on election night.",
         "The reason is because the cheated in 2020 during Covid with mail in ballots. People voting multiple times, dead people voting and they new republicans would pay closer attention this election and there is no pandemic so it made cheating to hard. To me it\u2019s only proof that 2020 was stolen",
         "Oh cool, we\u2019re gonna do the Russia thing again\u2026 also it seems like voting in person, on Election Day, with ID checks would solve a lot of the problems.",

         "Throwing a tantrum because they didn't get what they wanted. IT MUST BE FRAUD! No, the people spoke and this is the result. You know, like a democracy.",

         "Let he who is without sin cast the first stone.",
         "I'm sure the Dems who ran the 2020 election are telling all these people to stfu. They are drawing attention to a glaring issue. How did Joe Biden get 15m more votes than Obama.",
         "Just imagine a pride style demonstration like January 6th. The people showing up would be epic to watch",
         "I just want to say let them go down this track., Sure they are refusing to look at the past 20 years and not seeing the outlier itself was 2020, not this year, but let them cook.\n\nMaybe, just maybe, they can convince themselves we need better election integrity.",
         "This is how election night is supposed to go. You are supposed to know results that night or very close to that night. Thr left ruins everything. It's like in education right now there are so many teachers and schools who have a really loose late policy because of a convoluted philosophy about fairness. All it has done is obscure the data and make it more difficult to run classes in an efficient, timely, and reasonable manner and you end up unable to rely on the institution.\n\nThis is what they have done to education, to voting, to law in general, to abortion standards, immigration, to virtually every aspect of life, they have eliminate strict standards and it has made a mess of everything which then leaves plenty of room in their minds for conspiracy theories when convenient to them and an easy denial of actual conspiracies because everything is so loose and hard to track.\n\nAnd then when you want to assert some standards and order after the mess they made of it, they are like \"YuO kNoW WhO elSe LiKEd oRdER??? HITLER!!!\"",
         "These are people who honestly didn\u2019t believe the last election was as rigged.. now they\u2019re starting to see, something is REALLY off about the 2020 Biden votes.",
         "Ahh they were so close to figuring it out but ended up going down the wrong path. Shame",
         "That is because in 2020, a big part of the \u201c18 million voters\u201d did not exist.lol but hey, what the hell. Let\u2019s just smile and wave, smile and wave \ud83d\udc4b\ud83c\udffc",

         "Karma. Ain't dat about a bitch.",
         "It\u2019s quite entertaining to watch them at home, oblivious to the fact that the votes cast in 2020 exceeded the number of registered voters. Now, they seem to believe that most of the newly registered voters all lean towards the Democratic Party. \nWhat I took away from this election is that a significant number of moderate Democrats have chosen to register as independents. Many of them opted not to vote at all, as they found it difficult to support Trump outright. It was simpler for them to stay silent about their preferences rather than cast a vote for someone they didn\u2019t truly believe in. They certainly weren\u2019t excited about voting for a candidate they didn\u2019t connect with.\n\n\u201cWe are about to enter a period of fascism and authoritarianism\u201d\n\nWait doesn\u2019t she realize the communists lost?",
         "No chance in hell Biden looks into this, he'll just expose himself on how he cheated.",

         "Sounds like insurrection",
         "Oooo the hypocrisy is ripe.",
         "but when we said this in 2020 they told us to stfu and accept he lost. hypocrites",
         "Probably all the fake votes and they still don't have 2 states finished at least when I just checked they weren't and they're still holding red.\n\nPlus they always claim this If a republican wins.",
         "They are so close! Poor little things can't connect the dots though. If they weren't so brainwashed, I'd help the ignorant little buggers figure out that the 2020 election was the one that was actually stolen.",
         "And this is now the time where the Democrats turn and now claim there was a stolen election\u2026 it\u2019s a bold strategy cotton, let\u2019s see how this one plays out",

         "They had polls going for months about how they had the most undecided voters in history. Many democrats were sited not voting in this election as they did not want to vote for Trump nor could vote for Bidenomics again. This isn\u2019t surprising",

         "If they look at the election before Biden (Hillary) or before that (Obama) or before that (Obama) they\u2019ll find the same number of voters as Kamala got. The only one that ever had those 20 million was Biden. They didn\u2019t exist with him so how could they vote for Kamala. We just did a better job making sure they couldn\u2019t cheat. Congrats Trump on your third presidential election win.",
         "They\u2019re so close to figuring it out\u2026 so so soooooo close\u2026",
         "These people are lemmings.. just because a state was \u201ccalled\u201d doesn\u2019t mean they didn\u2019t count their ballots and then properly notify the electorate candidate afterward\u2026 here in the west coast, at 8:01pm, literally the minute after our polls closed, CA, OR, and WA we\u2019re \u201ccalled\u201d for Kamala\u2026 don\u2019t see those states being used in their example. \n\nThey need to realize, the AP or any news outlet \u201ccalling\u201d a state has NO impact on anything legally. Their campaigns have access to the SAME DATA the news outlets do, so they can agree or disagree with any \u201ccall\u201d the media makes. \n\nHence, when Kamala conceded, it\u2019s not based on \u201cFox Called the state- demand a recount\u201d data\u2026 it\u2019s based on her staff agreeing with \u201cthe call\u201d after analyzing data and seeing what counties still need to report, what\u2019s outstanding, what the ratios are, etc.\n\nI get it- mAtH iS hArD and 2+2 doesn\u2019t equal 4 if your candidate doesn\u2019t win\u2026",

         "I mean, it didn\u2019t make sense to contest the election in 2020 and it doesn\u2019t make sense to do it now. I get that statistics of it can shock people but there has to be a real basis for the skepticism, though. I think people are just upset but that\u2019s never an excuse. We can criticize Dems for doing this now but the criticism has to be equally applied on both ends so that the practice doesn\u2019t continue moving forward. I think questioning anything is fine but to out rightly make false claims is aggravating an already tense situation, lol.",

Funny though, they think this time its off cause so many less votes than 2020. They are so close, yet don't see the irony biting their noses. They are correct that the numbers don't add up, but they refuse to accept the real reason why, that the 2020 election was fucked.",

         "They\u2019re so close but still so far. The vote count doesn\u2019t make sense because it was fake in 2020. Dems shot themselves in the foot using point Biden numbers to project Kamala\u2019s performance",

Counties count ballots and typically report county totals all at once. Some do it periodically. It's why there's always an influx of democratic ballots at the end because, turns out, there's more people in most democratic counties than Republican counties, and it takes longer to count. It's not conspiracy, it's math and logistics.",

In his moment of reflection he asks himself \u201ccould it be that I\u2019m so out of touch, I\u2019m wrong on this issue?\u201d Then within a few seconds of contemplation, he says \u201cno\u2026it\u2019s the children who are wrong.\u201d \n\nThis is a perfect representation of the establishment; or as I prefer to call them, the empire.

Well the empire showed its cards when Trump came down the escalator. They went from suggesting we might be wrong to full on calling us nazi, fascist, racist, (insert root word of your choice)-phobic. They\u2019ve screamed at us and used inflammatory rhetoric while demanding our compliance and allegiance. \n\nWe finally were backed into a corner and we pushed back. We the people voted overwhelmingly for a real estate billionaire from NY who drug the Republican Party along with him. Once elected, the empire resisted him at every turn. He alone couldn\u2019t accomplish a lot because he faced so much resistance. Four years later, he was defeated in favor of a perfect tool of the empire (Biden.) Biden has been an empire tool for five decades. He is the epitome of politician in that he stands for nothing and simply licks his finger and holds it to the wind to determine his platform. An obvious choice to the bidding of the empire. *Allow me to sit at the big desk and I\u2019ll do whatever you like.* As Biden adopted the platform of the far left that distract us (trans, abortion, etc.) but in reality, adopted the platform of the empire (endless war, empire building, propaganda, etc.) Four years of telling us that it\u2019s good that men can expose themselves in women\u2019s locker rooms after beating those women in their sports, sexualizing our children, displaying their sexual proclivities in public, etc., we were once again backed into a corner. Again, we pushed back. \n\nWe the people overwhelmingly voted for the New York billionaire. But the New York billionaire is smart. He went away four years ago and regrouped. He returned with former democrats who have power, wealth, and influence. Elon, Tulsi, RFK, Rogan, Weinstein, Taibi, Pool, Greenwald, on and on.

We showed the insane leftists that we don\u2019t want to subscribe to their religion. We love women. We love children. We want to protect them and watch them thrive. \n\nIn this defeat, the left went full principal Seymour Skinner. ***If*** they actually had a moment where they contemplated the possibility that they were out of touch, they very quickly doubled down and said \u201cno\u2026it\u2019s the children who are wrong.\u201d",

Abortion and trans rights over women\u2019s rights is an a front to the nuclear family.\n\nMost I know would support common sense abortion laws, the issue with trans rights is, what they are really saying is someone else has the right to dissolve your nuclear family if they so choose to change your child or they have the right to force your daughter to compete unfairly against a biological male, or their safe spaces are invaded, etc",

The same slimy career politicians who got rich from being in an elected position was on either side. Then came Trump. Did he become rich by also being slimy? Idk and idc, because he didn't get rich as a public servant from being slimy. That's when I started paying very close attention to politics and haven't looked back. I'm praying after Trump we have Vance in 28 & 32. They aren't the same breed of politicians from before. When you see all the other living ex-President's standing in support of Harris regardless of party affiliation, that's all you need to see to get that they truly were all the same. Today's Republican party has become the party of the blue collar men and women, party of law and order, party of true conservative small town values. They have a fantastic opportunity and excellent momentum right now, and I hope they don't waste a moment of it.",

Why did even RBG want to overturn Roe and why is it good that it's a decision at the level of the states instead of the individual? \n\nI agree with the majority of the right in abortion stance. However I do know that 2 responsible adults can genuinely have an accident occur, and not know until ~5-6 week period which many states is the limit. I do recall even Trump himself saying he thinks that's too soon.",
         "Even RBG said that *Roe* needed to be overturned and she further said that if it came to the Court, she would vote to overturn. She died before that happened, but even as blue as she is, she understood that *Roe* was a bad ruling, as it legislates and that is not the job of the Court. Giving power back to the states to decide is the correct decision.",
         "Why? Why can't it just be a choice up to the person in the entire country and then on top of that. States are putting it into law that to try and move to another state to get an abortion is a criminal offense. Personally I feel it should be a choice a woman should be able to make it shouldn't involve the state at all.",

That means it can't do anything unless there's legislation stating it can do those things. States have police rights. That means they can do whatever unless there's a law stating they can not do those things. \n\nThe state jurisdiction is anything that happens within their borders. For example, Hawaii has no authority over anything that happens in Florida and vice versa. \n\nFederal jurisdiction is not encompassing. However its mandate restricts its interference in state matters. The federal government is to provide national security and government interstate matters. \n\nThis is why a state has the authority and Supreme Court backing to enforce vaccine mandates but the federal government does not.\n\nEdit: I'm only addressing the issue of who has the authority over the matter, not the morality of it.",

I didn\u2019t become the least bit political until the last couple of years of Trumps first term. I knew politicians only served their own interests and appreciated that a non political candidate was chosen. I thought we were screwed either way. When the MSM came after him so hard my eyes were opened to the Deep State agenda to fight him tooth and nail and prevent people from appreciating his fight for freedom. He is none of the horrible things so many think about him. He wants what is best for the average American citizen and isn\u2019t worried about lining his own pockets or those of his friends. \n\nAs Reddit is a very left-leaning platform it is not the best environment to really research all the positive things surrounding Trump and republican views.

They just can\u2019t fathom the reality that Kamala was probably the worst candidate in the history of the country and that Trump was up in literally every demographic of people in this country, so naturally they revert back to their \u201ceveryone is racist and sexist\u201d bullshit. \n\nWhen you actually consider it, them asserting that Trump won because of racists and sexists actually _is itself_ a racist thing to say. It\u2019s just like Biden saying the \u201cif you vote for Trump, you ain\u2019t black\u201d thing. \n\nThey can\u2019t believe that minority demographics voted for Trump in record numbers. Surely all black people and Hispanics are a pure monolith and will always vote for a \u201cblack\u201d/minority democrat, right? They all think the same exact way because of the color of their skin, right? It\u2019s just another classic case of the left\u2019s own racism that they lack the ability to recognize, right up there with \u201cblack people/minorities are incapable of acquiring a photo ID\u201d and the whole \u201cwhite savior\u201d concept, for example. It\u2019s not the first time they\u2019ve acted this way, and it certainly won\u2019t be the last.",
         "I mean racism and whatnot exist regardless. It\u2019s probably just been exacerbated due to the Dem candidate. Nevertheless, I think the dems just didn\u2019t show up for Harris and the campaign was a failure. The only ones they should be angry at is their own party. Just like Republicans had to do, they must learn from their mistakes. This is politics.",
         "(Btw, I\u2019m not trying to stir anything up or pick a fight with you here or anything like that either, I\u2019m just having a conversation with you)\n\nI mean, I\u2019m not concerned or stressed about it either (if anything, I find it highly entertaining lol), but based on how they have handled literally every other situation like this where a Republican wins in anything, assuming that they\u2019re going to die down or stop talking about this election this time is like the exact opposite of what they\u2019re going to do. Like, they literally spent four years denying the 2016 election results and made up all sorts of nonsense to try to discredit the outcome.\n\nThat sort of behavior is absolutely going to be a staple of the left for the next four years; it\u2019s going to be all that they talk about for a good while. Just turn the channel over to cnn or msnbc for a minute and see how insanely they are currently reacting to this. \n\nFor example, Morning Joe went on a rant yesterday morning that was literally nothing but 100% lies. He included the \u201cvery fine people\u201d hoax, \u201cTrump wants to have Liz Cheney executed\u201d bs, the \u201cliteral dictator\u201d nonsense\u2014basically every single lie you\u2019ve ever heard from the left, including the ones that have been completely and entirely debunked. I\u2019m literally not exaggerating here; every single thing he said was a blatant lie in every way. Their audience actually believes that shit when he says it, so thinking that those people are going to just give up when they\u2019ve been fed that propaganda and built up these massive non-existent stakes for nearly a decade doesn\u2019t seem likely to me. \n\nWe know their playbook, and nowhere in that playbook does it say to just accept Trump and shut up about it. A massive swath of them literally think he is going to create a fascist dictatorship in this country, and they 100% believe that. Again, I\u2019m not exaggerating anything here.\n\nThe left has not changed since 2016, so I have no reason to believe that they\u2019re just gonna drop this election talk all of a sudden. On the contrary, I have every reason to believe that they _will_ keep harping on it and making up lies to cope. It\u2019s not going to just vanish anytime soon. \n\nSo yeah, I\u2019m not stressing about it either, but thinking that they\u2019re gonna quit or die down with the crazy ass rhetoric is assuming they have any semblance of intellectual integrity, which they absolutely don\u2019t. It does make for some incredibly entertaining freak out moments, though lol.",

I\u2019m not trying to poke the bear, but I\u2019ve always held the position that it\u2019s really hard to criticize one party for doing something that both of them do, which is talk. Republicans talk about Trump, Dems talk about Trump, everyone talks about Trump. Both sides pass lies around like Thanksgiving dinner. It\u2019s the nature of politics. That is particularly why I do not see them talking as something to harp on. \n\nI actually have seen lots of journalists talk about the failure of the Dem party, though. You and I may have been looking at different sections of media but I haven\u2019t seen anyone deny the results of any sort. Some blame-shifting for sure, but you know there will always be people who lie in media. You should always control for that when watching anything, anyway. That\u2019s kind of something we can\u2019t do much about.\n\nTrump is a provocative figure, let\u2019s be honest. At least the sensible individuals here can admit to that. Like him all you want, but he isn\u2019t popular just because of his politics. He aggravates the atmosphere that politicians have maintained for decades. He\u2019s a charismatic leader who has a loyal following which encourages him to remain steadfast. To expect anyone to stop talking about him is, at the very least, unrealistic. Now, will we have another Jan 6th? No, because that\u2019s nonsense. Like I said, the most Dems can do is talk about it all day, which they\u2019re at liberty to do. Just like Republicans are at liberty to call Joe Biden old and Kamala Harris a \u201cwitch.\u201d Also understand that they\u2019re in shock at how massively the Dem party failed, even more so than they did in 2016. This is feeling more like the 5 stages of grief. I get that you\u2019re annoyed by it, but Republicans went through it in 2020. This is nothing new. The only difference is Dems will take up space on social media for the next four years until they get a chance at office again, but it\u2019s highly unlikely any physical opposition will take place. This is a red wave election. Trump has more power than he did in 2016. So the most Dems CAN do is talk, lol.",

As a younger guy, I honestly feel she gave me no reason to vote for her, this is in addition to wanting to continue to support wars. I wouldn't go die for this lady or her administration if it came down to it. \n* She became a main candidate without anyone wanting her after Biden dropped out and failed to distinguish herself from him.\n* Kamala suggested taxing capital gains which is a horrible idea, considering investors are the ones who not only stir the economy but also help create jobs.",
