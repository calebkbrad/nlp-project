I only personally know 2 people voting for her- which says something because I have a large, diverse family & friend group. I work with mostly all females, and the only male in the group is voting for Harris. \n\nKeep in mind that the demographic most likely to answer polls- are liberal women. Not very representative of the entire nation. Older folks and men aren\u2019t really going to be answering polls, they want to be left alone OR simply are not able to access internet (or don\u2019t want to) due to age- yes, even in this day and age- there\u2019s still a lot of older folk who don\u2019t have internet or cell phones. Obviously that\u2019s not everyone, but still a large group of people we forget about.\n\nHarris has had her campaign blown up on social media & has paid lots of high profile celebrities to speak at her rallys/endorse her as president. I mean, what, Beyonc\u00e9 was paid $10 mil to speak at her rally. These things really give the illusion that she\u2019s more favorable than she is, which is the goal of her campaign. Talk less, smile more, make others do the talking. I just cannot see how someone so\u2026 well, unqualified could make it this far. Am I saying she\u2019s not qualified experience wise? No not necessarily, I mean, we\u2019re voting for trump, who hadnt been involved in politics much at all until elected. BUT it\u2019s her intelligence and communication skills that are SEVERELY lacking in this aspect. It\u2019s embarrassing to watch. I can\u2019t imagine her speaking to any other important leaders of other nations, or giving presidential addresses, etc. it\u2019s the feeling you get when you see the really drunk girl at the bar trying to dance on the table.

Neighborhoods that flew Kerry, Kaine, and Obama signs proudly are not flying the Kamala flag, and when you see the local Democrats placing their signs out, it's in front of unsold houses, undeveloped lots, and public land.  On my own street, three of my neighbors removed their signs one by one as she continued to bumble and stumble her way through her teleprompted campaign, it's not that they aren't still voting for her, but they're damn sure not as proud of it.\n\nAt work I spent seven years in a position as the lone white person on my crew, before my promotion in September, and slowly but surely over the last two years I've watched all but two of them turn from heavily negative on Trump and become vocal supporters and voters for him.\n\nA lot of people in Virginia are sick of the rhetoric without results that the Dems have slung over our state for years and years.  Youngkin showed a lot of Virginia that the Governor's chair isn't just a free paycheck for some scumbag to do nothing in, and the events of London County still ring through the schools across the state.\n\nI will personally be surprised if we go full red, but I don't think we're going to be as blue as people seem to think.  Our polls were tainted by the fact that the Virginia native is the minority of the states population because of so many interstate migrants (New Jersey, New York, etc.). and initially many of them packed their politics with their pants, but I think finally some are waking up to what ruined their home states, and I hope they can course correct before they ruin mine.",

There are many other votes from counties across Iowa, including Des Moines itself. Trump has consistently led in Iowa, and a single poll with a sample of 800 people doesn\u2019t necessarily represent the hundreds of thousands of voters across the state. Polls aren\u2019t a definitive or objective method to forecast election results. Let the votes come in, and you\u2019ll see\u2014Trump will likely win Iowa by around 10 points.

Trump was right when he said if China succeeds in being able to build and ship their EVs here from Mexico, it would be an economic blood bath for our auto industry.   Regardless of union, this weighs heavily on the minds of workers whose livelihood could just disappear.   There are always worries and fears in the manufacturing sector. This is different, this time.  It's more real than it ever has been.   Fingers crossed for a repeat of 2016 with Michigan.",

She is a right winger but she\u2019s no nonsense no bullshit she doesn\u2019t fuck around and she verbally pulverizes the left with facts. Everyone forgot about Trump and his Mexican remark back in 2016 and he probably almost got their vote but now that stupid comedian he had probably cost him the Hispanic vote again or a large portion of it.

It was common sense, it was the country in dire need of strong leadership, it was the idea of how we as a country can longer stand the divide. When I came over I was always a secret conservative before, the values outweighed my liberal beliefs then by a lot. I\u2019d be outcasted for my firm beliefs because of it. I got so much flack for being in this side of the political spectrum than I did over in the left. It\u2019s blind hate and no real independence over there. You are really not allowed to think for yourself or you are labeled. \n\nI remember when I was still Democrat in 2016 I voted Hilary, I know, I know\u2026. Anyway I said that to a coworker who\u2019s a Military Vet who was also for Trump, and you know what he did? He shook my hand respectfully and thank me for exercising my rights and that was it. We were still friends. Now when I came over here I get called garbage, racist, fascist, idiot, moron, traitor, coward, and every insult under the sun.

I am a 20F .I am someone who is very shy and doesn\u2019t have many friends at all . \nI am a former democrat and now I am a trump supporter becauze I realized how much propaganda and lies were being told about him. I also see how more people thrived during his presidency. Myself included \n\nI  felt called to speak out on my instagram story. I have seen so much lies and propaganda and I just needed to expose it . I made a couple posts about how the economy and stuff was better under trump and I have made many posts exposing  Kamala and her lies and her fraudulent behavior , stupid policies etc . Many stuff I\u2019ve found on here , memes and what not \n\nHowever , I feel kinda hated for it . I already have low self esteem and struggle to make friends and everyone my age is like a brainwashed democrat who thinks black and white . I\u2019ve had people swipe up on my story  and call me disgusting . I\u2019ve lost many aquritances , potential friends , followers , destroyed relationships with family members and more.\nI truely believe in what I\u2019ve been posting and I belive I am doing the right thing but I know how brainwashed and black and white these folks are and I feel like I\u2019ve made my loneliness situation a lot worse now no one wants to be my friend now that I\u2019ve made these posts . \ndoes anyone have advice on how to be confident in your support for trump ? \nEven when so many people just see you as terrible for it .

Don\u2019t ban or push one or the other. Just have options and let it happen organically. Then when it came to his son transitioning, he did not like the way that was handled and started turning to the red side. I like Elons new mindset. I don\u2019t agree with him on everything and thats ok. I agree that him buying twitter did have a big impact on this election season. As well as facebook interfering less. I don\u2019t know about you guys, but I feel like trump won last time. I don\u2019t think Biden had as much support. Now Hillary vs Trump. I totally thought Hillary was going to win. So many people wanted to make history with a black president and then a woman president. But going back to this election, no one liked Kamala. She dropped out. She is already the sitting vice president. If she wants to do something, she can. Right now. People see that. The people voting for her are the people that are anti trump. People who are aligning with identity politics and people who want to make history. I just don\u2019t see any genuine support for Kamala. People that love Kamala for being Kamala. But we will see if the hate for trump is enough to keep him out of office. I just want the country to do well. So the people living in it can do well. Right now, I think Trump can do that for us. He learned a bunch and is doing much better with the way he handles things than he used to. I think he can get things done in a less divisive way and faster than he did before. Fingers crossed.",

In 2020, this lead went to the Democrats. However, this year Republicans lead once again with a margin of 41 per cent to 33 per cent.\n\nAcross all states, around 36 per cent of\u00a0[votes cast before election day\u00a0](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/03/us-presidential-election-2024-when-dates-candidates-voting/)have come from registered Republicans, compared to the Democrats\u2019 37.9 per cent.\n\nThis is the slimmest national gap on record between the two parties and a reflection of changing views on early voting which, historically, has favoured the Democrats.\n\nIn 2020, just 30.5 per cent of early votes were made by registered Republicans.\n\nAs many politicians were encouraging early voting due to the coronavirus pandemic, Donald Trump repeatedly raised\u00a0[suspicions about the practice.](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/10/31/polling-chaos-risk-undermining-us-election/)\n\nIn a series of tweets and conversations in September that year, he suggested that foreign countries could easily produce \u201ccounterfeit ballots\u201d.\n\nHe stated that the ballots were \u201cuncontrollable, totally open to election interference by foreign countries, and will lead to massive chaos and confusions\u201d.\n\nBut this year, the Republican party has encouraged members to adopt early voting. This has led to a surge in Republicans voting which, in turn, has pushed early votes to historic highs.\n\nAs of Monday evening, 78,185,854 early votes had been cast, equivalent to 49.4 per cent of the 2020 electoral turnout.\n\nThis is almost two-thirds higher than in 2016, when around one in three votes were cast before the election.\n\n**Read more from The Telegraph:** [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/04/republicans-take-lead-in-swing-state-early-voting/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/04/republicans-take-lead-in-swing-state-early-voting/)",
