Only a few bucked the trend.\n\nSo, Trump winning wasn't just the shock that started Meltdown 1.0. It was the fact that Killary lost. Combine that with Trump's win, and the screaming started. I don't think that happens tomorrow. I do not believe that women are in love with Kamala like they were with Killary Clinton. I just get the vibe that women will vote for her because of policy reasons, not because there's some great love for Kommila. Maybe I'm wrong, but I just don't see the adoration.\n\nWhat I do expect is another \"not my President\" movement. I also firmly believe that the lamestream media will announce that the country has entered a recession 48-hours after Trump wins. The country has been in one for awhile already, but don't expect the lamestream types to put that into print. Absolutely not. Not until it's needed. Finally, even the far left privately admits that the lamestream media is no longer trustworthy. Therefore, every poll is taken with a grain on salt. On all sides.\n\nMyself?

         "Trump has had so much support this election. Majority of the people I know are or have voted for trump already. I only personally know 2 people voting for her- which says something because I have a large, diverse family & friend group. I work with mostly all females, and the only male in the group is voting for Harris. \n\nKeep in mind that the demographic most likely to answer polls- are liberal women. Not very representative of the entire nation. Older folks and men aren\u2019t really going to be answering polls, they want to be left alone OR simply are not able to access internet (or don\u2019t want to) due to age- yes, even in this day and age- there\u2019s still a lot of older folk who don\u2019t have internet or cell phones. Obviously that\u2019s not everyone, but still a large group of people we forget about.\n\nHarris has had her campaign blown up on social media & has paid lots of high profile celebrities to speak at her rallys/endorse her as president. I mean, what, Beyonc\u00e9 was paid $10 mil to speak at her rally. These things really give the illusion that she\u2019s more favorable than she is, which is the goal of her campaign. Talk less, smile more, make others do the talking. I just cannot see how someone so\u2026 well, unqualified could make it this far. Am I saying she\u2019s not qualified experience wise? No not necessarily, I mean, we\u2019re voting for trump, who hadnt been involved in politics much at all until elected. BUT it\u2019s her intelligence and communication skills that are SEVERELY lacking in this aspect. It\u2019s embarrassing to watch. I can\u2019t imagine her speaking to any other important leaders of other nations, or giving presidential addresses, etc. it\u2019s the feeling you get when you see the really drunk girl at the bar trying to dance on the table. You know, \u201cshould we really let her do this?\u201d, \u201csomeone should maybe stop her before this gets worse\u201d, etc. \n\nGuys. If she gets in, I think we know what happened.",

Neighborhoods that flew Kerry, Kaine, and Obama signs proudly are not flying the Kamala flag, and when you see the local Democrats placing their signs out, it's in front of unsold houses, undeveloped lots, and public land.  On my own street, three of my neighbors removed their signs one by one as she continued to bumble and stumble her way through her teleprompted campaign, it's not that they aren't still voting for her, but they're damn sure not as proud of it.\n\nAt work I spent seven years in a position as the lone white person on my crew, before my promotion in September, and slowly but surely over the last two years I've watched all but two of them turn from heavily negative on Trump and become vocal supporters and voters for him.\n\nA lot of people in Virginia are sick of the rhetoric without results that the Dems have slung over our state for years and years.  Youngkin showed a lot of Virginia that the Governor's chair isn't just a free paycheck for some scumbag to do nothing in, and the events of London County still ring through the schools across the state.\n\nI will personally be surprised if we go full red, but I don't think we're going to be as blue as people seem to think.  Our polls were tainted by the fact that the Virginia native is the minority of the states population because of so many interstate migrants (New Jersey, New York, etc.). and initially many of them packed their politics with their pants, but I think finally some are waking up to what ruined their home states, and I hope they can course correct before they ruin mine.",

They\u2019re paying into Medicare and social security but not getting the reward at the end of the rat race. \n\nTo make matters worse, they\u2019re taking all the shitty, high labor, low pay jobs that most white Americans don\u2019t want to do. It\u2019s almost always back breaking uneducated labor jobs. \n\nMight be a better argument to say that we should catch and fine/charge all the employers that are hiring and exploiting undocumented labor. \n\nIf there are enough Americans willing to work, we wouldn\u2019t need undocumented labor.

         "As a lifelong Democrat for 16 years, I made the choice to move over to this party and vote. It wasn\u2019t influence, it wasn\u2019t power, it wasn\u2019t presentation. It was common sense, it was the country in dire need of strong leadership, it was the idea of how we as a country can longer stand the divide. When I came over I was always a secret conservative before, the values outweighed my liberal beliefs then by a lot. I\u2019d be outcasted for my firm beliefs because of it. I got so much flack for being in this side of the political spectrum than I did over in the left. It\u2019s blind hate and no real independence over there. You are really not allowed to think for yourself or you are labeled. \n\nI remember when I was still Democrat in 2016 I voted Hilary, I know, I know\u2026. Anyway I said that to a coworker who\u2019s a Military Vet who was also for Trump, and you know what he did? He shook my hand respectfully and thank me for exercising my rights and that was it. We were still friends. Now when I came over here I get called garbage, racist, fascist, idiot, moron, traitor, coward, and every insult under the sun. But when I look back to that day when I was hand shook by Republican just for doing what is right, I know where I belonged. So anyway god bless you, all, and let\u2019s win us our country back and let\u2019s take out the garbage!",

Plus the supreme court ruled that in PA any mail in ballots with no date on them can't be counted so that's also great news for us. Only time will tell of course though.",
         "Oh yes most definitely!",
         "My whole family votes red!",
         "\ud83e\udd23 okay okay I'll start holding my breath after I vote tomorrow. Though if I died my vote may mysteriously be cast for Harris and I do not want that!",
         "You can vote when you\u2019re dead according to democrats",
         "Who's to say they'll want to poll Amish folks? They're all voting for Trump and they can't at all let their followers think that Trump might win the election. If they do that, they'll have no way to manipulate the Dems and libs into rioting.",
         "The Amish traditionally do not vote.  ...but this year, the Pennsylvania state government decided it would be a good idea to raid an Amish farm.\n\nSo now they're voting.",
         "Apparently the ground game has motivated tens of thousands of Amish to vote for Trump.",
         "Damn any other recommendations to look at the polls I assume it's a bit late now",
         "Agreed. I think that\u2019s the state we\u2019re all watching. If PA goes red, we win. If it goes blue, we can still win! \n\nJust make sure you vote regardless of where you live.",
         "Fair, I just often associate NV with CA because of location.",
         "Gods let her loose MI!",
         "The pollster weighed the poll 7 to 1 democrats to republicans.   And even still had Trump only losing by 3.",
         "Emerson has Trump up by double digits in Iowa, Emerson is also an accurate pollster",
         "polls are asking people to disclose how they voted, predictions are guesses-- not actually asking people",
         "The democrats mail in lead is substantially cut as well. \n\nIn 2020 they had a 1,000,000 early vote firewall advantage. \n\nIn 2022 they had a 750,000 early vote firewall advantage.  \n\nThey stated they want a 700,000 early vote firewall advantage but once that became clear it wouldn\u2019t happen they stated they must have a 500,000 advantage. \n\nThey barely hold a 400,000 lead. It\u2019s 60% short of where they were in 2020 and 20% off what they stated was their must hit minimum. \n\nUsually you can\u2019t put much weight on polls, but right now polls, betting odds, early vote indicators and party registration all show Trump up a healthy amount. \n\nUsually when you have a single candidate indicator sweep it\u2019s extremely difficult to overcome. So I predict PA isn\u2019t really in to much danger. \n\nThe same is going on with Nevada btw, I seriously doubt Nevada doesn\u2019t turn red this election. However Wisconsin is mixed indicator so it\u2019s more likely to stay blue than Nevada is to stay blue. \n\nIt\u2019s also important to remember Trump is up in the polling but that\u2019s not the full story. On average every election Trump has participated in the polling was skewed against him on average 4.5 points in PA (higher in MI and WI). \n\nIn theory they should try to correct against this and be more accurate, but 2020 they should have done the same but they were farther off than in 2016. So we could very possibly see a 3-5 point lead come out of there.",
         "Once again, despite liberal claims of inclusivity, the Democrat party has ignored the votes of vampires and undead. They only care about the fully dead vote.",
         "I would take most polls with a grain of salt.\n\nWhile I think Trump has a slight edge on Harris, it is very slight and this election really could go either way. I wouldn\u2019t trust the Iowa +3 poll or any that claim Iowa will flip blue, but I also wouldn\u2019t trust anyone or any polls saying New Hampshire or Virginia will flip red. We\u2019ll see though.",
         "If we lose PA, we\u2019ll need GA and AZ to win followed by either MI or WI",
         "Yeah it's looking very good for him right now but only time will tell.",
         "New Hampshire and Nevada is also a winning combo.",
         "NH just not realistic though",
         "I love that we have so many paths to victory tomorrow. But keep being persistent and telling everyone you know to vote.",
         "Polling averages have him down 5 points, but polls in 2016 and 2020 had him down like 6-7 in states he won or lost by a hair.",
         "Tru but I can't imagine a scenario where he loses PA and somehow surges in NH"

As someone in their 20\u2019s, pretty much everyone I know (high school, college, etc) all are very vocal on their stance of why they love Harris but if I were to say the same for Trump the backlash is immeasurable.
