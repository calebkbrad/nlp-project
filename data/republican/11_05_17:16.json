He does not endorse Pr0ject 2025. He did not ban transitioning for consenting adults. He did not not ban gay people from adopting.

Let\u2019s also say that I\u2019m a minority in almost every (common sensual) way. I befriended a lot of left leaning people before the election, and I love them dearly. I truly and genuinely hope that whoever becomes president will do right by this country. I know that\u2019s a lot of faith for very corrupt people, however I\u2019m sick of the mindset of hating your neighbor/friend/family for voting on opposing views. I used to be the very opposite of what I\u2019m preaching, so I\u2019m very familiar with that mindset. If I told myself even a year ago that I was voting for Trump, I\u2019d probably cuss myself out or think I was delusional\u2026 like for real. I was very anti Trump, anti Republican Party, and anti anyone who supported anything to do with Republican/libertarian views. I do not agree with every point that Trump has made, so let\u2019s be clear about that. I 100% do not agree on how he wants to handle the wars having to do with Gaza/Palestine and Ukraine. The one thing I will say though is we do NOT need to be funding other wars and genocides while our nations people continue to suffer unemployment, a housing crisis, and inflation. Additionally, however, I have been very fond of taking care of American citizens and an economic boom. This would mean creating mass job opportunities, allowing for energy in the US, and allowing those who want to be legal citizens in the country. I also want to see more done about crime, mass sh00tings, and policing which I feel like Trump and Kamala have been silent and/or have not really spoken on. I did a lot of research and watch both candidates speak in interviews, rallies, and more. I made an informed decision, but it sucks that I can\u2019t tell anyone who I voted for. No advice needed here, but I thought I\u2019d just share a perspective that some could relate to. \n\nAlso a swing state voter lol.",

I know he won't be able to fix everything they did wrong be hopefully he can fix a good chunk of it. Cause I'm sick of being ck to ck and everytime raising every 6mo. When Trump was in office last time my car insurance went down twice since bidens been there it's raised 4xs and now is double what I was paying. Food has tripled my rent went up 45% over the past 2.5yr and I was at the same rent price for 6yrs. Everything is getting out of control and we need it fix or this country is going to see it's ppl turn on the government and start wars here.",

Only a few bucked the trend.\n\nSo, Trump winning wasn't just the shock that started Meltdown 1.0. It was the fact that Killary lost. Combine that with Trump's win, and the screaming started. I don't think that happens tomorrow. I do not believe that women are in love with Kamala like they were with Killary Clinton. I just get the vibe that women will vote for her because of policy reasons, not because there's some great love for Kommila. Maybe I'm wrong, but I just don't see the adoration.\n\nWhat I do expect is another \"not my President\" movement. I also firmly believe that the lamestream media will announce that the country has entered a recession 48-hours after Trump wins. The country has been in one for awhile already, but don't expect the lamestream types to put that into print. Absolutely not. Not until it's needed. Finally, even the far left privately admits that the lamestream media is no longer trustworthy. Therefore, every poll is taken with a grain on salt. On all sides.\n\nMyself?

That story is a long story but basically the child of an immigrant killed 3 young girls ages 3-8 and stabbed a dozen other people.  There were riots, British people were told by our government to shut up or we\u2019re racist and then were arrested for voicing concerns.  The UK is in big trouble",

Not very representative of the entire nation. Older folks and men aren\u2019t really going to be answering polls, they want to be left alone OR simply are not able to access internet (or don\u2019t want to) due to age- yes, even in this day and age- there\u2019s still a lot of older folk who don\u2019t have internet or cell phones. Obviously that\u2019s not everyone, but still a large group of people we forget about.\n\nHarris has had her campaign blown up on social media & has paid lots of high profile celebrities to speak at her rallys/endorse her as president. I mean, what, Beyonc\u00e9 was paid $10 mil to speak at her rally. These things really give the illusion that she\u2019s more favorable than she is, which is the goal of her campaign. Talk less, smile more, make others do the talking. I just cannot see how someone so\u2026 well, unqualified could make it this far. Am I saying she\u2019s not qualified experience wise? No not necessarily, I mean, we\u2019re voting for trump, who hadnt been involved in politics much at all until elected. BUT it\u2019s her intelligence and communication skills that are SEVERELY lacking in this aspect. It\u2019s embarrassing to watch. I can\u2019t imagine her speaking to any other important leaders of other nations, or giving presidential addresses, etc. it\u2019s the feeling you get when you see the really drunk girl at the bar trying to dance on the table. You know, \u201cshould we really let her do this?\u201d, \u201csomeone should maybe stop her before this gets worse\u201d, etc. \n\nGuys. If she gets in, I think we know what happened.",

Youngkin showed a lot of Virginia that the Governor's chair isn't just a free paycheck for some scumbag to do nothing in, and the events of London County still ring through the schools across the state.\n\nI will personally be surprised if we go full red, but I don't think we're going to be as blue as people seem to think.  Our polls were tainted by the fact that the Virginia native is the minority of the states population because of so many interstate migrants (New Jersey, New York, etc.). and initially many of them packed their politics with their pants, but I think finally some are waking up to what ruined their home states, and I hope they can course correct before they ruin mine.",

There are many different interpretations about what the mark of the beast is, but what we do know is that it's not the Antichrist who implements it, it's the false prophet, and this Mark will also be connected to a financial system, because no one will be able to buy or sell.. \n\n that's a quick overview of how the Bible describes this new world order",

         "I didn't vote for Trump to be my pastor, I voted for him to be the president.   \nI highly doubt he's a Christian, And in 2016 it was because of that reason that I did not vote...  \n  \n yet afterwards, I started to see what he wanted to do, I started to see the policies that he enacted, I started to see the freedoms that people of faith were able to freely exercise...   \n  \nAnd then, when Joe Biden was president, I saw what he wanted to do with this country... I saw how he ended the energy deal that Trump made, which resulted in the price of gas skyrocketing at day one, I saw how weak and fragile our nation became, I saw the rights and freedoms of Christians be trampled upon...  \n  \nand when you put up his policies with that of Kamala Harris, such as her desire to murder the unborn all the way up to birth, to mutilate young children, To oversexualize children without the consent of the parents, to let men into woman's bathrooms, and to completely upend The Judeo Christian principles that this country was founded upon...  \n  \nI will gladly vote for Trump every single day over Kamala Harris.  \nBecause, as Romans 132 says, those who approve of such things will suffer the wrath of God.  \nIt's extremely apparent that Kamala openly defends and supports the unrighteousness of sinners, and Trump, while he is no perfect person himself, and he has faults, at least he's willing to say that they are wrong, and that basic Christian principles should be upheld  \n  \nProverbs 4:27  \nDo not turn to the right or to the left; turn your foot from evil.\n\nAs a Christian myself, I highly highly recommend that you go out and vote for Donald Trump, not because he's the Republican choice, but because voting for him is turning our foot away from the evil that Kamala Harris wants to impose on every single American.",

I never said I was foaming at the mouth in rage, no, that's not what the Bible tells us to do. Now, if you have a problem with Trump, that's on you, not me... \n\nFrom the way you responded to me from what I said, it's very apparent that there's something deeper going on here in you and, to be honest, I have no desire to poke that wound, because it looks like it's a very fresh wound...  \n  \n I was not trying to get into a debate with you, I was giving you the reason as to why I am voting for Trump, and I was trying to encourage you to do the same, because the policies that Donald Trump stands for are more in line with our faith than that of Kamala Harris.",
         "Another angry reply. This one you went with a personal attack towards me having a mythical deeper problem. Even though I too am a Republican and I too am a Christian.\n\nHere is the reply you obviously so desperately need....\n\nIt isn't about Kamala or Trump for me. It's about the Lamb of God. God calls on Christian's alone to be ambassadors for God. Representatives on this earth. As there are zero Christian's running there are zero people for me to vote for. You can look at corrinthians for that little Token of knowledge.\n\nTrump is ok with abortion, an adulterer (this is not because of him being a sexual offender but instead due to him being divorced), doesn't believe in Christ being King, and defiled the book of God by putting man's laws in it. \n\nKamala is also straight disgusting for her own reasons I don't need to go down to.\n\nSome people say that voting for Trump is voting for the lesser of two evils. News flash, you don't have to vote for anything evil. You can stay home. I'm not trying to be on the \"right side of history\" on earth. I'm aiming to be on the right side of the Lord our God. And I will absolutely not be voting for anyone in this election. I will be staying home. And there is absolutely nothing you or anyone else can do to change that for myself and millions of other objective Christian's in this nation that have chosen to stay home.",
         "So in other words, you're willing to potentially damn our entire nation because the objectively better candidate isn't a saint?\n\nI assume this means you never vote then, right?\n\nI really don't understand this logic. Option A is massively flawed but tries to do right by the nation. Option B is evil and stands for the opposite of everything in your faith. So your decision is to role the dice on evil and do nothing?"
