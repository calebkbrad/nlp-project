That means the presumption of innocence applies, so there were no underlying crimes, which means the misdemeanors couldn't be elevated to felonies.  That's before we get to the star witness being someone who had already been caught, tried, and convicted of perjuring himself against Trump on three prior occasions (and got caught doing it again during this trial), or the judge's illegal jury instructions.",

Saying God doesn't intervene is a claim you can't prove and there is evidence to the contrary. Given that, it is more reasonable to say that, if God exists, He doesn't intervene in all cancer cases. And that is certainly true. God doesn't always intervene and there is reason for that explained in the Bible.\n\nIf you create a model of God that doesn't align with the model of God from the Bible and you argue against that, then you have created a straw god and are not actually debating with anyone except your own inaccurate perception of God.\n\nThat said, no one is saying not to vote, no one is saying we shouldn't also rely on ourselves to make the change we want in the world. \n\nYour comments here serve nothing but really to spite this version of God you conceive of but no one argues exist. I argue that the God of the Bible exists, not the God rangerhawk824 thinks is in the Bible.",
         "Prayer is powerful. If you are not inclined to believe that, fine, but do you think your comment helps? Nowhere is it suggested here that we should not vote.\n\nMake comments that help.",
         "Its as if there is a plan, and praying for things to not go according to the plan will not alter the plan.  Prayer is not a guarantee of getting what you want.\n\nGod has three answers to prayer: yes, no, and wait a while.\n\nI can pray for Trump to win - but if God's plan is that the end times are now, then Harris may need to win in order for that to happen.  We will see.",
         "My husband and I just had this conversation.  Hopefully I can explain it via text.  God is like the parent taking away candy and telling them to eat their vegetables when their kids hate eating vegetables.  When bad things happen and you can\u2019t understand why God would do something like that you have to step back and realize it\u2019s so something else can be revealed.  If you close your eyes to God just because things don\u2019t go your way you, might miss it.  Prayer does work but it\u2019s not a magic wand.  I personally feel we need to have on going prayer with the Lord and try and read and understand his word in order to make sense of our crazy world.  Today my prayers will be for the safety and peace for those voting, of our election workers and candidates and little if any signs of fraud.  I will be praying that tomorrow there will be a clear choice on who was the winner and people of the United States will have no reason to contest the results.  I will also put in a bit about Trump being President  that the majority of those elected today will be Republicans or not far left Democrats.",
         "Not taking this as snarky either. Good question. \n\nFriends who escaped the USSR to Israel prayed toward Jerusalem, which was to the south. The tradition is based on the Dedication Prayer of King Shlomo found in Divrei Hayamim II (II Chronicles) 6 where Shlomo talks about Israel praying toward the Temple. Most synagogues in the U.S. have the \"Ark\" on the eastern wall, some do not have the building made that way, but when there are prayers about Jerusalem the congregants still face east. Where I attend the Ark is on the western wall, but then we are on the west coast of the US, so it works.",
         "A good English translation is, \"I give thanks before you, King living and eternal, for You have returned within me my soul with compassion; abundant is Your faithfulness.\"",
         "Prove it. When does he intervene? The burden of proof is on you, not me.",
         "Thanks for getting back to me.  I live in Columbus, Ohio and I have never heard about this until reading Daniel.  Ironically enough our house has windows on the North,(Front) and South,(back), of the house.  My favorite place to pray is in our living room looking out the south window slightly to the east.  We are also currently building an addition at the back of our house for our Master bedroom so to get the eastern exposure in the mornings that I have been longing for.  When sitting on my patio alone at night I often pray/talk to God and find myself looking off into that direction as well.  Though it was my preference but thinking there could be more to it. Thanks for sharing this with me.\u2600\ufe0f\u2600\ufe0f\u2600\ufe0f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f",
         "I love it and will screen shot.  I try and pray every morning before opening my eyes and getting out of bed.  I thank God for creating another day for me and my loved ones. And thank him for being in my life and giving me the opportunity to exist and experience the world he created.   This prayer seems to be very similar but more to the point.",
         "Requiring proof would involve a lack of faith, which is a fundamental part of Christianity. Something you don't understand, obviously. Nor do you want to.",
         "Prayer can be three things, 1) a conversation, perhaps seemingly one-sided, between you and God, sharing your thoughts (that He already knows) 2) petitionary, asking for things. A Rabbi once told me, \"We pray for rain, not on our own crops, but for our neighbors' crops, and maybe some rain will fall on our crops too.\" So I pray for good things for friends and family, and when something good comes my way, HALLELUJAH! and 3) judgment, when we pray Ha Shem is judging us.\n\n***\n\nI'm a non-Jew, but I follow the Jewish path as a Gentile. I've tried to convert three times and each time bad things happened. Once I lost my job suddenly the day I signed up for conversion classes, then six years later I was signed up again and boom again lost my job. I gave up for a few years but then I announced at shul my intentions, and before I could sign up for classes the CovidScam hit. All the classes went to online, and only the Reform classes were available. So I think I'm stuck being a Shabbos Goy, and I love the people in the shul I attend, altho this last few months have been over Zoom because I had a skin infection I could not get past. Started in April and I still have a little of it left. Staph infections can be passed in various ways, so since the majority of the shul members are 70+, I've stayed home and Zoomed. Today I get to see the dermie and see if she says I'm fully cleared. The High Holidays online were not as good as being there, and Reb Dennis does such a wonderful show on Yom Kippur. One of our members is a retired opera singer and her singing \"Avinu Malkeinu\" is amazing.",

Let\u2019s also say that I\u2019m a minority in almost every (common sensual) way. I befriended a lot of left leaning people before the election, and I love them dearly. I truly and genuinely hope that whoever becomes president will do right by this country. I know that\u2019s a lot of faith for very corrupt people, however I\u2019m sick of the mindset of hating your neighbor/friend/family for voting on opposing views. I used to be the very opposite of what I\u2019m preaching, so I\u2019m very familiar with that mindset. If I told myself even a year ago that I was voting for Trump, I\u2019d probably cuss myself out or think I was delusional\u2026 like for real. I was very anti Trump, anti Republican Party, and anti anyone who supported anything to do with Republican/libertarian views. I do not agree with every point that Trump has made, so let\u2019s be clear about that. I 100% do not agree on how he wants to handle the wars having to do with Gaza/Palestine and Ukraine. The one thing I will say though is we do NOT need to be funding other wars and genocides while our nations people continue to suffer unemployment, a housing crisis, and inflation. Additionally, however, I have been very fond of taking care of American citizens and an economic boom. This would mean creating mass job opportunities, allowing for energy in the US, and allowing those who want to be legal citizens in the country. I also want to see more done about crime, mass sh00tings, and policing which I feel like Trump and Kamala have been silent and/or have not really spoken on. I did a lot of research and watch both candidates speak in interviews, rallies, and more. I made an informed decision, but it sucks that I can\u2019t tell anyone who I voted for. No advice needed here, but I thought I\u2019d just share a perspective that some could relate to. \n\nAlso a swing state voter lol.",

         "Donald Trump might pull this off. It\u2019s too early to say; we might not know till the middle of next year, or whenever some\u00a0[antediluvian state finishes counting by hand](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/05/us-presidential-election-2024-when-dates-candidates-voting/). Plus Electoral College madness means that Trump could surge in the popular vote yet still lose via Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan (the reverse Hillary). But consider the following:\n\nFirst, he took\u00a0[Florida easily, including Miami-Dade](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/05/us-election-latest-news-polling-trump-kamala/). Joe Biden won that county in 2020; Hillary Clinton swept it by nearly 30 points in 2016. What\u2019s made the difference? Trump\u2019s doing well among Latino voters, presumably men.\n\nSecond, there are hints he\u2019s gained ground among the affluent in Virginia, which is supposed to be a lock for Kamala; Wasps with degrees are her people.\n\nThird, he seems to be scooping Georgia, which might have been competitive and certainly suggests the sun-belt is safe (Texas is also not in play). Fourth, an NBC exit poll gives him a six point advantage among independents in the critical state of Pennsylvania.\n\nExit polls generally indicate that\u00a0[\u201cthe future of democracy\u201d is a leading issue,](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/comment/2024/11/06/americans-voting-out-of-resentment-and-fear/)\u00a0which breathless TV commentators assumed was a good sign for Harris. But lots of Republicans think the Democrats stole the election in 2020, so they might be recording concern for that issue as well.\n\nThe other major matter is the economy, and Trump polls stronger than Kamala on that one for obvious reasons (ie inflation). No wonder election betting seems to slightly favour Republicans, along with the\u00a0*New York Times*\u00a0and Decision Desk HQ.\n\nBut, yes, there\u2019s a long night ahead, and none of us knows anything for sure. It\u2019s a delight to watch British TV presenters disclose the latest thing they read on CNN as if it were a personal insight (\u201dI\u2019m predicting now that Harris will take Vermont and the Pope will carry the Vatican\u201d).\n\nBut what we can decisively say at this juncture is that of the four options \u2013 Trump easy win, narrow win; Harris narrow win, easy win \u2013 the Harris easy win is off the table. Despite January 6, a rape trial, \u201ceating the pets\u201d and a comedian calling Puerto Rico a \u201cfloating island of garbage\u201d. I wonder if Joe Biden might have done better?\n\n**Read more from The Telegraph:** [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/comment/2024/11/06/its-beginning-to-look-like-donald-trump-is-going-to-win/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/comment/2024/11/06/its-beginning-to-look-like-donald-trump-is-going-to-win/)",
