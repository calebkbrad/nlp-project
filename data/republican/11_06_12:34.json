I\u2019ve seen people who took their sobriety seriously relapse due to loved ones dying or losing their jobs or homes. For example, there was a mother who was clean for 20 plus years and unfortunately her daughter who rarely used drugs overdosed on a fake Xanax (laced with fentanyl). Her daughter was only 17 when she died. That poor lady wanted to end her life by taking a hot shot and it took her everything in her power to not do that. I\u2019m sorry if you relapse because of a political election then you probably didn\u2019t want to get clean in the first place, that or you just want attention.

Even I finally was like \u201cOh wait\u2026this all makes me extremely uncomfortable, what the f*ck is even going on.\u201d Even I finally was like \u201cOkay wait I think I love my country enough that this all has to be stopped\u201d. My husband and I also started TTC this year and I think having to realistically think about my future children\u2019s future flipped a switch. I am SO proud to say that I, a WOMAN, VOTED RED, for me, for all women, and for my future children!!!",
         "As a woman i absolutely wanted to protect my rights, thats why i voted for Trump,",
         "All of this!!!",
         "The real irony is that now women can actually vote, at a state level, on the \u201crights\u201d they want. We all can. The less federal overreach, the better we all are.",
         "Thank you for saying this. I\u2019m absolutely mind blown by all the posts & comments I\u2019m seeing about women terrified, crying, and so anxious about their rights and the rights of their children. He has literally been the president before and what rights did we lose? All he did was allow states to make decisions on abortions, so if that\u2019s what they\u2019re upset about, they should be mad at their own state. I\u2019m in disbelief at the delusional things I\u2019m seeing.\n\nI had a MC in January and had no problems getting the medical care I needed. I\u2019m currently expecting a son & daughter. I voted red FOR my kids. I want them to be safe in our country, have rights, and not have to eat poisoned food.",
         "Trump doesn\u2019t even have any real control over that iirc, it\u2019s down to the states. Not 100% sure, so feel free to correct me",
         "The liberal party needs to learn they can\u2019t just win elections by planting us as the worst humans alive on planet Earth while also preaching about inclusivity and bringing the country together\n\nHarris would have been so bad at bringing anyone together and even if she pulled off a Hail Mary in 2024 she would have been smoked even worse than this in 2028\n\nNew Jersey at a lean margin is insane!!",
         "Well, my family - to my surprise - all voted for Trump. I was sure my leftist son wouldn't, but he said, and I quote, \"I couldn't bear even the thought of hearing her cackling one more day!\"",
         "Whenever I see a leftist say something about they want to protect their daughters abilities to have an abortion I hit them with \u201cSo you\u2019re okay with her having a train ran through her frequently without consequences.\u201d And it usually gets them to shut up",
         "It\u2019s disgusting how they paint us as immoral! I 100% agree with you",
         "It's crazy to me. Ive heard people from the left spouting off things like JD Vance wants to track women's periods, and a Republican government will put them to death if they need abortions for any reason. Those same people say that trump ran and won on a campaign of fearmongering and propaganda. Absolutely wild",
         "\u201cRelax, you can still abort all the babies you want\u201d is what I want to say to these brainwashed liberals.",
         "You hit the high points on how the \"progressives\" are nothing close to progress.",
         "1000% agree with this statement. Now I feel women should have the right to choice what to do with their bodies but the left is over looking all the bs they are trying to take and only focusing on that one thing. And maybe if they protected them self with birth control condoms and the other ways they wouldn't need abortion so much.",
         "Trump didn't have a pro or anti women's rights platform. The entire thing was a strawman policy they campaigned against.\u00a0\n\n\nIt's probably why they lost. They weren't campaigning against real issues",
         "Bravo. But with politics the truth doesn't matter, just what people believe.",
         "helll yeahhh we love our women, thats why we voted \u2764\ufe0f\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8",
         "I keep telling my lefty friends \u201cnobody wants to take your right to murder your ugly annoying baby in a demonstration of piety to your dark god molech\u201d , we just want \u201ccommon sense abortion legislation\u201d .",
         "Don\u2019t forget the Democratic Party is in office and hasn\u2019t issued the reinstatement of roe v wade\u2026 I wonder why they aren\u2019t getting it done?",
         "Everything you said is true \ud83d\udc4f",
         "Republicans haven\u2019t taken abortion away! They just deferred to the states. Now the citizens of each state get to choose their own abortion laws.",
         "I voted this year only for my daughter.",
         "100% agreed!\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffd\n\nUnfortunately abortion is not a right, it\u2019s a privilege. Since abortion is a service, we don\u2019t have an unalienable right to abortion, since it\u2019s predicated on another individual performing that service. \nIt should be a states issue, just as our founding fathers intended. It\u2019s not a *right* that needs to be protected under federal law.\n\nI voted for Trump, but I also voted for abortion access in my state election. A women\u2019s right to abortion now lies in a state election, and this likely won\u2019t be a presidential issue ever again.\n\nTo each their own, but I find it weird that abortion is a voting issue for some people. It feels like an uninformed take. You want to \u201cprotect\u201d your child getting cream pied and their ability to abort the fetus? Lol. It\u2019s so strange. \n\nMost people will go their whole life without having an abortion. It\u2019s an issue that won\u2019t affect the majority of Americans. Yet the economy, taxes, and inflation we feel every. Single. Day. And that\u2019s not a voting issue for these people!? Go figure.",
         "Nailed it",
         "Nailed it \ud83d\udc4f",
         "I do have a question and hoping to not get blasted. \nAs far as the abortion piece-While I don't agree with it. \nI can be on hesitation/potential on board if it's before 8 weeks and/or for medical issues(threat to the mother), forced entry(don't wanna say it), or incest. \n\nWith states like Texas-the ban includes medical correct? \n\nAnyways, on board with all of what you said otherwise.",
         "So OP, you prefer your daughter to die than to have the possibility to abort an unviable fetus causing her severe complications? Quite cruel. Hard ti believe millions of mothers in USA actually prefer death to their daughters.",
         "I thought they tried and failed. I don't see the issue. It gave voters and states more power. If you want more or less abortion get out and vote for the appropriate candidate. Or move to another state.",
         "They had all the branches and a supermajprity in 2008.  They could've done it then.  It's nothing but a voting issue for them, they don't believe their own rhetoric",
         "Exactly they had many chances to pass something since roe v wade ruling to when it was overturned yet did nothing.",
         "To be honest, I don't think prices will go down... I'm thinking we will have more money to buy the groceries. Regulated prices like gas... And corn.... Might go down... But the idea is to have a better job making or keeping more of your money earned to spend it...",
         "Thank you for this. I just got into a huge argument with my mom because she couldn\u2019t believe how I could vote red. I also considered myself a Dem for my entire life up until the last few years. I\u2019m glad to see I\u2019m not the only one going through this shift",
         "You are right Supreme court made a statement that no president will be able to change it and it is a state by state thing.",
         "Texas allows for medical but most states allow for all the exceptions",
         "Even RBG said that *Roe* needed to be overturned and she further said that if it came to the Court, she would vote to overturn. She died before that happened, but even as blue as she is, she understood that *Roe* was a bad ruling, as it legislates and that is not the job of the Court. Giving power back to the states to decide is the correct decision.",
         "You are both in good company! Don\u2019t forget, Trump, Elon, Tulsi and RFK Junior all used to be Democrats too. :-)",
         "If women are really that concerned about getting access to abortion, either move or travel to a state that allows abortion.",
         "Honestly RFK was the reason I even decided to start hearing yall out lol. I loved him and then we he endorsed Trump it was a no-brainer for me!",
         "Or become more engaged in your local elections (which should be the norm)"

I've watched so many videos of parents and even kids reading pure smut that is available in their libraries to their school boards. They are straight up indoctrinating them. Kids are kids. Leave them alone. If they still want to transition when they are an adult, that is their choice and power to them.\n\nHowever, I have also seen de-transitioners talk of their experiences and how they were forced into it.

         "I\u2019m not saying nothing until I see 270 by Trumps name.",
         "Donald Trump might pull this off. It\u2019s too early to say; we might not know till the middle of next year, or whenever some\u00a0[antediluvian state finishes counting by hand](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/05/us-presidential-election-2024-when-dates-candidates-voting/). Plus Electoral College madness means that Trump could surge in the popular vote yet still lose via Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan (the reverse Hillary). But consider the following:\n\nFirst, he took\u00a0[Florida easily, including Miami-Dade](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/05/us-election-latest-news-polling-trump-kamala/). Joe Biden won that county in 2020; Hillary Clinton swept it by nearly 30 points in 2016. What\u2019s made the difference? Trump\u2019s doing well among Latino voters, presumably men.\n\nSecond, there are hints he\u2019s gained ground among the affluent in Virginia, which is supposed to be a lock for Kamala; Wasps with degrees are her people.\n\nThird, he seems to be scooping Georgia, which might have been competitive and certainly suggests the sun-belt is safe (Texas is also not in play). Fourth, an NBC exit poll gives him a six point advantage among independents in the critical state of Pennsylvania.\n\nExit polls generally indicate that\u00a0[\u201cthe future of democracy\u201d is a leading issue,](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/comment/2024/11/06/americans-voting-out-of-resentment-and-fear/)\u00a0which breathless TV commentators assumed was a good sign for Harris. But lots of Republicans think the Democrats stole the election in 2020, so they might be recording concern for that issue as well.\n\nThe other major matter is the economy, and Trump polls stronger than Kamala on that one for obvious reasons (ie inflation). No wonder election betting seems to slightly favour Republicans, along with the\u00a0*New York Times*\u00a0and Decision Desk HQ.\n\nBut, yes, there\u2019s a long night ahead, and none of us knows anything for sure. It\u2019s a delight to watch British TV presenters disclose the latest thing they read on CNN as if it were a personal insight (\u201dI\u2019m predicting now that Harris will take Vermont and the Pope will carry the Vatican\u201d).\n\nBut what we can decisively say at this juncture is that of the four options \u2013 Trump easy win, narrow win; Harris narrow win, easy win \u2013 the Harris easy win is off the table. Despite January 6, a rape trial, \u201ceating the pets\u201d and a comedian calling Puerto Rico a \u201cfloating island of garbage\u201d. I wonder if Joe Biden might have done better?\n\n**Read more from The Telegraph:** [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/comment/2024/11/06/its-beginning-to-look-like-donald-trump-is-going-to-win/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/comment/2024/11/06/its-beginning-to-look-like-donald-trump-is-going-to-win/)",

For context, it is important to remember Joe was considered to be super mysterious and cool due to his basement strategy in 2020, so that's why he got 80 bazillion votes. Kamala made the mistake of appearing in public during her campaign, and so people were a little less excited after her thrilling whirlwind 90 day campaign adventure.\n\nThat's what we should take away from this and not at all get sucked into a vortex of lies about voter fraud, undemocratic actions to bypass the nominated candidate or her lack of popularity. Those are almost certainly dead ends, pushed by the minions of orange man.",

That means the presumption of innocence applies, so there were no underlying crimes, which means the misdemeanors couldn't be elevated to felonies.  That's before we get to the star witness being someone who had already been caught, tried, and convicted of perjuring himself against Trump on three prior occasions (and got caught doing it again during this trial), or the judge's illegal jury instructions.",
