Apathy won, but it won\u2019t this time.\n\nOur ancestral sisters fought for our right to go to the polls. They fought for our rights to own a bank account\u2026  to participate with equity in the workplace\u2026 and for the ability to free ourselves from abuse. They fought for our bodily autonomy. We owe appreciation and gratitude to them, and we have the opportunity to thank them today. \n\nShow up and show out not only for yourselves, but for our future generations of women and girls. \n\nIf they want to take our rights away, we are gonna make it damn hard for them to do so. Let\u2019s show them how pissed we are that they\u2019d even consider any of it. \n\nThey won\u2019t take us back. Let\u2019s do this. \ud83d\udc99",

Many men in positions of power in the red states take women for granted and unless we stand up, that will continue.  We are the majority, let's make our voices and votes heard.  No matter whether you live in a swing state or not, remember EVERY office you vote for matters down to the school board.  Let's do this!",

I am one of the folks who didn\u2019t vote either, but now that we know what\u2019s at stake if we stay at the sidelines? We won\u2019t go back.",

I also didn\u2019t vote in 2016\u2026 the only thing I\u2019m ashamed about though was abstaining my vote all together\u2026 \n\nBut our great-great-grandmothers didn\u2019t fight for the right for us to sit by the sidelines\u2026 especially in a time where there are people out there saying that the 19th amendment should be repealed and we shouldn\u2019t be able to vote\u2026 we should keep that idea from gaining traction.",
         "I definitely don't want to wake up tomorrow morning with the same feeling I had the next morning back in 2016. \n\nIf T wins this one, I will be convinced this is some weird twilight zone sort of social experiment and we've all lost. self serving bias and hate over compassion and empathy for others who live differently.",

         "Thank you, that\u2019s a lovely sentiment. I\u2019m not stopping here, either. The only way is forward.",
         "It definitely is as a learning moment. I\u2019ll never sit out an election again. I\u2019m hoping we have a record turnout today and that the American people exercise their right to vote. I hope we preserve that right today.",
         "Necessity is the mother of invention. I wish the country didn't need these lessons, but that's how things work. Let's just hope that pendulum swung so far it smacks a brick wall when Harris wins. And gets STUCK.",
         "Actually the USA is pretty far behind on this metric.. lots of other countries have had female leaders.",
         "Thanks for doing it the first time, I wish I had. Maybe this is Hillary\u2019s legacy, to prime us for this moment. I\u2019m not a praying woman, but I\u2019m doing whatever the spiritual equivalent is today. I hope it sticks too.",
         "Me too! I remember going to vote for Hillary and feeling like it was a historic moment \u2026 and then we all know what happened. This time I\u2019m just keeping my head down and carrying on. Voted this morning and now my part is done (for today).",

         "Can you imagine being a suffragette and seeing women sit this out? I think of it as an insult to their legacy. We can move on from the shame of past apathy and we can move forward by participating and making our voices heard.",
         "Same same same. If he wins, it\u2019s a huge testimony to the lack of education and social media poison in this country. Things will be tense for a long time, but with concerted efforts the majority will win out.",
         "It\u2019s ok! I was apathetic in my youth as well. There\u2019s so much more at stake these days. \n\nI feel like when I first started voting almost 20 years ago \ud83d\ude33 you weren\u2019t going to be LOSING YOUR RIGHTS with the wrong candidate you know??? It\u2019s a bit different now!\n\nI did indeed vote for Hilary in 2016, and I truly hope Kamala wins this year!!!",
         "So true.  Our sisters fought so hard for that right, and we're not going to give it up in 2024.  No way.",
         "Yes, and just a reminder that local elections also really count! Thank you.",
         "The US is behind in quite a few metrics. Hopefully we can change that. We are capable.",
         "Yup wish I did a mail in ballot lol the line is so long but it\u2019s worth it",
         "Right?! I try to vote in every election that I know about. Every primary. Try to keep those abstained votes to a minimum over my voting life time.",
         "And heaven forbid, if this doesn\u2019t turn out, we don\u2019t stop there!!! We are not going to be quiet, we are not going to comply.",
         "Yes! I voted in the primary election and it\u2019s satisfying to vote again on candidates I supported in the primary. We should be voting at every opportunity. Politics affect everybody.",

Does it mean that if one says they want to be divorced but the other doesn't, they just can't divorce? That doesn't make sense to me, so I'm assuming I don't get it. How do you force someone to be married? So like they separate and just can't marry someone else since they can't get a divorce? Does no fault just mean they both split the assets and go?\n\nI'm sorry I'm not the brightest crayon over here. I feel like this is one of those things that sounds good but obviously isn't.\n\nEdit: i think I just got it. No-fault divorce is good but the GoP want to take it away.

I thought through GoP WANTED no-fault lol\n\nEdit 2: Just read more. This is crazy talk. You can't just force someone to stay married. What in the fuck is wrong with people. This is ludicrous to me.

Historically, they rarely chamge vote counts by more than 200 votes.\n\nAs an example, Biden won Pennsylvania in 2020 by about 50,000 votes, and that was considered crazy close. So, if you see \"projections show X winning, but Y asked for a recount and claims the election isn't over\", just keep these numbers in mind.\n\nThat would be the first step in any \"contested\" election.\n\nEdit: Wording to be more clear",

         "Oh that's so depressing",
         "Whew!",
         "Of course they do, because they know there\u2019s no real justification they can offer for patriarchy\u2019s treatment of women. \n\nThey can claim to be protectors only until we ask who we\u2019re being protected from and why.  The fact that most assaults are by intimate partners goes undisclosed and undiscussed unless they can shift blame to the women. \n\nThey can only claim to be providers when they rig the game so it\u2019s harder for us to be fully self-reliant.   (Making it harder to get workplace pay equity, all the unpaid labor women are expected to take on to let their \u201cprotectors\u201d relax once they get home from their jobs, etc.)",
         "Sure, with rare exceptions. Although it's difficult for a toxic person to hide their toxicity for very long from someone who is observant. \n\nThe point is that eliminating no fault divorce is not going to be a barrier to toxic men entering relationships. Some women went for toxic men back when divorce was difficult to obtain. Some will if it becomes difficult to obtain again.\n\nOne thing I do see changing if contraceptives and abortion are outlawed is that women might go back to being very resistant to sex before marriage. The change probably wouldn't happen overnight. But the forces that made sex outside of marriage very risky for women would be back in play. This is also one of the goals of social conservatives.",
         "Exactly!",
         "It's racism and internal misogyny for others (like traditional roles, aka \"women aren't leaders - but they're good at other stuff...like babies\").\n\nGranted there are definitely women voting against their own beliefs because their husband says to/they fear breaking away from the community hive - specifically Christians.",

         "Your last paragraph is the dream for them. They can trap a woman before the mask slips off, she moves quickly to accept a marriage proposal, because \"no sex before marriage,\" then she's stuck.\n\nI'm sure there are plenty of men who dated someone for a couple of years, the women saw the men's true colors and split. Those guys probably think that if they could have married them in the first year, then divorce wasn't allowed, they'd still have \"the one that got away.\"\nNot to mention all the men who were married for years, treated their wives like shit, then got pissed off when the women actually divorced them.",
         "I just found out that in NC, [husbands can legally accompany their wives in the booths.](https://ncnewsline.com/2024/10/25/alamance-county-married-couples-polling-booths/) \n\nMy jaw is still on the floor.",

         "Oh wow. How is that even a thing now? It defeats the whole purpose of democracy - although I suppose that is the purpose of it",
         "Based on how other middle-aged communities operate, a lot of these women are probably part of some church or Bible Study or private community group, or they're in some Telegram / messenger group. They don't see the Democrat's platform, only as it is filtered through conservative memes, podcasts, tiktok, etc.",
         "Pretty much.

I\u2019ve heard a lot of crazy stuff lately, especially as someone who has the misfortune of working around a lot of cons.",

         "Oh my god. A friend had a coworker tell her that he was sending his kids to private school for high school because the public ones were putting litter boxes in the bathrooms for the \"alphabet kids\" who identify as furries.

I'm not personally convinced the sex/gender of that person would necessarily matter all that much, although I am convinced that men have always used the idea of sex/gender as a way to keep power and dominate socially.\n\nIt would definitely be nice if I were proved completely wrong but there's really no way to test the theory ...

      "comments": [
         "These laws were often put in place to prevent men from leaving their pregnant spouses during pregnancy and then skipping out on their financial and parenting obligations. Women can still completely separate (including legal separation) from their spouse while pregnant and then a divorce is finalized shortly after the baby is born usually with no court appearance required. This is meant to protect pregnant women from getting a divorce agreement that doesn\u2019t include the necessary custody and child support provisions they need when their baby is born.",
         "That\u2019s a really poor article. All states have restrictions, even the bluest states. Divorces can\u2019t be finalized if the woman is still pregnant (doesn't matter if it\u2019s a same sex couple, and if both women are pregnant, it both babies have to be born). Primarily the reason behind this is that the child is going to be legally the child of both parents, and they'd just have to come back to family court (whether or not it's challenged). Need to get the child support and custody arrangement.",
         "Even in Illinois a few years ago, my lawyer said it\u2019s difficult to get a divorce if you\u2019re pregnant. I had to sign a document stating I wasn\u2019t pregnant.",
         "This doesn\u2019t make sense. It\u2019s not like men who were never married to a women get excused from child support",
         "It\u2019s concerning how women\u2019s rights are being chipped away from all sides lately. The freedoms my mother and grandmother had seem stronger than what we\u2019re left with today. \n\nIf a married woman were truly content, there would be no need to seek divorce. But in many cases, there could be domestic violence, verbal abuse, or other harmful dynamics. For pregnant women, this becomes not just an issue of emotional well-being but a serious health concern for both mother and baby, adding urgency to the need for protection. It\u2019s ultimately about survival and safety.",
         "No they don\u2019t, they have to go to family court just like people who get a divorce. That court case has to be brought by the mother seeking support in the case of a father trying to shirk his responsibilities. Waiting until after the baby is born makes this a one step process rather than separate divorce and child custody/support cases. \n\nIf you make the woman go back for support in a second case some women won\u2019t do that for a variety of reasons, this protects them.",
         "As multiple other people have stated, nothing is stopping someone from beginning the process, nor leaving their spouse.\n\nThere is so much bad shit going on right now where rights ARE being stripped away. Can we please try to focus on those versus going after something that\u2019s a non-issue?",
         "I understand and hear your frustration, but to say that our freedoms are weaker than those of our mothers and grandmothers is simply untrue, and severely downplays their struggles. It wasn\u2019t until 1937 that women in the US could initiate divorce at all. (Had to google that because I'm from Europe.) It wasn\u2019t until the 1970s that women could get credit cards or take out a loan on their own, without a man co-signing on it. \n\nYes, reproductive rights and women\u2019s rights altogether are crumbling around the world, but we are not worse off than our ancestors just yet, though we do need to fight to uphold what they built for us.",
         "I think there is also a need to distinguish legal divorce from physical separation. It\u2019s not necessarily right or okay that a woman cannot get divorced if she\u2019s pregnant, but it does not mean she is not able to leave or get out of an abusive or dangerous situation. She can be accepted by women\u2019s shelters, DV shelters, or even just a friend or family member\u2019s house where her partner can\u2019t get to her. \n\nThese things don\u2019t necessarily replace the emotional relief of being legally divorced from a partner, but they can initiate a feeling of safety for both the woman and her child.\n\nMany times, people think they have to have all their ducks in a row before they leave (ie divorce filed, new job, childcare, etc.) but you do not! Your health and safety are more important than having everything figured out! Make a plan, call a friend or shelter, get your bags and go. The risk to your life and safety is absolutely more important to prioritize than the legal status of your marriage or the financial situation you are in (even if the latter feels incredibly important in the moment).",
         "This has been law in many states for decades. Nothing has changed in most cases. \n\nPlenty of people have explained why it is and it makes perfect sense. You\u2019re making a fuss about a totally normal thing (it\u2019s like this in my state, too, which is not in the US)"

She is now investigating Trump for his threats against Liz Cheney. In NC, the Republican chief justice won his seat by just 401 votes, after Republicans took over the court they issued an opinion in a voting rights case that led to the loss of three Democratic US congressional seats, maybe 4, depending on tomorrow. So EVERY VOTE COUNTS! And, if Trump passes a national abortion ban it won't matter if FL preserves a right to abortion because federal law overrides state law. There will be nowhere safe to go.

         "Your vote in the presidential election may not \"matter\" when it comes to the electoral college in a winner-take-all state but here's a few reasons it definitely makes an impact.\n\n1. A healthy, vocal minority has a moderating effect on the party in power - meaning their actions and agenda will align closer to the center in order to try and stay in power. See: Joe Manchin. \n2. Not voting because your state is \"safe\" will encourage the politicians to continue to believe that the state is less politically diverse than it actually is. The Democrats actually spent a lot more money in Texas than they normally do this year because of how many more people have voted blue in the last 10 years. The last time Ted Cruz was up for reelection, he only won by a very small margin. That let the Democrats know that they actually had a shot in Texas.\n\nAnd that's not even taking into account how important your votes down the ballot are. Local and state elections are very often won by extremely small margins and in many cases by less than 10 votes and those people have a lot more control over what your day-to-day life looks like than the president does.",

Exes that are trying to harass them. Abusive parents. Druggy  family members asking for money. Shit hole parents asking for money. Wondering whether or not they're going to off themselves. Dealing with family members who have offed themselves or got killed in a drug deal or died drunk next to a space heater. Quitting a job and moving because they couldn't afford to keep living in their apartment and got evicted because their partner left them stranded with 4 kids and lack of income.\n\nAnd all of that on top of trying to provide for their kids they already have or trying to prevent birthing kids from happening to them. While mostly also hearing the burden of caring for the men in their lives while also hearing the rest of the family burden. \n\nIf they can muster the strength then good for them. If not. Then don't blame them. I've seen one too many women break down because of life. I'm fortunate enough to not have had to live like those friends did and do.",

He wants other people to do the hard work, to make the hard decisions, and because he's a straight white man he thinks he'll probably be okay no matter what happens so he doesn't have to worry about it.\n\nWhat stuck with me is that his easygoing manner is actually kind of attractive, and he's not bad looking, so it wouldn't surprise me if he has an easy time meeting women.

         "I kindly disagree. The role of the Supreme Court and federal oversight is crucial in safeguarding fundamental rights for all Americans, regardless of state boundaries. Abortion is not merely a matter of personal choice or convenience\u2014it is a critical aspect of healthcare that ensures the health and well-being of pregnant women.\n\nWhen access to abortion is restricted, it disproportionately harms those in vulnerable situations, denying them critical, sometimes life-saving medical care. Leaving essential healthcare decisions to the discretion of individual states or communities risks creating inequitable access and can undermine the very concept of universal human rights.\n\nHealth care, including reproductive rights, should not be subject to the fluctuating opinions of the public or the political climate of individual states. It is the responsibility of the federal government to uphold these rights consistently across the nation, ensuring every individual has access to the care they need, regardless of where they live.\n\nTrue freedom of choice includes making decisions about your body and health without unnecessary government interference or local restrictions. Abortion rights are about protecting that fundamental freedom and ensuring that all women have equal access to essential healthcare services.",

         "Zero paid. So technically maternity leave is supposed to be supported under FMLA, which means that workers are entitled to take *unpaid* leave for up to 12 weeks and not lose their jobs. But an employer can still say they don\u2019t pay maternity leave at all, especially for places that are hourly. Unfortunately there\u2019s also plenty of employers who also won\u2019t even honor the protected leave aspect of it, where they will find a reason to terminate mothers who need to take time off work for a non-protected reason and a lot of times people just don\u2019t have the money/resources/time/know how to fight it. It\u2019s really, really terrible. Some companies are wonderful and offer it but they\u2019re few and far between. And they still want to force births on all of us even though people can\u2019t even take off a meager 4 weeks to give birth because of lack of savings/employment security/etc.. it\u2019s utterly awful!",

         "Does it matter all that much? You are incompatible with them. This is good to know.\n\nI'm sure some of them are struggling with thier own shame, or disagree and won't say it, or just think you're too political/too activist/whatever.\n\nBut I'm a woman who has also dated women, and I probably wouldn't date you either. I worked in non-profits and NGOs most of my life and I'd probably step away from dating someone with that dream as well. Hell, I'd donate, and I'd want to be your friend, but I wouldn't date someone with that passion. I know it's emotional toll, I know what that work entiails and I'd be very hesitant to enter into a long-term household/financial relationship with someone who had that very laudable goal, but one I couldn't make central to my own life. My emotional well isn't that deep. I stick to food security and arts access and even that freaking devastated me some days.\n\nI went on a date almost 12 years ago with a wonderful woman, whose dream was to leave the city and open an animal rescue and llama farm. It was a huge part of why we sort of fizzled out quickly between us. Now she has the llama farm and wife who loves that damn farm with her, and I visit twice a year and have a lovely time -- and then go back to the life I actually like in the city. No harm no foul.",
         "Many reasons. They might not be politically aligned with you, they might want to date someone with finance/career aspirations more like their own, or they might have experience with the shelter system or domestic violence or sex work or the \u201cnonprofit industrial complex\u201d and want to stay away from that whole sphere.\n\n(Personally, even though I think this is an admirable goal, I would not want a serious relationship with someone who\u2019s trying to start a new nonprofit because I have experience working in that sector and know it to be emotionally exhausting, badly paid, and leading to a lot of cynicism and burnout.)",
         "It is a good cause no doubt, but this type of projects consume a lot of time, physical and mental energy. The people I have met that do stuff like this have their whole life revolving around it.\u00a0\n\nTo turn it around would you be thrilled with a guy making it clear his biggest dream is to work on his own startup 24/7, and on top of that the idea is not to make much money, if anything at all.

Because you need someone who is excited to be with a strong, passionate woman, and they are not that person.",
         "I'll be honest - my spouse was employed with a housing assistance program, and it caused burnout. In both of us. \n\nThey were dealing with so many people in crisis, many of which should not have been left on their own but there was nothing my partner could do about the mental health or executive functioning help the clients needed besides providing and making the initial call to resources. Many of them were, understandably, angry about their situations. Many of them would take their frustrations on out my partner, who was also getting paid barely above minimum wage and had their own troubles. There was no escape, because their supervisor would tell my partner to \"give them grace\" and would only intervene if violence was threatened.\n\nAnd they would come home. And I would ask them to unload it to share the burden.\n\nWe couldn't keep this up for 3 months before shit hit the fan. I felt neglected and dreading seeing my partner some days, and I felt terrible about it. My partner felt dead inside and it reached their eyes.\n\nAs much as I respect the people who can and do have the resources to make a difference in starting up and working these programs, I could not see myself dating someone in that position again without assurance from them that they are on top of caring for their own mental health AND we would get at least one decent date day a week.\n\nDoes that mean all of these men have the same reasoning? No. But I do want to acknowledge that there can be deep, personal reasons why someone would not be compatible with your vision without being a complete asshole.",

         "People are listing very valid possible options in the comments. But it could also simply be that these men don't want someone who is going to be running a non-profit of any kind. If the relationship becomes a long-term, serious commitment, a partner whose career is in the non-profit industry is not going to be contributing financially to a significant degree. They may wish for a partner who is on more equal footing with a traditional career.\n\nI personally probably would not date a man whose career is in non-profit or intends to go that way. In this economy, I'm not interested in having to financially support someone who is able to have a reasonably fruitful career that's at least equal to mine but won't (as admiral as the choice is in this case). I would like to be able to own a home one day. I can do so alone and intend to for my first one, but with a partner who can contribute at least roughly what I can, we can afford something a bit better eventually",

Maybe it's one less check mark in the \"interests we share\" column, or maybe they're annoyed that you have \\*any\\* passion outside them.\n\nMaybe they're one of those misogynists who consider all women's issues to be automatically un-serious, as if you'd said you want to dedicate your life to ancient aliens or proving that Jesus used marijuana.\n\nMaybe they hear it as \"this woman will never make very much money.\" They can't mooch off of you, perhaps, or you're not as \"high value\" \\[rolls eyes\\] as them or that you don't have career goals in common.\n\nMaybe some of them have really good, very personal reasons related to this issue-- though it seems really unlikely that this would be so common that OP would notice a strong pattern.\n\nMy guess is that the reasons are \"all of the above,\" ranging from person to person but most knee-jerk reactors probably couldn't articulate it to themselves beyond \"ew.\"\n\nNot that any of that matters b/c a \"no\" is a \"no,\" but one does wonder.",

         "I'm not gonna try to answer why they lose interest because, honestly, I think those are awesome things to want to do. \n\nWhat I will say is this: You deserve someone who believes not just in you but in these dreams also. If they don't then it's no big loss for you. \n\nI wish you the best in your dreams and hope you're able to help many people who need it.",
         "You'll attract the right friends who support this long-term outreach that will be an ongoing process. If you had a cat or a dog, you would cause some people to back off. If you were a police officer or a minister, you would need a spouse who accommodated that. This is normal. Musicians who tour need partners who support their careers. Actors often marry other actors and sometimes that works and other times it fails. The right partner and friends will support you through ups and downs, for better or worse. Anyone else will get out of your way to make room for the right people to enter your life and focus on. \n\nBest wishes and let me know how I can help you set up sustainable revenue. I strongly recommend the revenue model taught by real estate investor groups like Kaylee McMahon The Apartment Queen  program, and the ladies at equity academy.

I think they believe 'a lot' of women lie about DV, and due to sexism and real life experiences, they don't take real women's accounts of abuse as credible, and the idea of you working to help 'those people' highlights the differences between the two of you.

Are you aware of how unbelievably complex it is? \n\nAlso, I\u2019m willing to bet it is often assumed you\u2019re a survivor. Very, VERY few guys are willing to handle that. It will upset people that you\u2019re a walking reminder of how awful the world is. Also, you don\u2019t mention actually having volunteered with DV organizations yet. It is not a normal thing for a 17 year old to want to do and men may be making assumptions about your childhood and parents. \n\nFinally, you\u2019ll never make money doing this. Certainly not the kind of money you need to survive. Do not EVER set yourself up to live a life where you may become financially dependent on a man. You need to figure out how you\u2019re going to afford to live alone while doing this. \n\nUse your passion to volunteer. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that. Of all the life causes to choose, you\u2019ve picked an extremely dark one. \n\nI say all of this as a survivor. I have personally traumatized well trained, specialized therapists by telling my story. I know because they told me after I completed the program and it didn\u2019t upset me to learn, I felt empathy for them. Compassion fatigue is real and there\u2019s only so much a person can take. That\u2019s why I\u2019m saying that it\u2019s naive to make it your life mission. DV will never stop. It will never get easier. You can help victims but you can\u2019t prevent new ones being made. It. Will. Eat. You. Alive.",
         "- they feel guilty\n- they feel like it wouldn't serve their interests\n- they realize they probably can't easily manipulate you\n- they don't think SWers have any worth (also points 1, 2)\n- they don't like the idea of a woman with her own goals and ambitions \n\nRegardless of which of the above causes it its probably good to find out sooner than later..\n\nSide note: Best of luck getting the organization organized and the victims helped!",
         "Passion jobs like running a DV shelter suck the soul out of people who go into them wanting to help people and spend their days filling out bureaucratic forms and fighting the city zoning board.  It's really hard to be the partner of someone coming to grips with that. (Source: my dad followed his soul, and my mom occasionally slipped up and mentioned that she regretted marrying him.) \n\n\nSocial services sector jobs are notoriously underpaid relative to the level of education needed to get them.  A friend of mine was a social worker in Chicago, and quit to be a high end restaurant server, because it was far more money, far less stress, and no nightmares. And that was a government job with nice benefits.  What you are talking about will be unlikely to have even that much financial cushion; you'll probably have a hard time just making the payments on your student loans.  (Money isn't everything, but lack of money kills more relationships than anything else.) \n\n\n(Side note: are you doing well enough in your studies that you'd be accepted into a Master of Social Work graduate program? That's pretty much the cutoff for getting a meaningful position in that field.) \n\n\nIn addition to all of that, while wanting to help sex workers and domestic violence victims is certainly a laudable goal, people who are drawn to any kind of work helping the disadvantaged are, to be blunt, often not much fun to be around.  Not everyone wants to be constantly reminded of inequities in society. \n\n\nAnd then above and beyond all that, you want to help victims of gender and sexual violence.  That just adds another layer on top of enough deal breakers for most people. \n\n\nSuggestion: try meeting people who work for other nonprofits, both to date and to network with.  \n\n\nSuggestion 2: Find organizations already doing this kind of work, and spend 20 hours a week volunteering, which should eventually get you a trust level to see what goes on under the surface.  Maybe this will ignite your passion, maybe it will dampen it, but you'll have a better grounding to plan your future. \n\n\n(And if you can't see putting in 20 hours a week just to test out how you feel about this path in life, then it's probably not for you -- running a shelter isn't a 40 hour workweek, it's going to be 60 or 70.)",

Please vote.",

         "I\u2019m trying not to get too excited this year, because I was so excited in 2016 and I have some sort of mild trauma from that election.",
         "I know no one here has to hear this, but it bears repeating.\n\nAre you in a swing state? VOTE! No excuses! Trump is winning in Pennsylvania. Come on PA!\n\nAre you in a state where you already know which candidate will win? VOTE ANYWAY! There's important stuff going on down-ballot. Florida is going to go massively for the Orange POS, but there's a women's rights issue on the ballot. I'm in a state that is certain to go for Harris. But we're choosing a US Senator, and I don't want Steve Garvey. Every House member is up for re-election. If you don't vote we don't flip! School boards--there are insane MAGAs trying to take over the schools, in every state. \n\nIf you haven't voted, VOTE! And vote the entire ballot!",
         "Already done. Waiting nervously for the outcome, wishing it was more obvious who will come out on top.",
         "I'm the only woman in my department. I have been very anxious today. I'm hoping for the best but I'm scared, honestly.",
         "Yes! \n\nAnd as a total side note as a \"forgotten\" Gen-X'er it'll be our first Gen-X president (arguably, some demographers put 1964\u2014her birth year\u2014with Gen-X, some put it late-late-late Boomer). \n\nVOTE VOTE VOTE \n\nOh here are the generations:\n\nInterbellum Generation: \n\n    Lyndon B. Johnson \n    Richard Nixon\n    Gerald Ford\n    Ronald Reagan\n\nGG (\"Greatest Generation\"):\n\n    George H.W. Bush\n\nSilent Generation:\n\n    Joe Biden\n\nBoomers:\n\n    Bill Clinton\n    George W. Bush\n    Barack Obama \n    Donald Trump\n\nGen-X:\n\n    Kamala Harris\n\nPLEASE VOTE!!!",
         "I\u2019m 6 months too young to vote for her. But everyone else in my home has voted blue!",
         "I did have the thought that if Trump wins and I never get to vote again, I\u2019m really happy that the last vote I\u2019ll ever cast is for a Black woman.",
         "I'm voting tomorrow and already feeling emotional. If this happens, I am definitely crying. But like happy crying. If the other thing happens, I'll probably cry and then rage.",
         "Canadian here. I\u2019m biting my nails off with anxiety.",
         "I'm super nervous about what a Trump win will mean for the world, and I don't even live in the USA. Can't imagine how a lot of American women are feeling right now. Solidarity with my sisters across the pond!",
         "I'm trying to ignore it, while trying to be comforting to the kids (apparently the other kids are talking about it at school) and my spouse. Everyone seems disheartened because of what everyone and everything that is being said. I just want some peace and some sort of normal. It's so hard to be hopeful when you see other people say some of the most vile nonsense.\n\n\nEdit: Just going to say we early voted already. So we are just trying to be supportive of others heading to the polls without losing our sanity and humanity.",
         "I was just talking to my friend about this last night. We *are* going to elect the first female president EVER!! I voted and I\u2019m hopeful and I\u2019m confident. And when it happens I\u2019ll be so proud as a woman and proud of American women around the country who are sick of the pile of burning garbage that is the GOP.",
         "I actually like the fact that the whole woman president thing is not front and center here. It\u2019s even bigger than that. We need her to save our rights as women and how fitting she happens to be a woman.",
         "I'm going to hold on to that. \nI got laughed at today when I said I had anxiety about the election and if Trump gets elected again I'll probably have a mental breakdown. \n\nI might take the week off.",
         "I have a picture of me and my daughter (then a tween) after I voted for Hillary. \n\nI'm wearing an \"I voted\"  sticker and she's wearing a \"future voter\" sticker and we both look happy and excited. \ud83d\ude0a\n\nWhen I took it I thought I had just voted for the first female president and I was so proud to have shared that with my daughter. \ud83d\udc97\n\nNow when I look at that picture I see a picture of someone whose world view was about to be shattered, like the glass ceiling that was supposed to have been smashed that night. \ud83d\udc94\n\nI no longer have faith that the American voters would never actually elect someone like Donald Trump. \ud83d\udc94\n\nI no longer have faith that the majority of Americans would give selflessly for a greater cause, like we did during WWII and the civil rights era. \ud83d\udc94\n\nI no longer have faith that the people in power would protect the regulations that gave us our clean air and water. \ud83d\udc94\n\nI no longer have faith that our National Parks are beyond the reach of greedy developers. \ud83d\udc94\n\nI no longer have faith that it would *never* happen that our elected officials would vote \"no\" on something that helps people *just because* someone from a different party came up with it. After all, that would be like cutting off your nose to spite your face! \ud83d\udc94\n\nTomorrow I will again vote for the person I hope will become our first female president. But my happiness and excitement will be tainted by an understanding that this isn't the United States that we were before Donald Trump and we will never be that United States again.",
         "The fact that we're not making a big deal of it is a sign that America is ready for a female president.",
         "Part of me wants to intentionally play up the doom and gloom in the hopes it gets people out to vote.\n\nBut if you haven't been convinced at this point, I don't know what it takes. If I knew absolutely nothing else about the man, him being a rapist bars him from my vote for eternity.\n\nAnd the fact that a smart and capable person is his opponent, yet the polls are roughly tied boggles my mind.\n\nI'd like to be clear, this is not a lesser of two evils vote: it is a clear decision between fascism and democracy. Harris doesn't excite me, but she definitely is someone I would like to vote for, rather than explicitly against her opponent. It just so happens that I'm doing both this time.",
         "I am getting up early to vote before work in the morning.  \n\nAfter I vote, I will keep off social media and keep election coverage turned off.  I do not trust polls and the election day coverage is all supposition based on sample sizes that are statistically too small to be any kind of accurate.  I absolutely hate it when they start making predictions with only 2% of precincts reporting and polls still open for several hours!\n\nI do not care how anybody votes, just that they do!  This is your chance to participate in the process try to affect change.  I am so thankful that > 100 years ago, women rallied in this country and won the right to vote and I appreciate my opportunity to do so.",
         "We had that chance 8 years ago and blew it.\n\nLet's not make that same mistake again.",
         "54 yr old. white male.  Voting for Harris;  For my three sisters, all brilliant and dedicated in their fields and all fierce and proud feminists, for my six aunts, for my cousins and niece.  For my mother, passed away in 2017, who taught me what equality for all people really means.\n\nFor girlfriends past, for the women I work with, for the women who taught me in every school I ever attended, for the women who doctored and nursed me back to health, for every woman who has ever been first to set foot in a realm of men and excel.\n\nFor my wife, who by herself raised a son who lives and breathes equality for all.\n\nFor every woman who's life has hung in the balance because some man wants to beat her over the head with his fucking holy book. \n\nIt's long overdue time to show the TruckNutz & Bibles crowd the door.",
         "First \u201cwoman of color\u201d in the position too. Check off two boxes in one go.",
         "I also want to alert everyone to pay attention to what the polls are saying today vs what the outcome is. Remember which ones were accurate and which ones were bullshit. It\u2019s only going to get worse from here regarding manipulation and misinformation.\n\nIf (when) Trump loses, the next R candidate will have all of his (lack of) values and policies without his batshit insanity, and they will talk very pretty while taking away a LOT of people\u2019s rights. We\u2019ll cross that bridge when we come to it, but we have to stay vigilant.\n\nAlso, it\u2019s definitely lost in the fray that Kamala is more than likely going to be the first woman president, and that was on purpose. Learning from the mistakes of the Hillary campaign (which weren\u2019t their fault, people are just incredibly stupid). It\u2019s definitely exciting from a historical standpoint though!",
         "I already shot my shot early. Here's hoping.\n\n\nI've been saying for years that the first woman elected president would be a psycho like MTG. I am going to be so very happy if I'm wrong.\u00a0",
         "I took the next two days off\n\nI\u2019ll be snacking and drinking and anxiously watching the news.",
         "I don't know what's going to happen tomorrow. Hopefully Kamala Harris wins in a landslide and there is nothing they can do to reverse it, no matter how many lawsuits or tricks they pull. Women's rights are at stake, and human rights as a whole are right behind them.\n\nBut no matter what happens tomorrow, never relent. Never give up. Never give in. Be the most annoying little thorn in their side. We owe it to those who came before us who believed in human rights and decency. They weren't always perfect, but they paved the way so that people like us could band together and maintain those rights. We also owe it to the people who will come after us. They deserve to be able to choose what happens to their body. They deserve to marry the person they fall in love with. They deserve to be treated as equals. Most importantly, we owe it to ourselves and others who may not be completely lost. Of course, the people who fall in line with us are a given. What we do now affects us directly. As for those who are not completely lost, a lot of young women and women in general are indoctrinated and vote against their own self interest. The young ones can still be saved. Even the older ones can still be saved. It's not fair, and it really shouldn't be up to us. The one and only reason I know they can be saved is because I used to be among them. Although I am a man, I was indoctrinated by religion. Eventually, I saw the light and the veil lifted. The greatest thing I have ever done was to vote for Barack Obama. The second greatest thing I have done is to vote for Kamala Harris. Empathy, sympathy and human decency are on the line.\n\nAnd while it is probably clich\u00e9 to say this because it's part of a song:\n\nThrough the fire and the flames, we carry on.",
         "I\u2019m doing my part in PA tomorrow!! \ud83d\udc99 My husband, mom, grandmother, FIL, MIL, SIL, BIL, 2 aunts/uncles, and a bunch of cousins, all in PA, have already voted blue by mail-in! \ud83c\udf0a\n\nThankfully I know more people voting D than R, but the ones that hurt the most are my dad, stepmom, and 19yo brother. I thought college would help him to see outside of our dad\u2019s red bubble, but I\u2019m worried it didn\u2019t.",
         "Not a woman, but I\u2019m scared that if Trump wins we\u2019re fucked",

         "Those of us in the rest of the world are rooting for you too",
         "I feel it too.  This is an intensely stress election.  I voted on Saturday at the last early voting.  It was a little encouraging to see quite a few young people participating.  I don't know what I will do if she loses.  I might lose my mind.",
         "I am not a citizen but a male feminist and Im honestly looking forward to this. In my life, many women have had a wonderful influence. I hope the world becomes less misogynistic.",
         "I hope VP Harris gets elected.  We have never had the experience of a female President of the United States.  I think a woman has so much to offer.  Think about how effective most women are at running households and businesses.  Their ability to multi-task, their ability to pull everything together all the time, their ability to bring disagreements to the table and get it figured out and move forward... I think the future with a woman President will be amazing to watch unfold and who knows, we may never go back to a man in that position.",
         "[removed]",
         "One of the things I love about Kamala is that she isn't banking on her gender. I don't recall her ever touting the fact that she's a woman, which is much, much different than how Hillary Clinton ran her campaign. Kamala is running on policy and the future of the United States, not on making history. She's already the first woman VP, breaking that glass ceiling to become the first woman President would be the icing on the very delicious cake. I voted for her and I hope enough of us did to make her President.",
         "I think we\u2019re just afraid to get our hopes up. I know I am. I will be excited and celebrate when she actually wins.",
         "I got to vote for three women on my ballot: president, senator, and representative.  Maryland doesn't usually play a big role in national level politics, but the Senate race is actually important this time.",
         "The fact that she's female isn't the primary attribute that makes me vote for her, but it is historic nonetheless.",
         "Have been watching closely from Canada and hope to the high heavens that you guys can pull this one off!!",
         "Not American here. I hope everything goes well tomorrow (and by \"well\" I mean not Trump becoming president again).",

         "When will we find out who\u2019s elected; for context in in the uk. Do you hear morning of tomorrow or much later?",
         "I think that we need to focus not on the fact that the best candidate for the Presidency is female, black, and Asian-American, but rather that the best candidate for the Presidency is all of that **AND SANE**. \n\nI think Hilary relied too much on the \"I'm a woman, and it's time a woman was President\" lean, which opened the doors to the problem we have now. I like that Harris hasn't been throwing it in our faces that she's a woman. The GOP have done that enough that it's refreshing to see Harris basically \"yeah, and?\" the whole thing. \n\nI truly 100% hope she wins tomorrow. Not just because she's a woman. But because she'll give hope to ALL women that their lives aren't something to be ruled over or even cast aside at the whims of others. It'll send a strong message to future leaders of our country that it doesn't matter if you're male or female, black or white, a parent or not, you CAN lead this country and you SHOULD if you have the best plan for fixing what's wrong. \n\nUnfortunately there are just way too many people clinging to the edifice of old that would rather die than admit defeat. Hopefully that era comes to an end tomorrow and we can finally move forward and heal this broken country.",

Hilary Clinton while qualified had a rather long run in the public eye to have shit thrown at her. Kamala Harris hasn't had the same run in the public eye, at least not nationally. I also want to point out that Harris cannot get tagged with the discussions of how she moved states to run for office. Harris is also carrying far less baggage (for lack of any better terms) than Clinton did going into the election.\n\nThis election is different as there are less people that don't care about this election versus 2016 when people honestly saw things as \"Were getting completely screwed either way, so it doesn't matter\". Also there isn't the youth vote ready to jump ship after the candidate they truly supported being denied the nomination. Harris has also directly appealed to them, my students all elementary level have been quoting the Maya Rudolph skits along with older kids than I know.",

Sure, it looks great for them now, when it looks like they\u2019re getting free assistance and cover from the Federalist Society and Fox News and Elon Musk and the Heritage Foundation\u2026but the more fundamental truth is that the *Republican Party* is the tool being used here, and once all the contradictory forces pulling in their direction stop having Trump to unify on, they\u2019re fucked. Our political system is basically inevitably two-party, so any more than two parties is academic, but I think if we broke the status quo entirely and had to reassemble \u201cpolitical parties\u201d from the strewn about infrastructure, we could build at least four parties from the Democratic Party that would best whatever got built from the Republican pieces and parts.",

It was the most moronic thing I've ever seen in my life.\n\nEventually, I challenged the FO and said the following (more or less): (Warning: Sweary Language)\n\nOK, Let's say we get a volunteer on the first call (which we fucking won't, but whatever). It will take that person a half hour to get here. Then 15 minutes minimum to train them to knock on doors. Then 30 minutes minimum for the recruited canvasser to get out into the field. Then at least 15 minutes to figure out what the fuck they are doing with the app. Which means, the earliest door knock of a hypothetical volunteer (who we don't even know to exist yet) is 90 minutes before the polls close. And since voters will take at least 30 minutes to get to the polls because it's rush hour, they probably don't know where the fuck they are supposed to vote and they aren't waiting by the door with their shoes on, that means that at most, our hypothetical volunteer could knock on 10-12 hypothetical doors before it's too late. Wouldn't it be better, instead to give the volunteers that we do have tier 1 calling lists so they can make \\~75 real calls over the next 2.5 hours.\n\nThe answer I got was \"We don't have any tier one phone lists cut anyway. All we have are vol recruitment lists which are mostly made up of people who already voted.\"\n\nI just told the volunteers with laptops to log into hillary's virtual dialer or whatever and pick a state to start calling.

Add to that the repeal of Roe and Trump\u2019s crudeness, and they are pretty motivated.  And they are a group that has personal stories of getting fired for being pregnant, and some pretty horrific birthing stories.",

         "Also as part of that poll is independents breaking towards Harris significantly, both women and men but especially women. As one of those independent women in Iowa who voted for Harris, I\u2019m not surprised. Also it\u2019s only been recently that Iowa voted red. They voted for the Democratic candidate for president from \u201888-2000 and 2008-2012. The split between registered republicans/independents/democrats is all pretty even at 1/3 for all. Basically the independents drive the winning vote, and there\u2019s enough to be pissed off at to be motivated to get out the vote for the Democrats. And Iowa is about 87% white too. \n\nTheres also a very good chance Iowa flips 2 US House seats to democrats, which we need to pass rights to abortion at the federal level ( among other things).",

Other women in her demographic may be more likely to skip voting or vote Harris.

She\u2019s been volunteering at her polling site for years (she\u2019s the coordinator this year!), and she said she does it largely to allay election anxiety because she\u2019s just so busy that she doesn\u2019t have time to think about it. I was like, girl, that\u2019s genius. She lives in a district in a city with a lot of unhoused people so she gets a fair number of in person voters. Her husband is also volunteering this year and got assigned to her site so he can\u2019t wait to see her do her thing (and is happy to be bossed around by the lady he loves).",

My dad was conservative so I think she kind of went along with him to keep the peace and because she really didn\u2019t care that much.  \nNow she cares.

I'm just keeping my fingers crossed that there are a lot of people who are fed up with trump and fed up with having to fight for rights that had already been won.",

And even more did in 2020.\n\nThe party has been purged of all but sycophants at this point. Even casuals see it. It's a clownshow. A dangerous one, which is part of the abusive components of autocracy (i.e. the pain of watching worthless scumbags degrade fellow citizens & institutions), but perhaps the only talent & base remaining in the GOP being simpering little sadists will be repulsive enough that Iowa old-school conservatives vote Harris or sit it out.",
         "I sure as hell hope, it would be incredible to see Harris become the first female President in US history, and it would be utterly symbolic for her to defeat a man who pretty much represents everything bad about the patriarchy.",

We\u2019re already at 44% turnout (3.2 million votes) based on absentee ballots and in-person early voting as of Monday morning, with a few hundred thousand remaining absentee ballots that can be turned in until 8 PM tomorrow. \n\n2020 saw 5.6 million votes and 71% turnout, and this election looks like it could match or beat 2020. Detroit also started counting absentee ballots early, so there shouldn\u2019t be as much of a delay in vote counting, especially since fewer people voted absentee this year.",
         "So is GR, I think.",
         "At least I\u2019ve gotten about three hours a night.  I\u2019m still kind of a wreck.\n\nThe stakes have never been higher.  And we STILL have to navigate through the conspiracy of insurrectionist fuckery until the actual Inauguration.\n\nFingers crossed for our democracy",
         "I put my ballot into a drop box instead of mailing it specifically because I didn\u2019t want to risk USPS even with multiple weeks until the election. My city\u2019s drop box is in front of city hall and within easy walking distance of my apartment, so it wasn\u2019t even an inconvenience. It was marked received the next day, so I\u2019m glad I did.",
         "This is me too\u2014while I\u2019m registered independent I\u2019ve always leaned democratic/left due to social issues but get along with the conservative \u201cReagan republicans\u201d too (which is a lot of my immediate family). I have occasionally voted for Republican. I like to say my philosophy is \u201cmind your shit but don\u2019t be an asshole.\u201d This Christian nationalist and not really fiscally conservative Republican Party that has abandoned all principles to follow this wannabe dictator no matter what he does is far from anything I recognize as Conservative or even American. It must be purged.",
         "Sadly, Warren (3rd largest city in Michigan) will cause a delay because they've opted out of counting their 20,000 mail in ballots early.",

One of my social circles recently discovered that, years ago, a prominent member of our local religious community had inappropriately touched his own child. He's already been locked up for almost two years, but his actual sentencing hearing wasn't until last month. We found out *on* the day of the hearing what the date of the hearing was. A bunch of us women rallied via group chat, and myself and one of the other women were able to knock off work last minute -- literally with only 90 minutes of notice -- to attend the hearing.\n\nI arrived at the courthouse a few minutes before she did. Once she arrived, we linked arms, and walked into the courtroom, only to discover that we were the *only* people there on behalf of the victim. Everyone else in attendance -- well over a dozen people -- were there on behalf of him. I was horrified. They even testified on his behalf, and spoke about his 'great character', and what a positive 'role model' he was for them. Some of them even asked the judge to consider \"all the good\" in him. \n\nMandatory minimum called for 15 years. Prosecution asked for 28 years. Judge sentenced him to 23 years. He'll remain locked away for a long, long time. Although it was just myself and that one other woman in attendance on behalf of the victim, it felt empowering to rally and ensure justice was served, especially so last minute.",

      "text": "I'm a 27F and I've been married to my husband for over five years now. Over the last six months we've be discussing the idea of having a child. The other day we had a more serious conversation where we both decided that we wanted to start trying within the next year, since we both have stable jobs and a home and we feel like we're just about ready for the next step in our lives. \n\nHowever, we both agreed if Trump is elected president we will NOT have children. It's too scary. We live in a fairly blue state, but I'm terrified of a national abortion ban. What if I have complications? I'm not ready to die trying to bring a baby into this world, and my husband doesn't want to risk my life. I know the chances of death are slim, but they are not non-existent. I also have a health condition that raises the chances of preeclampsia, having a child small for gestational age, or having a stillborn. So I already have elevated risks of complications. \n\nAm I overreacting? Does anyone else feel similarly?  It's ridiculous that I feel like I have to base this personal decision around who is elected president, but it's the world we live in. Even in my blue state I wonder if my rights will be safe in a year. Since election day is tomorrow, this has been weighing heavily on me and I just needed a space to talk about it.",

         "You are definitely not overreacting. As a fellow woman who will likely face issues with childbirth due to various lifelong conditions that raise chances of complications and miscarriage. I 100% agree with you that if trump is elected that pregnancy will become way to dangerous in the United States. I mean because of him and the people he elected it is already too dangerous and there isn't an all out ban set everywhere yet. I mean an 18 year old girl recently died in Texas, she wasn't even looking for an abortion. She had recently had a gender reveal party. She just faced a miscarriage and complications but the doctors refused to help when she came in septic until they carried out TWO separate ultrasounds to make sure the fetus/baby was not viable/alive anymore.  And as such would not give her lifesaving treatment. Only after the two ultrasounds did they move her to icu where she died later. \n\nSo no, you are most definitely not overreacting. \nEven women in other countries have sworn to not travel to America if they are remotely suspecting they may be pregnant. Me included.\n\n(Edit to add the word not before overreacting in the last part of my comment)",
         "Unfortunately, not overreacting. I've lost five very wanted pregnancies and although we were lucky to not have complications, when there is an emergency, it happens fast. There is not time to get yourself across the border, unless you're lucky enough to live right next to it, and even then, that's a gamble. Thousands of birthing people will die under Trump every year if he is elected. Ultimately, I think that's their goal. Women who are scared, sick, and dying don't wield a lot of political power. Giving birth in the United States is already more dangerous than in most developed nations, and under Trump's abortion bans, no state will be safe. It's a very sad, infuriating, and just fucked up situation and I'm sorry you're needing to make decisions within it. Let's hope tomorrow brings some better news!",
         "I agree completely. Women are dying because their doctors are unable to care for them. I was a labor nurse for years and now am a postpartum nurse, and women\u2019s health is a huge passion of mine. I want children soon, and I want a daughter more than anything in the world, but I won\u2019t bring her into a world where her rights will be diminished because of her gender. I\u2019m getting up early tomorrow morning and voting in person for Harris in my \u201cthe future is female\u201d tee!",
         "You should be scared. I\u2019m scared. \u00a0\n\nI am currently recovering from a miscarriage. Like all my previous miscarriages, I hemorrhaged terribly and lost a shit ton of blood. When nurses and doctors are visibly freaked out by the amount of bleeding, that\u2019s when you know it\u2019s bad. \u00a0\n\nMy severe, life-threatening bleeding was slowed by a vacuum aspiration procedure. Essentially, the uterus keeps contracting as long as there is tissue in the uterus, which is bad if you are bleeding uncontrollably. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhat I had is considered an abortion procedure. The same procedure that is banned or very very hard to get in many US states. In fact, in many of these states I would have been denied care at the ER at all, even as I was bleeding out. I would have been told, as many women in similar positions have, to wait until my condition worsens. Sometimes, these women are actively miscarrying in their cars parked outside so they are close enough to get care when they are finally half-dead.\u00a0\n\nYou should be scared. We should all be scared. If Trump gets elected, considering my condition, I am not having any more babies for at least four more years because I could FUCKING DIE. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nLast bit: in some cases, I could have even faced criminal charges for having a miscarriage. There is no medical indication whether a miscarriage is random or intentional. None. They have no way of knowing. So just keep that in mind too.\u00a0",
         "I was 25 when Trump got elected in 2016. I\u2019d been on the fence about kids, but watching him get elected that night 100% solidified my decision not to have kids. I don\u2019t think people understand how bad the country is ALREADY fucked from his first presidency. Things are never going to be the same as they were pre-Trump, it can\u2019t bounce back. Like we can nominate Democrats for the next 50 years and I intend to vote for every one of them, but the Supreme Court isn\u2019t going anywhere and what the Republican party turned into, who they showed themselves to be, can not be reversed. \n\nSo I get it, because I felt that way in 2016 and I still feel that way, this is not a country I can ever feel good about bringing kids into.",

My husband managed to get me to the hospital in around twenty minutes, and in that time my blood had soaked through a huge pad, two full size beach towels, and was pooling on the car floor and leather seat. I could feel myself getting colder and weaker with every heartbeat, and it was so scary to think my toddler could end up facing life without me. \n\nMy life was saved by an emergency D&C, aka an abortion. \n\nI\u2019ve had folks suggest that I could have simply driven to a state where abortion is legal, had this happened after Roe was overturned. I live over two hours from any other state, and I almost didn\u2019t survive the twenty minute race to the closest hospital. If I had needed to wait for paperwork and red tape, I would be dead. \n\nWhat is happening with women\u2019s healthcare in the United States is barbaric and inhumane.

Or would she die from sepsis.  I worry now for my children and grandchildren.  It's such a scary time.  And I really can't believe that some people are so ignorant that they support his policies.

         "As a non-American I can only say what you are potentially facing in this election is truly horrifying.  You are absolutely not overreacting.\n\nPregnancy can and does kill women.  Access to appropriate healthcare is what saves their lives.  It\u2019s completely rational to not want to take the risk of pregnancy when there is a non-zero chance you could have complications for which you might be denied said life saving healthcare.\n\nI\u2019m hoping sanity rules in your country for the election.  Harris appears capable, competent and strong.  I hope that\u2019s as clear to the majority of voters in your country as it is to those of us on the outside looking in.",
         "I'm not saying this to scare you, but I am sharing this for women in this sub that were leaning towards voting Trump.\n\nTwo things are going to happen under him, and this is realistic, because it's already in progress judicially at state government levels. The Trump admin will use the Comstock act to ban the mailing of mifepristone in the United States but also from international locations; it would be illegal and seized. My state of Tennessee has been exploring avenues to ban mifepristone being sent in the mail, so this is a Republican initiative. \n\nTrump has talked about who he will appoint and he has plans to appoint someone that not only guts the FDA, but that could successfully make mifepristone illegal to be used for abortions. This would effectively make medical abortion unobtainable in every state. \n\nBetween these two routes, abortion will basically be illegal federally - without ever having had to sign a bill. So even though Trump said he wouldn't sign a bill, that doesn't matter and was likely never the goal.\n\nNo state will be safe and even if a state has abortion constitutionally enshrined, if mifepristone is illegal to be mailed or to be used for abortion, medical abortion will not be obtainable anywhere, only surgical abortion, which severely limits protected states to offer the procedure in a timely manner. This means women who should have had access to an abortion in the first trimester won't have it because of wait times at the very small amount of clinics that even still offer abortion.\n\nThis isn't even taking into consideration miscarriage care if fetal tissue is retained and there's no access to mifepristone. If abortion is not accessible, a retained miscarriage would result in sepsis. Sepsis leads to severe injury and death.\n\nI'm not fear mongering, I'm telling you in stark reality what the future will look like. Vote responsibily and accordingly.",

         "No you are not overreacting. I was 7 weeks pregnant when Roe fell and my state immediately implemented a trigger law from the 1800s before they voted to ban abortion almost entirely. I ended up having complications that put my pregnancy in the high risk category right when my state banned abortion. Thankfully I made it to 40 weeks and my son is healthy, but I cannot go through that stress again so he will not have a sibling.",

         "26F here- I'm already iffy about having kids, but it's an absolute no for me under any Republican government. I live in a red state and really can't risk it.\n\nMy main concern at this point is birth control access. I'm not sexually active, but my birth control is life-saving care due to my terrible hormonal mood swings and PMDD. It does more for my mental health than my other antidepressants, and without it, I don't think I'll make it.\n\nI don't think it's overreacting, as these are big health events and decisions that we don't have full control over because of our government. I'm recalling some conversation I saw online (so please call me out if this is misinformation!) that a Republican supermajority would be able to put through a national ban that would supersede a state's own laws. If abortions become illegal federally, it would become harder or impossible for blue states to remain safe havens for reproductive care.\n\nYour concerns are much more pressing because you're actively wanting to have children, and I'd fully agree with your decision to not have them under Trump. For my own personal life, I'm also terrified because abortion bans turn into other reproductive health bans. And if I can't get my birth control for hormonal therapy reasons, I'm toast.\n\nA Harris victory is a victory for reproductive care of all kinds. Here's hoping America shows up tomorrow.",

The link to the 200 page filing is in the article. For the nationalists, it's at least partially about 'replacement theory'. ( ie, not enough white babies and too many non-white babies) It's ugly stuff that they've been pushing for decades (also used as justification in mid-century Germany).\n\nIt's about punishing women. They've spent billions and decades framing abortion as 'birth control for loose women'. They believe it's their religious duty to force you to follow their religious beliefs, even if it kills you.",

A lot of the war on women has depended on republican-leaning voters saying they won\u2019t do things they tried to do (repeal the ACA) or did (Dobbs), or rationalizing that it won\u2019t affect them (thinking of that horror story with that woman in Texas who self-described as an abortion opponent).

And they get some kind of $1000/mo kid bonus thing ot help with expenses.  And, socieity over there is less hardcore hustle oriented.

The only way to really do a national ban is an Amendment, and there's nowhere near the number or math for that.\n\nAll of that optimism aside, here are headlines that make us all shudder,  make us all angry.

         "You\u2019re not overreacting. Having children nowadays is heavy K-selection, meaning people have 1-2 kids that are well taken care of, and when something threatens their health, it\u2019s normal to be scared. I know several families that have moved to Europe after having their only child later in life because of the risk random public/school shootings that doesn\u2019t seem to be going away anytime soon.",
         "Texan here. All talk of having children have stopped until we move or if women\u2019s rights are restored. You\u2019re not overreacting. It could get real real bad for the whole country. Ps everyone pls vote.",
         "When I was 17, the ARNP said the most dangerous thing a woman can do is give birth. I\u2019ve almost died 5 times in my life. Four times were because I was pregnant. I will never get pregnant again.\n\nThis is my 3rd time watching this man run for president while I hold an infant and think wtf.",
         "No, you're not overreacting. Having children is a serious decision that every couple has to make for themselves. I like kids but decided years ago to be childfree for a lot of reasons, including the threat that climate change poses. I'm over 50 now, so I won't be changing my mind. I now have 8 nieces and nephews as well as 4 great-nieces and nephews, and I have a lot of fun being the \"cool aunt\". \n\nI'm glad that I chose to forego having kids now that Trump and GOP has been hell-bent on ripping away the rights of women and minorities. Even if Trump is soundly defeated tomorrow, Trumpism and it's grip on our country will still need to be fought on a regular basis. If you want to make a positive difference in a child's life, you can still do that by volunteering your time, energy, and money in a variety of ways. \n\nYour fears and feelings about this are very valid. You still have plenty of time to think about this and even change your mind later on, should you do so. I'm sure you and your husband will make the right decision for the two of you.",
         "I want to join in saying you are not overreacting.\n\nI just had a conversation with my grown daughter (I am a 50 years old woman), where I was very honest with her about being fearful of her getting pregnant. I know she wants to be a mom. It broke my heart to tell her that if Trump is elected I think she really needs to consider her risks if she was to decide to have a child. \n\nI felt like it was important to tell her I love her more than her ability to have a child. I would be devastated to lose her because she could not receive the care she needed if anything went wrong. It was a very sad conversation, because again I know she wants to be a mom. \n\nIt breaks my heart for all women. It breaks my heart that this is where we are.",

But we definitely worried, and continue to worry, about the world we've created for our kids. \n\nThat being said, there is always something to worry about, and tomorrow may bring something worse. My personal ethos is that I'm not going to let other people dictate the story of my life, regardless of what happens. Each person has to decide what they are willing to give up to others and what they are going to risk fighting for.",

I think it\u2019s because I vote blue in a swing state.",

To ease you, your husband does not want children as much as you thought, otherwise he won\u2019t said what he said \u201cwe should wait.\u201d \n\nI am the same as you. My thinking is: If removing women\u2019s right trend continues, how am I ever gonna to protect my daughters? How am I gonna to teach my son to respect women while the politicians thinks women should have no rights or have to listen to their husbands? The cultural impact is huge. I don\u2019t want to have children while women were forced to donate their organs (uterus). \n\nI know that ideally, we should reproduce to outnumber conservatives, but at the same time I am tire of fighting and I don\u2019t think RvW will be reinstated anytime soon. Sandy Hook is 12 years ago but we are no where near federal background checking. If this country care zero about dead kids, they care zero about dead women. That is just the way it is.",
         "Not overreacting. The number of NON-abortion-related medical conversations I've had to have with docs this year about what I'm holding off testing or doing/having go on my medical record is absurd. Thus far, three docs I've had to tell \"I can't go through with that til after the election because it would add to my pre-existing conditions list\". The idea of risking something so much larger as having a child would do me in.",
         "I think there's also the concern about civil war or drafts for foreign wars for the children.  I know that's always a thing, but more likely if Trump is in office.\n\nIf you do choose to have kids I would really recommend that all moms-to-be always keep a valid and active passport and some significant emergency funds.  That doesn't take care of all problems, but at least if you know there's a condition in the fetus where you'd choose abortion you should be able to get out of country for healthcare.",

All of it starting right as h.s. is beginning and going off the rails ever since in so many ways.

I don't want my children to be living in a hellish apocalyptic future.\n\nIt's why I rounded up several friends and dragged them to the polls with me, because the more the better -- this election is too important.",
         "I wish everyone would behave like you. If all the women in this country protested by refusing to have babies, hell, refuse to have sex, this would disappear within a year.

         "I had this discussion with my husband over the weekend. We really want kids but after 4 miscarriages, if Trump wins the risk on my life is too great. It's such a sad reality- I can't understand how people don't see that a ban on abortion would even make those who want to be parents hesitant to try.",
         "Not overreacting. I had an ectopic pregnancy in 2007 in Texas. I got the surgery done in Texas. My OBGYN sent me straight to the ER. There was no question about what had to be done.\n\nI'm 42 now and done having kids. Because I had an ectopic pregnancy before, I am much more likely to have another one than other women.\n\nIf Trump gets elected, I will go straight to my OBGYN and get a new IUD. And then pray I hit menopause in the next 7 years (that's how long IUDs last). I cannot risk birth control being \"outlawed\" or being more regulated than they already are.\n\nI feel sorry for younger women and fear for my children.",

         "You are not overreacting & your reservations are VALID.",
         "I already had a child when he was elected. It was a very difficult 4 years to raise a young man. He was in elementary school.

In fact, I had to teach him to not ever be that way and to use the president as an example of what not to do and who not to be.",
         "I've honestly thought the same. I'm pushing the end of \"if we want #2, we have to do it like now.\" I'm honestly terrified if I *did* become pregnant. I had a miscarriage before my son.

(reminder mail-in ballots can be countered up to like 9 days after election day as long as post-marked on/before election day)\n\nAbsolutely not overreacting. People who can give birth have less rights than others, to include even a corpse. It is both life-wise dangerous (medical care is widely illegal and doctors are too scared to do right thing since will get felony charges) and legal-wise (multiple places deem miscarriages murder).

In one instance,  the pregnant mother died, unfortunately.  We just can't be sure how far republicans will go to strip women's reproductive rights away.",

Rapidly intensifying climate change, possibly living under authoritarian rule \u2013 it\u2019s very frightening.",

I do not want to raise a daughter under his \u201cadministration\u201d if we can even call it that. I am in a blue state, and any major bans are unlikely to go into affect before she is born but I genuinely think if they did I would leave the country. \n\nI have dual citizenship with an EU country and my husband and I have seriously discussed leaving if we need to. Even my father, who was once so proud and happy to achieve citizenship in the US, has pressured me to make sure my EU passport is up to date. One of the first things I will be doing is getting my daughter on the foreign birth registry of my country so that she can have both passports as well. I even found a flight that lets dogs on board (K9 jets) so they don\u2019t have to go in with the luggage. It feels craaaaazy to be planning like that but honestly\u2026it\u2019s necessary.\n\nYou are not alone and you are not crazy.

The president can not overturn a Supreme Court decision. Kamala can not change it even if she wanted. Trump cannot make it a national ban, even if he wanted. Neither can overrule the Supreme Court, which deemed it up to the states. \n\nJust some food for thought for this election cycle. You're not overreacting, and your feelings are valid.

You still have plenty of time before it\u2019s medically hazardous due to age complications. My advice to everyone who could potentially get pregnant is not to get pregnant unless they\u2019re completely sure they want to be pregnant and have a child.

For her, though, it's a huge deal. She has ALWAYS wanted to be a mom. She would be devastated if it never happened. So we've started trying despite the uncertainty of the future. We also live in a blue state where women can seek medical care and abortions.\n\nMy wife also travels for work fairly often; at least twice a month. One of the places she regularly has to travel to is Texas. I was browsing reddit the other day when a thought occurred to me.\n\nShould she get pregnant, there is a high chance she will have to travel to Texas during that time. There is a non-zero chance she could experience complications while in Texas. There is a non-zero chance those complications could be life-threatening. There is a non-zero chance she could be refused the medical care that she needs while in Texas. There is a non-zero chance either her, the baby, or both could die due to the complications and lack of medical care because she couldn't get out of that state in time. The chance is small, but the fact that it's a non-zero chance in the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA is repugnant.\n\nDoesn't matter that we're from a blue state. If something happens while she's there, Texas law is what matters.  If it were up to me, I would be doing exactly what you're doing: Waiting to see who gets elected and refusing to have children if it's Trump.

HOWEVER, this person said that was a false narrative that the GOP are pushing - it wasn't a blue wave on ELECTION NIGHT, but when the final results came in, it was.  People just didn't pay attention like we do in Presidential election years.  \n\nIt was all about that state's method of counting - they rediculously count the in person votes first - even though the mail in ballots could immediately be at least PREPPED before the election.  I believe mine are tabulated (I'm in a vote by mail state) but no one can see the results until 8 PM election night.\n\nWell, especially in 2020 and 2022, a LOT of Dems voted by mail - so essentially the in person votes skewed heavily to GOP.  I believe that is why a lot of people are doing in person early voting in key states.   In a couple of states they changed how they count (VBM isn't delayed)\n\nSo - when you consider THAT plus the fact that many are reporting that women would be nervous to answer a poll that they are voting for Harris because they don't want their husbands or fathers to know - places like Texas and Florida COULD BE IN PLAY.\n\nI am hoping for a Reagan - Mondale blowout, with the winner Harris.

I was given several different narcotic painkillers, including one just before the procedure, plus local anesthetic (needle in cervix is also extremely painful)-which is also way more pain medication than women are usually given for a vacuum abortion.

I keep Plan B around for them just in case.\n\nI am hopeful because I know their generation, and pretty much every generation past Gen X (I'm Gen X, at least we don't seem quite as brainwashed, but still very conservative and kind of prone to not analyzing enough sometimes) has different views. But, gah, we need people to vote (and yes, I know that it's hard sometimes - Texas throws all kinds of stuff in to make it hard, we have an ungodly early registration cutoff, you have to vote in the county you are a resident of which means a lot of college students can't, mail-in voting is only for 65 & up, etc).\n\nSorry, this turned into a mini-rant, but I am glad to see people like those on this thread.

He makes some really good cases about why voting for the lesser evil (if you see her that way) is the only way to keep fighting the good fight. If you hate Trump for any reason, whether it's because he's a rapist, or sparked a multi-front coup against democracy, or has multiple felony convictions, or because you believe in medical science, or don't want to die from survivable pregnancy complications, you need to vote for Harris, and nobody else.\n\nTo any of you who know women or allies that haven't already committed their vote to her, this is the time to help them see the light.

It's sad that we have reached a point where baseline, bottom-of-the-barrel democrat policies are seen as something to be given accolades when they should be a given\u2014a standard. I get it.\n\nBut I don't believe in this rhetoric of voting 3rd party out of protest due to the current democratic party also representing republican sentiment. Some think that if they vote 3rd party it will encourage a reform of democrat representation.\n\nThere is no reform coming. There is no revolution. If you throw away your vote to 3rd party, and think that 4 years of rightwing extremism is a worthy sacrifice to make for an imaginary reform, you're sorely mistaken. We have to shift the compass more \"true\" democrat by starting with what we have. If we allow this country to go even further rightwing, then progressive and left leaning ideology becomes more foreign and unacceptable.\n\nVoting for politicians is like riding a bus: it's rare that you take one single bus to reach your destination\u2014you take the first one to get closer to your goal, before getting onto another.

Of course, this is how it should be: we should be critical and always expect more from our elected officials. \n\nBut leftists need to stop expecting a perfect messiah. For one, the president alone doesn\u2019t enact change\u2014they can appoint officials who will push for change and do the necessary work. Second, politics is a difficult and dirty game; the layperson won\u2019t always know why a certain action was taken, or why something was or wasn\u2019t endorsed. We can only look at the person\u2019s career holistically and gauge their general political motivations.\n\nHarris gets a lot of flack for being a prosecutor, but I don\u2019t know why that\u2019s a bad thing. She\u2019s prosecuted murderers, drug cartels, rapists, sex traffickers. The truant bill is possibly a black mark on her record, but from what I\u2019ve read, she never intended for parents of truants to be arrested. Only like 7 out of thousands she prosecuted were convicted of marijuana possession, along with other crimes in tandem. And yes, being a prosecutor means that sometimes you have to push for sentences that seem harsh or extreme, but that\u2019s part of the job. That\u2019s why defense attorneys exist, to plead for the defendant. \n\nShe was also never \u201cthe border czar,\u201d I don\u2019t know why this keeps getting spread. She was sent to collect information and do field research essentially. Besides, one person cannot \u201csolve\u201d something big like a border crisis within a few months.\n\nI think people are missing the big picture. Which candidate is more likely to listen? Which candidate is more likely to consider the welfare of all groups, not just the elite few, even as they engage in the dirty work of politics? Who\u2019s more likely to push for ceasefire instead of just nuking entire populations out of existence? (And if you answer the orange buffoon to any of these, then you haven\u2019t been paying attention to the campaign at all.)\n\nI get that the bipartisan model limits us somehow, but honestly, with Trump as the only other choice, I don\u2019t see how any liberals can NOT vote for Harris. We already had Roe v. Wade taken away, what else is next?",
         "Yeah I really don't like her but I'll vote for her I guess.",

However, voting for her means women in the US have a chance for real, lasting change that will benefit them in the future.  If Drumpf gets the office, we can kiss everyone's personal freedoms goodbye for generations to come.",

         "Thats exactly what people who vote third party believe as well. I'm voting for Harris today but let's not misrepresent people's views. Left wing eople who don't like Harris and are voting 3rd party are doing so because of beliefs not because of likeability.\n\n\n\n\nEdit: Liberals are actually fucking incapable of having discussions with leftists on anything. All they can do is downvote and act smug. Ugh.",

He will not protect Palestinians. He needs to be kept out of office.",
         "She's much more likely to do that than Trump, that's for sure.\n\nIt may suck to vote for the lesser evil, but remember: not doing so means giving the greater evil better odds of winning, indirectly helping it.",
         "Single-issue voting is short-sighted, overly simplistic to the point of delusional, and inevitably self-defeating. \n\nIf you pretend the world can be broken down to individual issues without impacting anything else, you'll end up losing so many battles you didn't even choose to fight. It isn't how reality works.",
         "And if Trump is elected, what little pushback there is from the current administration will disappear. Things will get worse.\n\nIs it insane that both parties in the US condone genocide? Yes. Is it worth further endangering the lives of people in the Middle East just to say \"fuck you\" to one of those parties? I'd argue it's not.\n\nBetter to vote for anti-genocide candidates for local government and the House and Senate, imo.",

Otherwise you are just regurgitating stupidity and using people dying as an opportunity to feel morally superior. If you care about saving lives both in YOUR country and others, then you need to vote for Harris. But by all means, sit it out and not vote, and contribute to possibly letting another teenager die because some piece of shit doctor doesn\u2019t want to a dnc. \n\nIf Trump wins there will be many more lives lost all over the world. He will let Russia and North Korea run wild. We will head to a global war with millions of lives lost. Does that not matter to you? Or is Gaza the only place that you care about? I saw in another comment that you said you don\u2019t care about Trump. It doesn\u2019t matter if you care about him or not. The reality is more people will die with him. How can you not see that republicans are stripping women of their rights? Do you not care about that either? Honestly if you don\u2019t, then I don\u2019t think that you really care about the Middle East, either.",

         "On a related note, I really wondered what could be driving the Iowa poll results when it comes to women. I had not realised until yesterday that the state brought in a 6-week abortion ban at the end of July (I have broadly followed this issue from Australia, but was unaware of this in relation to the situations of many individual states)! A poll I read also found that 2/3 of Iowans polled did not support that legal change.\n\nI'm really interested to see the electoral impact of these issues, and I hope things will turn around. I too have seen plenty of horrible stories about how this has affected women."

At my insistence (and to his credit he took my word for it) we chose not to save money by ordering only \u201cunisex\u201d cuts and instead split the quantity across unisex (which is really men\u2019s) and women\u2019s, in order to accommodate women in staff who might prefer a women\u2019s cut shirt. \n\nWhile deciding on the distribution of sizes for women, he kept trying to skew the total to include more small/medium and fewer lg/xl. I had to explain to him that women\u2019s sizes were ALREADY smaller than men\u2019s and we don\u2019t have to skew the sizes\u2014the size difference is already configured in the women\u2019s cut, and likely to an exaggerated degree. If we skew our order towards smaller sizes, when they are already smaller, we\u2019ll end up unable to serve women needing larger sizes at all. To make my point I let him know I wear an XL in most women\u2019s styles which completely surprised him. (I\u2019m a 14/16 size) It was clear that he only interprets the size of a woman in relation to the size of a man, and it really took some mental gymnastics for him to understand that women vary in size compared with on other women, even if on average they may be a little smaller. He thinks of me as \u201csmall\u201d, but I\u2019m average\u2014and in the world of women\u2019s clothing size, I\u2019m fucking huge.\n\nHe listened to me and followed my suggestions, but man is it frustrating to, once again, encounter man-as-default. The website we\u2019re using has a category for \u201cAdult Apparel\u201d with all male models, and a category for \u201cWomen\u2019s Apparel\u201d. As a dark-humor joke, as we put together our order I started referring to each category as \u201cdefault human\u201d and \u201cwoman\u201d. Where is the unisex category???? \n\n",

Or a tight medium, and I think most people wanna keep it more relaxed-fit at work. So L-XL is going to be the average woman\u2019s size, imo.",

Some dude in purchasing ordering for the imaginary hordes of petite women. \n\nWe aren't that small here at all. Some of us aren't small at all (me, and the other 99th percentile height ladies) If the average height for women is about 5'3\", and the average clothing size is 14/16, and the average shoe size is 9, women's bodies are NOT on average built like fragile little dolls. Even small women are not actually as small as men think. The small to average height majority apparently often takes the same size i do at 6', for 14/16 to be the average size in the US. That's the size I take too, but I'm long/tall length. We have fat and muscle and boobies hips and curves, or literally large bones, or prefer loose fit...all kinds of reasons to need that 'large' (really average) sizes. Give us our damn XLs lol. But also still get an appropriate # of small sizes because there are some women who are built short + petite, they are just not the majority/average! \nI sell clothes & shoes and my best sellers are 14-16, XL & XXL, and shoes in 9-11. That tells me that the current well known average sizes are 100% spot on real, and I stock my inventory accordingly.",

Absolutely! And they also struggle to find clothing that works for them. That's absolutely a thing. I rarely see petite sizes in store and even if they are, there's still folks who need smaller sizes.\n\nThen there's plus sizes. Many places don't even offer plus sizes. \n\nWork apparel is horrible for this! We just got a notification about ordering new sweaters and I had to specifically request a men's sweater. The women's only goes up to an XL which is really not an XL. And I'm a size 20-24, so an XL won't fit. \n\nEven if I lose weight, I am broad shouldered. My shoulders won't shrink, they're wide.

They were cute and soft and the women's apparel was really lacking. I have generous boobs and stomach, so I got a larger men's size. EVEN THEN, the shirts fit really weirdly: no room in the chest, which caused gapping under the arms, despite the fact that it was tent-sized. I mean, that makes sense, but women are not just shorter men, so I HATE WITH A FIREY PASSION all garments unisex. And yes, clothing for women is so weirdly sized, and not consistent at all, especially with different brands.",

         "Yes, they have no idea. Some time ago, I had to file a police report about a creep who was lurking and touching himself around a school and businesses near my house. I saw him on my way to the bus stop, and he tried to grab me, but he had no idea what kind of wild bitch I am, so he ended up running away.  \nAnyway, I called the police, and when they arrived, one of the officers took my statement. He never asked about my height or weight, but when he gave me the paper to sign, I noticed he had put my height at 5'2\" and my weight at 120. I understand the height discrepancy because, even though I'm only 5', I tend to look taller. However, I was around 145-150 lbs back then.  \nBefore I could mention my actual weight, the other officer asked me something, so I signed the paper and handed it back. Later that day, as I was reading the copy they gave me, I kept dwelling on the weight thing. I had never interacted with the police like that before, so I didn\u2019t know how things worked. I kept thinking that maybe my weight wasn\u2019t that important, but there's a reason they have that section. Why not ask instead of just writing whatever?  \nAt first, I thought the officer might be one of those men who believe that 120 lbs is heavy for a woman, so he saw that I wasn\u2019t skinny and thought, \u201c120 it is.\u201d However, whenever I share my weight with men (I\u2019m into weightlifting and strength training), they never believe me when I tell them I\u2019m usually between 155-160 lbs. It blows their minds when I step onto the scale; it\u2019s as if they can\u2019t comprehend that a woman of my height can weigh that much.",
         "I wish we had a standard. I have pants that goes from sizes small to 2x and 2 to 13. For adult clothes, I just grab the same thing in varying sizes and go from there. \n\nI think this may have to do with how there's very little regulation on women's clothes compared to men's. And I actually think it's gotten worse over the years.",
         "I am genuinely on the smaller side and I still wear a large women\u2019s shirt. I\u2019m tall and I have broad shoulders so I wear a 4/6 in pants but I\u2019m going need a bigger shirt to cover my tummy and not bust out the shoulders.",
         "I've noticed this too. If I was ever to tell a man how much I actually weighed, they would not believe me. It's so frustrating how skewed this is and it contributes to a larger problem. I'm tired of it all. Women have to deal with so much and trying to articulate it when it is miniscule issues piled on top of others - no wonder men don't see it.",
         "Yeah, that's bullshit.  And then make sure you communicate to the women that you have unisex and women's sizes available.

         "Kind of related but at my old job we had to wear polos.

We have been discussing my need for more of the aftercare surrounding our kink sessions, and that he keeps falling asleep on me, and if my needs aren\u2019t met there, I can\u2019t continue the kink with him.

I had to explain to him that, while he views them as terms of endearment for me, they are very degrading terms, and I need the reassurance and care afterwards. I watched the lightbulb come on when he realized that these terms had been used against me as an insult by pathetic people from the time I was 12, and that they did come with a sting. \n\nI\u2019m glad we were able to have the conversation, and I think that things will get better from here.

In men size, I wear 9 (which is the easiest way to find shoes that fit my large feet), but in women sizes, it can go anywhere between 10 and 12 depending on the width. I can't wear most women's shoes because they are too narrow.\n\nIn the unified scale, it is around 41 I think, but again, it depends on the width. Men's are larger and fit good.

I thought nothing of it, I\u2019ve dabbled with kissing girls but really couldn\u2019t sleep with one. At the end of the night we all went back to our hotel room for more drinks. I was absolutely wasted and laid on the bed and this girl laid next to me hugging me. I was tipsy. It didn\u2019t worry me. But then her partner and my sister went outside briefly and she started trying to touch me \u201cdown there \u201c I was so drunk I couldn\u2019t move so I just pulled away as much as I could and she eventually stopped.

I hate running loud noisy vacuum cleaners that might annoy other people in the house even when I know the only people in the house are not alloyed by them.

It obviously lowers A1C and dropped my husband down to totally normal levels. It also helps improve kidney health and if you have liver damage, your kidneys often suffer too. My husband has cysts on his kidneys and it\u2019s something I often worry about. He has labs done in February and several of them were out of normal ranges. We redid them a couple of months ago and everything except his cholesterol and vitamin d were normal for the first time in at least 4 years. I\u2019m in shock how much healthier he is.\n\nShould everyone take it? No. But like I talked with my husband before he started it, the consequences his body was suffering from were already up there and we needed to try something to help his liver before it progressed worse. We knew what would eventually happen if he did nothing, whereas he might not have any issues from the wegovy. I hate that it\u2019s getting such a bad name because some people didn\u2019t really need it and used it for 10 pound weight losses when the side effects of obesity are kind of glossed over anymore (I say this as someone who also needs to lose weight, but I don\u2019t have the health issues that would justify the medication)."

Then *it* happened. I walked into the office the next morning looking at all the cishet white men I worked with, and wondering about each of them, \"was it you?\"\u00a0\n\n\n8 years later, all dread and anxiety. I will still attempt to go to work. I expect to stumble through meetings and essentially check the box of being there as required. My ex and I were trying to plan out food for election night because we'll watch the coverage together with the kids, who are also terrified, and we're just both kind of like, \"what do you serve for the end of the world as you know it?\" We decided on tacos.\u00a0",
         "Things are different.  We've learned from 2016.  Many have had regret that they didn't bother going to vote because they ASSUMED Hillary had it and that their vote didn't matter, and they didn't make the time to stand in line to vote. \n\nWe had Roe v Wade then, and I don't think people felt it would actually be overturned.  Hell, the Trump judges said they wouldn't. They lied, obviously.  I wasn't even sure it was at risk or he was just lying like he usually does (he's been a liar for years) - but I still knew that the Supreme Court was vitally important. \n\nBut every damn thing HRC warned us about came to fruition.   She TRIED, and the failure was in us - white women.  Sure there are women who lean into the white patriarchy and genuinely vote for Trump and his ilk up and down the ballot... but I think there was this assumption that both racism and misogyny were tossed out when Obama was elected (neither are true).\n\nBut now - Roe is gone.  An overwhelming record of women over 60 are turning out.  I believe that it isn't a coincidence.  These are the women that REMEMBER the time before Roe.  Who perhaps remember a family member or family friend who had to have a back alley abortion.  Remember the secret whispers.  Or sadly, remember the funerals.   Over 60... probably not at risk of needing an abortion, but their daughters, their nieces, their granddaughters, their friends' daughters... women they've watched grow up, they are the ones dying.\n\nThen we had January 6th.  If Roe didn't convince some of these voters - that did.  We're a land of many faiths, cultures, backgrounds.  We (should) believe in separation of church and state.  If ANY place is sacred to all Americans, it should be that Capital building.  Perhaps even more than the White House, which holds at best two voices representing the people (if you count the VP... not every VP is of the calibre of Biden or Harris.  President Biden has revolutionized that role, for the better)  But the Capital holds all our collective voices, representing every state in our Union.  It isn't just because of space that the President is sworn in there and not at the White House or the Supreme Court. \n\nShe's only been campaigning for 100 days... and the energy it has created is so impressive.  I know some have said it reminds them of the Obama campaign, and with all due respect... I completely disagree.   It feels like the 1992 campaign.  Bill Clinton was a total change.  He was of a different generation.  He knew how to talk to us, the young people. He was captivating - could entertain, yes, and had great taste in rally music, but could also explain his ideas (much more than concepts) in a way that was detailed but not condescending.  He still has some of that zip and humor on this campaign trail - but go on YouTube and find the Aresenio Hall performance.  Yes, he got up and played the sax, but he ALSO did a great sit down interview with Arsenio.   Sadly, I think part of the problem HRC had was she had to distance herself from that a little bit so that people could see that she is her own person.  Also, I think she did not pick the right VP.    Kamala?  She found a person that has the energy of one other famous, supportive former Vice President - Joe Biden.  Joe has a lot to do with getting Barack Obama elected, IMHO, and Tim has been doing the same.  Both managed to not overshadow or EVER let someone think that the presidential candidate wasn't the one in charge and the one who will be in charge.  (Damn impressive when you are the older, more experienced white guy supporting the first Black candidate, and damn impressive when you are the same aged white guy from the midwest who is entirely relatable to so many dudes out there)\n\n  \nI'm rambling and even deleted a bunch of stuff that really doesn't relate to your anxiety - I'm obviously feeling it myself.  I couldn't postcard this week (because the postcards wouldn't arrive in time) so I've been text banking frantically through my state Dem office, to remind people to drop off their ballots before 8 PM.",
         "There are so many of us who feel the same way-all over the world, waiting in anticipation.  Will the USA choose fascism or democracy?  \n\nHow can this election even be close?",
         "I was the only person in my day-to-day life who was sure Trump would win. I tried to get everybody to take that possibility seriously. They told me I was concerned about nothing, that people wouldn\u2019t *actually* vote for a reality TV host in any significant numbers. Look who was right.",
         "I was in college working on a research paper and had the election newscast on in the background. Just chilling on the couch with my laptop and cat and some poverty food. Around 9pm, I was pretty optimistic and excited. And then Trump started getting electoral votes and pushed past Hillary. It was like 12am and I was astonished and sooooo disappointed. I couldn't focus on my paper, it felt like some twilight zone shit. I closed my laptop, told my cat goodnight and went to my room and cried myself to sleep. My country has let me down BIG time that night and I'm so scared it'll happen tomorrow again. His presidency was insanity, sadness, unnecessary death and violent hate. Please Lord, let Kamala be our next president. \ud83d\ude4f",
         "I hope as many people as possible feel the same way you do now and vote. I knew he was gonna win in 2016. I remember being the only one at work that day feeling the dread we all feel now.",
         "I wasn't excited for Clinton, but I voted for her because I damn sure wasn't going to skip the oppurtunity to say I voted for the first woman president if the US to my nieces and nephews in the future.\u00a0\n\n\nTrump in 2016 sort of broke me. I just stayed in bed all day the day after. I was a grad student, and I think I may have even skipped class.\u00a0\n\n\nI was so anxious in 2020 I just took the semester off. 2020 was a shit year.",
         "I went to sleep that night, knowing there was just no way he would win. I woke up a few hours later to pee and I was just devastated. I cried. I saw what was coming. I've been told I'm exaggerating and blowing it out of proportion for years.\n\nWell, here we are. I'm praying for a different outcome come tomorrow morning.",
         "I was a 30 year old mom of two young children in 2016. The election season was exciting and I went through election day riding the high on the feeling that there was no doubt Hilary would win. I remember driving to pick up my sister from a Democratic election party after it became clear that Hilary wasn't going to win. I was so upset, and driving far too fast. Later that night I sat sobbing with my then husband, fearful of what a Trump presidency meant as a wife of an Asian man and Mom of biracial children. I could only make it through  half of my workday in the day after the election as I was sobbing at the thought of what the future might hold. This election has felt a little better, but the fear of a repeat has definitely put a damper on my optimism that voters will do the right thing. I won't believe the election results until Harris is sworn into office.",
         "Yes. Dread and laying here awake reading about others' dread now. But, I'm comforted I'm not alone.",
         "We were invited to an election party tomorrow, but neither my husband nor I want to go.  My just-turned eight year old, who was a newborn in 2016 (I voted for Clinton while holding my week-old baby in my lap) requested that I not watch anything about the election where she might see it and just tell her who won when it is over.  I warned her that might be days.  We are all preparing for more trauma, I think.  I\u2019m hopeful it will end up being a good day.",
         "I truly believed 2016 would be a walkover. I didn't understand the depth of resentment that exists within the eternal manufactured victimhood that is white American \"christians\".\n\nI now understand that all they care about is winning, and they're willing to burn the whole country down to never experience losing to a black person or woman again. \n\nThat's why I'm scared.",
         "Oh. 100%. My wife is convinced she\u2019s going to win in a landslide but I can\u2019t get 2016 out of my head. Today is going to suck\u2026 unless it doesn\u2019t. Ugh.",
         "I knew Hillary wouldn\u2019t win unfortunately. I wanted her to win over Trump definitely but\u2026\n\nI\u2019m old enough to remember how much GOP \u201cHillary Hate\u201d there was from Bill\u2019s presidency that moderate Republicans would just stay home and not vote rather than vote for either candidate. They would never cross over to vote for her but might have if Bernie Sanders had been the candidate.\n\nTo too many people, it seemed like Hillary felt she should be president because she *deserved* it.\n\nWith Kamala, it feels like she should be president because *we* deserve it!",
         "I'm in PA. I remember driving home from work and seeing lines I've never seen before at polling places. I knew then something was happening and it probably was for him. This time I think the momentum is in the other directions.",
         "I wasn\u2019t thrilled with hilary but donald seemed like that could never happen. \n\nmy first election was 2008. the energy right now feels way more similar to 2008 than 2016",
         "Like, the feeling just keeps growing every time I hear that this poll and that expert confirms that Harris is 100% in the bag. I'm just over here like  (\u00b0_______\u00b0)",
         "I don\u2019t think it is the same scenario as with Clinton. I clearly remember thinking I don\u2019t think this is a slam dunk with her bc so many people around me seem in love with trump. \n\nThis time around people remember what happened in 2016 and are out aggressively voting. And this includes all parties. Remember: just bc someone is a registered Republican doesn\u2019t mean they are not voting for Harris. Maybe they registered years ago and never bothered changing. I was a registered Independent till last year and have voted 99% of the time Democrat.",
         "\\> I was convinced Hillary would win\n\nI honestly maintain that was the problem at the last two elections.\n\nDon't get me wrong, even as someone who totally gets that the Democrats kinda suck: I **cannot** possibly understand the appeal of voting for that Putin-loving, misogynistic self-serving cretin.\n\nAbout the ONLY thing about him I can respect is at least he is transparent. (Note: I say transparent, not honest).\n\nI was nervous when it was Biden vs Trump.  \nWhen Kamala took over I honestly assumed she would landslide it in, just on the basis of \"I'm not an old bloke that struggles to remember what I ate for breakfast last week\".\n\nI would have pictured a piece of wet cardboard would have won out in a 3 way between Trump and Biden.\n\nThe fact that we're going into this election where there is a distinctly strong possibility that Trump could be President of the US come January is absolutely mind boggling to me.",
         "Yeah it was, and I am not exaggerating, one of the biggest shocks of my life. It was truly traumatic for me because *gestures at literally everything* that has come to pass. I fucking KNEW exactly how a trump presidency would play out, I knew roe v wade was going to get fucked, I knew gay rights would be under attack, I knew transphobia would get worse than ever, I knew America would become a totally backwards, handmaids tale nightmare, and **everyone told me I was overreacting.**\n\nNope, I sure wasn\u2019t. I was right, about all of it. The worst part for me personally was that I was PREGNANT at the time, with a little girl \ud83d\udc9c. I was fucking devastated. I couldn\u2019t wait to tell her when she got older that when I was pregnant with her, we elected our first female president. Instead, I stayed up all night watching in horror as I realized that the world just got a lot more dangerous for the both of us and that I was having her at a time where, frankly, she would not have as high of a quality of life as I had growing up. \n\nI told my husband my heart just can\u2019t take a repeat of that night again. I can\u2019t hope, I can\u2019t be optimistic, I don\u2019t care if my attitude is doom and gloom, women can\u2019t afford to be cavalier about this. It is horrifying reading how checked out young people are, like, decisions were made years ago now that are going to impact my daughter\u2019s daughters, maybe even further generations. It has never been more important. People don\u2019t understand that this really is life or death right now. You bet your ass my ballot is in lol.",
         "Maybe it\u2019s cause I\u2019m in California, but I liked Clinton more than Harris. I have some issues w Harris\u2019 time as AG of SF and the handling of Gaza as a woman of color. \n\nI was super excited for Clinton in 2016. I\u2019m not as excited for Harris but I am praying so so SO hard that she wins tomorrow. I\u2019ve voted, donated, phone banked and canvassed for her because I have to. Because this election literally could change our country and there are too many things on the line. For all my issues with Harris, she is competent and she has experience and she\u2019ll make a solid president.",
         "Yes. I'm quite a bit older than you but I cried in the shower for days after the 2016 election after being so very sure Hillary would win. Now I feel a sense of sinking dread that's only grown worse as we grow closer to November 5th. I can't let myself hope.",
         "I just wish the party could get away from the Clintons so it was OK to go after Trump on his Epstein connection. The new Epstein tapes indicate Trump was still close with him WHILE IN THE WHITE HOUSE but still it doesn't seem to matter. Obviously can't trust Epstein at his word, and screw the journalist for holding onto it until this week. I just want Kamala to win and for it to be over. This has felt like the longest election of my lifetime",
         "Felt that way in 2016. Started volunteering so I would know I did everything I could to ensure it would never happen again. Haven't felt that way since. I'm off to work the polls this morning... if you're stressing, call/text your friends and family reminders to vote\u00a0 and offer to drive someone to the polls today! We'll be waiting for them!",
         "I remember when there was talk of Donald Trump running for President. I thought it was a joke. When I realized it was true, I didn't worry because \"he'll never make it through the primaries\". Well, I was wrong. He was the republican candidate. I was not excited. I didn't like or trust either candidate. I voted for Clinton, I don't know why I felt she was a better choice...we hadn't seen how bad Trump could be yet. When Trump won I remember hearing about people crying because Hillary didn't win. I didn't really understand it... probably because I didn't like or trust her either. Well now it's 2024 and we've lived through a Trump presidency and the aftermath.... And now through his bizarre 2024 campaign. I don't even want to imagine what would become of America if he were to win. I'm optimistic that Harris/Waltz will win and I think they are a great combination. I am excited about her goal for unity. I excited because she is an experienced, competent candidate...And as a bonus, she's a woman of color! I still fear the havoc that we have to endure from Trump and MAGAs. I'm ready for country to work together and stop the hatred.",
         "As a Brit who watched the EU referendum unfold the wrong way, after everyone being so confident we'd stay, I was looking to the US to prove some semblance of sanity remained in the general public but nope. I remember just feeling so defeated. Disappointed twice that year. In both cases I can't help but wonder how badly \"joke\" voters ruined it for us. Yes both Leave and Republicans have genuine supporters but there was definitely a swathe of people who thought \"Haha it will be so funny to vote for Farage/Trump\" as a joke. I hope those people have a small stone in their shoe they can never find for the rest of their life. \n\n I'm hoping by that same logic though that just as the Conservatives were trashed in our election, so too will be Trump.",
         "Y E S",
         "Yes. I am filled with dread due to fear he\u2019ll get elected and fear of how the nut jobs will react if he\u2019s not. There are tons of supporters who have said they will be up in arms if he doesn\u2019t win and some of those nut jobs have guns. I can\u2019t remember where it was, but I read a very in depth article by someone who went to some sort of automatic rifle festival and there were many people talking about how they would take to the streets with their guns if he isn\u2019t back in the White House.",

         "I cried all night in 2016. When they called the results for WI I knew it was over and I couldn't stop. I'm an immigrant and I was sure my paths to legal employment were closing. They didn't because Trump was too weak to even touch NAFTA in any meaningful way (essentialy all that happened was a name change) but I was so so scared.\n\nI'm scared today.",
         "I watched the SNL opening skit with Kamala Harris. It made me smile, but then my mind immediately jumped to Kate McKinnon singing Hallelujah after the 2016 election.\n\nI\u2019m scared. I feel so helpless that big decisions are being made by people who don\u2019t think one iota about the consequences of their choices. Who are proud to vote for people wanting to take away rights and dignities of others. \n\nHillary Clinton was one of the most qualified people to ever run for president. We turned her down for a circus clown who named himself ringmaster and let the lions run amok. \n\nMy father doesn\u2019t get it. He says it doesn\u2019t matter who you vote for, that things will be ok. But for a 6-foot-something heterosexual white man, very little will change. I have done my best to convince him, but it scares me that so many voices go unheard because people don\u2019t want to listen, or because we assume everyone\u2019s experiences are like ours.\n\nI hope we make a good decision this time.",

         "The reason why I feel afraid is the stupid electoral college. Trump lost the popular vote in 2016. I honestly doubt he's going to win the popular vote this time. What scares me, again, is the fucking electoral college.",
         "No. I did vote for Hillary as a lesser of 2 evils sort of thing. I didn't want that orange idiot to win. But she was a terrible example of feminism and was not respected amongst her colleagues and most world leaders. \n\nI'm convinced that had she dumped her husband after he publicly humiliated her for the tenth time, she would've captured women's spirits & shown us a new threshold of behavior that women should accept. Instead, she stayed with him to bolster her political aspirations... and look at how far THAT got her.",
         "Crushing dread is an accurate description. I just got back from.the polls and I almost started crying while waiting in line.",
         "I wrote in Sanders. I was so angry about the dems choosing Hillary. I didn't want to just vote for whoever the party threw at me. So many of us did. And standing on that moral ground got us some of the worst years of our lives. I didn't think my vote would matter because I assumed Hillary had it in the bag. I remember feeling so sick after. We went to dinner with my conservative in-laws and they were so happy. I just wanted to throw up. So yeah. I'm filled with so much dread. But against so many odds, I have hope.",

         "Yup. Unfortunately, some of those bright-eyed college kids voted for Jill Stein, and that resulted in a Trump win. The same thing happened in 2000, too.\n\nThe importance of education and learning history so you don't repeat it...",

I haven\u2019t even really allowed myself to feel hope for more than a few minutes at a time. I dreaded how bad a trump presidency could be then (and it was) and I know how much worse it could be now.

Everyone was so excited, it felt productive and patriotic even though my Clinton vote knowingly didn\u2019t matter as far as the electoral college. \n\nI watched it unfold in the library as I was writing a paper. Needless to say: I didn\u2019t sleep that night. Most if not all of my classes were canceled by my professors. The vibes nosedived. I\u2019m *terrified* of any semblance this election has of 2016.

         "I am staunchly Democratic, and I would have loved for a woman to be President, but I didn't think Hillary would win and I wasn't a huge fan (though of course I voted for her).  I feel completely different in/about this election.  I think Harris would be phenomenal for our country on a whole host of levels, and I truly think she's going to win.",
         "I voted that day, it was my first vote for president. I had been old enough to vote in the previous election but I hadn't - my life was busy and politics was not the top of my agenda, and I hadn't had time to get my voter paperwork together. I remember telling someone we couldn't let him win, when I voted.\n\nI closed at the restaurant I worked at, at the time. I remember sitting at the bar once it was closed with the closing manager, the news turned up, watching the votes roll in and realizing that night Trump had won. I was so confident Hilary would win. I couldn't imagine people voting for the ex-reality star who painted himself orange and assaulted women. \n\nI am so, so scared today. I'm scared he's going to win and what the future might hold. I'm scared he's going to lose and violence will be prevalent for weeks and months. I work today and I can barely focus. I know it's far too early to turn on the news and see any sort of accurate prediction. I even know that early voting turnout and huge lines at the polls could mean she's going to win, in a crushing landslide that will make me feel silly for being so scared. \n\nI live in a red state, now - I lived in a deep blue one in 2016. In 2016 I saw only Hilary signs, maybe one or two republican signs. My next door neighbors put out two Trump signs in response to our Harris yard sign, plus a \"let's go brandon\" sign facing our home. The family across the street with the little girl have a Trump flag, put up after my signs. I pass at least a dozen houses with Trump signs - some with **many** signs and flags - on the drive to the park every morning with my dog. \n\nI'm just tired, and scared, and I really, really hope tonight goes well.",

         "Technically she did win. I don't think a republican ever won the popular vote for as long as I've been living, at least. I wouldn't be worried at all about Kamala's chances if it weren't for the electoral college voting against the majority of people in 2016.",
         "Of course. I'm dying",

To read about countries like Afghanistan and Iran being places with more liberal governments that got toppled and now women have been relegated to roles they thought they wouldn\u2019t have to see again \u2014 it\u2019s absolutely heartbreaking.\n\nTo see civil rights, hate crime legislation and pushes for equality being attacked at state level all across the nation is chilling.\n\nThe Supreme Court is gone for at least a generation \u2014 possibly for much longer. They are no longer interested in protecting the diversity of Americans, just the conservative minority that placed them in power.\n\nI hope things don\u2019t get worse today. I don\u2019t love Harris, but you bet I voted for her. \n\nI\u2019m trying to stay hopeful \u2014 there\u2019s lots of pushes to experiment with new ways to practice democracy.

When the polls went off kilter in '16 and in '20 (albeit not as badly in 20), the media fed well with \"close races\".  Polls are now more far more curated to 'make it close'. Simply put, there's no ratings/money to be had in a blowout election.

I think not revealing many or at all policies that differentiated her in some way, may have made some people feel apathetic, especially younger voter's.\n\nThen they went hard in targeting conservatives who don't like Trump.\n\n(While it is fine It still is a really questionable move for future elections as those voters will definitely eventually go running back as soon as the GOP puts up someone who isn't insane.)\n\nOn top of that I don't believe it is that great that they are touting a Cheney around. Like at this rate it doesn't sound insane to me if you talk about them campaigning with a Pence 8 years from now.\n\nI feel the Dems are really lucky that the Trump campaign has also decided to be ran as awfully as Trump is as a person. \n\nLike if we look back at history, assassination survivors tend to crush their election.

         "Not who you asked, but someone who\u2019s been very involved in politics for almost 20 years now and I have to agree that Bernie would have been won. In 2016, the voting population was in a very anti-establishment mood and Clinton was the embodiment of the establishment. Obama came in as the GOP was rightfully blamed for the Great Recession, but his administration did a lot of half measures despite having a super majority in Congress for most of his first year. A lot of traditionally Democratic rural counties felt neglected by the party at that point and were willing to support Trump because he ran a very populist campaign. He wasn\u2019t one, but that\u2019s how he presented himself and the Democratic Party did minimal pushback.\n\nSanders is an actual populist and a lot of the policies he supports, like Medicare for All, has majority support across party lines. He very likely could have kept those traditional Democratic bastions that have drifted to the GOP in the last 15 years while getting the votes Clinton got. Putting Sanders directly against Trump, I think Sanders would have been able to win over the voters by talking up policies because they were popular. Trump just offered the chance to give the finger to the establishment.",
         "Based on Sanders' relative popularity compared to Trump. I voted for Hillary even though there were plenty of assholes like you willing to call me a Bernie Bro even after the primary upset. Sanders simply had a much wider popularity margin than Hillary. Her margin to victory in retrospect was far too narrow even with the popular vote in her pocket (because the electoral college sucks). \n\n\n\nSo what's your genius take? Is it as simple as saying more people should have voted for Hillary because Trump is a fascist? If only they had your IQ? It's comforting to know that even after the election there will still be sniveling nerds online asking for proof for comments that they couldn't give two shits about even if the sources were rock solid.",

         "I\u2019m pretty involved in politics too and I think Bernie would have lost. My biggest issue with Bernie was and always has been his lack of judgment in the people running his campaign and his lack of ability in coalition building. He won in states with largely white progressives and tanked in states with diversity. I thought for sure he would have learned his lesson on that in 2020, but he did not.\n\nBernie and his supporters always thought that his popular ideas would win the day. I\u2019m much more cynical, but there\u2019s no way he would have won. Medicare for all is a popular idea in theory but the fearmongering around it hadn\u2019t happened yet.\n\nPolling is always going to favor the candidate with no chance of winning. It\u2019s why Elizabeth Warren was polling higher than Hillary with progressives until she actually ran. Then she tanked rapidly. \n\nI would have voted for Bernie in the general, but I wouldn\u2019t have been enthusiastic about it because I just didn\u2019t see him ever respond well to different points of view.",

I'll my best to keep it simple.\n\nSo, my parents are divorced, and I live with my dad, and my mom doesn't have any custody. But, my dad has been letting me see her without him there a couple times a month since I became a teenager.\n\nI know and heard that she wasn't great back then, but I thought it was pretty cool to hang out with her like friends even though my dad says my mom is just acting liks a cool mom because she doesn't want any actual responsibilities of being a parent.\n\nBut anyways, awhile ago, my mom suddenly brought an adult toy and gave to me saying it's time for me to have this and start exploring. And, she wanted to talk about boys or some other things. I thought it was awkward and embarrassing and I didn't really know what to do, but my mom wanted to ask and talk about things saying it was like a mother and daughter kind of moment, so I kind of went with it. And later, she told me that it was a secret and I shouldn't tell dad.\n\nSo, I went home and didn't really say anything to dad, and I just hid that toy in my closet.\n\nAnd after that, mom bought me like thongs or other revealing undies a couple times, but since I don't wear those yet and since they were weirdly expensive, I didn't know what to do, so I hid them in the closet too (sorry it's getting longer. I'll try to wrap it up).\n\nAnd a few days ago, my dad found those in my closet and got really mad and started asking where I got them and if I use them and all. I told him everything, and he kept asking more and I answered them all even though it was embarrassing because he was really upset and I didn't want to get in trouble or put my mom in more trouble.\n\nThen, after all that, my dad said my mom was out of line and he won't let her see me. And, he told me I can't talk to her until he tells me I can, and he will talk to my mom about this.\n\nI feel like I really messed up, and I feel like maybe I should told him right away when those happened or just threw things away, or something.\n\nAnd I feel bad, sad, and all, but I don't know how to fix this. And for a temporary measures, I'm not allowed to close my door, and he checks my phone.\n\nHow do I fix this? And, should I try to talk to my dad more about this?

Your dad is angry because your mom, and adult, seems incapable of acknowledging that purchasing those things for you is not part of an age appropriate conversation with a child about sex. Your mom also telling you to keep it a secret from your dad, however, demonstrates that she does understand, even if she does not want to admit, that her actions were not okay.

Your mom does not seem like an adult who is willing to honor and respect her role as a mother, not a friend or equal, in this matter.",

Let your parents sort this out, that\u2019s their duty to you as the child. \n\nI would just suggest that you keep open communication with your dad. He seems like a good egg, and if things your mom (or any other adult) says or does make you feel uncomfortable, you can tell him about that rather than hiding them away in your closet.",
         "My advice, based on how I parent my teens -\n\nIt was gross and inappropriate for your mom to buy you toys and sexy underwear. It was also gross and inappropriate for your dad to ask if you masturbate and to take your door away. \n\nYou haven't done *anything* wrong.\n\nTell your dad that you were really uncomfortable with the stuff your mom bought, but it was too embarrassing to tell him, that's why you hid it. Tell him you understand that he's trying to protect you, but asking you humiliating questions and punishing you by taking away your privacy made things worse and now you feel like you can't talk to him about anything. If he's a good dad he'll listen and admit that he overreacted.\n\nI do agree with him about limiting your contact with your mom. If a man bought his daughter those items it'd be grooming, 100%. He's scared for you. It can be a little different with moms & daughters, IF the mom's goal is to teach her daughter that sexuality is normal and healthy. Even then, though, it'd be more like \"When you're old enough, if you want to purchase things, go for it - it's normal and nothing to be ashamed of!\" Gifting your kid toys and lingerie isn't normal, and I've been there. My bio mom gave me stuff *for Christmas* when I was like 20. It was weird then and now I know it was super weird. I've had to set really firm boundaries with her for a lot of reasons.",

Your father is angry and his reaction was not the best but I assume he is worried thinking about what else did your mom expose you to. \n\nPlease be careful around your mom.

You don\u2019t need toys to explore your sexuality, and while I can understand teaching about them or even potentially suggesting them one day, what she did is just \u2026 kinda gross. \n\nIf I ever came across a toy belonging to my child, I\u2019d pretend I never saw it and move on. But the issue here is it seems like she\u2019s trying to undermine your Dad\u2019s authority. It\u2019s like \u2026 \u201chey I\u2019m the cool parent you can trust me\u201d or something. \n\nAs for not closing your door? Absolutely not. He\u2019s punishing you for something your Mom did, and taking away privacy is such a messed up thing to do in general, unless it\u2019s for safety reasons (like self harm). If this were me, I would write a letter and send it to them both explaining why you\u2019re upset and why being punished for something you didn\u2019t do is going to make you trust them a lot less. \n\nSet boundaries. Mom, if you want to buy me a gift, please talk to Dad first so I don\u2019t get in trouble for accepting it. And no more intimate items, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with it. Dad, you punished me for something I didn\u2019t do, is that what you want me to learn from this? That I can\u2019t trust you? Or that if I come to you with a sensitive subject like this, that you\u2019ll punish me for it? \n\nBecause this behavior is gonna lead to you going no contact with both of them once you\u2019re 18.",
         "Your dad is correct. \n\nYour mother is sexualizing you at a very young age. Her behavior is highly inappropriate. You're lucky to have a dad who looks out for you, it is not healthy for you to be with your mom. Parents are supposed to be parents not act like their teenaged children are their friends. \n\nYou did not get your mom in trouble, she got herself in trouble. She asked you to keep secrets which is extremely inappropriate. Think about it, if what she was doing was healthy and normal, why the need to keep it a secret? \n\nRather than wait for you to develop a natural curiosity, she pushed this topic on you. She is not teaching you healthy sexual development by buying you thongs - she teaching you that you're a thing for men to desire. You're not. You're a human being with a brain and dreams. \n\nThis is the reason your mother does not have any rights over you. She cannot be trusted to make good decisions and consider what is best for you.",
         "Your dad has good intentions, but he could have handled this a lot better. Here's what he didn't explain to you: \n\n1. You've done absolutely *nothing* wrong. You are a teenager that got sucked into a conflict between adults. You could not possibly have been expected to know the significance of hiding the items your mum gave you from your dad, especially because she \u2013 an adult that until now has been an authority figure \u2013 explicitly told you too. I would have done exactly the same in your position. It's understandable if you feel guilty, but please know that you don't *need* to feel guilty.   \n\n***\n\n\n2. Getting to know your body is perfectly normal at your age. Masturbation is a normal, healthy, private activity that no one else has any right to know anything about, and not something you should feel ashamed of. You never need to feel guilty about your body or your sexuality. That being said, \n\n***\n\n\n3. Your body and your sexuality are yours to explore and discover *on your own terms*. It is not okay for an adult to push you into topics or activities you don't feel comfortable with. You do not need to tell anyone anything about your sexuality, boys, girls, non-binary folks, your love life - unless there's an issue of safety or well-being. For example, if/ when you start having sex, it makes sense for you to discuss this with the adult(s) in your life you trust the most. That may or may not include your dad, teachers, or school councillors.\n\n***\n\n\n4. And just to be absolutely clear, **you've done absolutely nothing wrong**. These are things a reliable adult in your life should have already talked about. \n\n***\n\n5. Your mum is in the wrong here. Your dad is probably mad at her, and scared for your sake, and mad at himself for not doing more to protect you from sending up in this situation in the first place, and just doesn't know how to approach this. He's checking your phone to make sure she's not trying to reach out to you - although it's not clear that he's justified in making you keep your door open.\n\n***\n\n6. I would strongly recommend that you talk to your dad about seeing a therapist for yourself to work through what must be a very confusing and chaotic situation for you. See if he would be open to family therapy with just the two of you seeing a therapist together. If that's not an option, could you consider talking to a school councillor or another trusted adult at your school?",
         "Reading this and knowing your age scares me. Something is very wrong with mom. Her actions are not okay. \u00a0I say this as a sex positive person who understands teens have sexual urges. Your mom comes off like she is either trying to groom you for sexual contact (sell you for sex to someone) or has some weird psychological problem like she was repressed sexually as a young person and made to feel ashamed so she is overcompensating by introducing you to sexual things at an in appropriate age.\u00a0\n\nStay away from being alone with your mom. \u00a0Her actions are not appropriate. Also, it is extremely difficult to lose total custody of a child in the US. If your mom has lost custody then chances are very high her past actions were very bad. \u00a0\n\nYou can\u2019t fix your mom. You can\u2019t fix your dad\u2019s thoughts about your mom. \u00a0\n\nThe only thing you might be able to fix is your dad\u2019s thoughts about trusting you. \u00a0Tell him you didn\u2019t ask for that stuff and you were too embarrassed to show him and that\u2019s why you put it in the closet. That you realize now you should have gone to him no matter how embarrassing it was(fyi writing a letter or texting someone can help you say what is needed without having to be face to face with the person).\u00a0\nThat you would like to know more about your moms past history so you can know if this is one time incident or if she has a history of making bad decisions. Your mom need to be someone you love from a distance. Meaning your contact with her is limited for your own safety.\u00a0",
         "Your father is overreacting. For him to deny you privacy over this is drastic overreach.\n\nConversely, with the context in comments that you're only 14 years old, it is very understandable *why* he is overreacting like this. He might sincerely think that this is how far he has to go to ensure that your mother doesn't persist or escalate in her blatantly inappropriate behaviour. Especially with the buying you sexy underwear - I could come up with some plausible well meaning reason to supply masturbation aids to a teenager if forced at literal rifle point, but expensive sexy underwear, absofuckinglutely not.\n\nYou have not fallen short of what is reasonable to expect of a literal child of your age faced with the situation you describe. It would probably have been appropriate for you to betray your mother's trust by telling your father about her inappropriate gifts, but it is not reasonable to expect a teenager to have the experience and cunning necessary to determine on their own when it is appropriate to betray their caregiver's trust.\n\nI think you need to unpack this with your father as soon as you're ready. Do not attempt to contact your mother behind his back under the circumstances. I do not possess the words to describe just how far out of line she is while maintaining a remotely calm tone.",
         "Sweetheart, as a fairly unbreakable rule, if a grownup wants to talk to you about sexy stuff, and buy you intimate gifts, and they tell you to keep it secret from the person who looks after you (in your case, your dad), they *are not a safe grownup*. You didn't mess up, and your dad is angry with your mom, not with you. \n\nIt's probable, I think, that she is stupid-inappropriate rather than predatory-inappropriate, but she isn't behaving the way an adult should towards a young person, and your dad is likely making sure she is 100% clear on that before you can see each other again.\n\nI don't personally think he should make you keep your door open, but the reason for that, and for checking your phone, will be to make sure that neither your mom nor any other adult is being inappropriate with you.\n\nYou can't really fix it, because you haven't done anything wrong in the first place. It might help a bit if you can reassure your dad that you understand that an adult asking you to keep secrets around sex is a warning bell, and that you will treat it like one in the future.",
         "Yeah, tbh I\u2019d be furious if I were your dad. This is pretty much exactly why courts sometimes don\u2019t give one parent custody. \n\nI know it\u2019s not fun to hear, but your mom is WAY out of line, and what she did is very Not Okay. Your dad sees that and he\u2019s trying to protect you. \n\nI would just do what your dad says for now. Eventually, you may have to remind him that your mom did that and it made you uncomfortable. This is Not Your Fault. I think you dad knows that, but he doesn\u2019t know how else to protect you.",
         "This isn't your fault. Your mom is being WEIRD AS FUCK. Very inappropriate at your age, in my opinion. Your dad is probably just freaking out, bc this is kinda a big deal and really fucked up that your mom did that, so hopefully he'll calm down a little bit after a few days and when he's calm you migjt explain to him how uncomfortable it made you when she did that and that now you feel that you're at fault and see what he says",
         "I would ask if you can see a therapist.\n\nIf neither parent can be trusted, there might be a way of working out the no-door stuff with your father and therapist in the same room. It sounds like there's more to the story than you know, and a therapist might be able to help navigate that.",
         "I\u2019m a mom - also the daughter of a mom who acted like this. My dad got custody of me at 8 in the 80s so I get that side of it too. \n\nIt\u2019s super inappropriate and she shouldn\u2019t have gifted you a sex toy. It\u2019s just not \u2018normal\u2019 behavior for a mom IMO. \n\nI am sex positive where it\u2019s age and situation appropriate - no more and no less. I\u2019m not buying my daughter a sex toy or thongs etc. \n\nYou did nothing wrong telling your dad the truth. Your mom kind of messed up here and sometimes there\u2019s consequences and she\u2019s gonna have to pay those it seems.\n\nEdit to add: talk to dad and ask why you are being punished with the door when it\u2019s your mom who screwed up. You put all the junk in the closet and told him the truth when he asked. What did you do wrong here?",
         "OP, this would be different if you mom was approaching the subject of sex from the perspective of trying to educate you, teach you to have boundaries when it comes to bodily autonomy and consent and ways practice safe sex. But it doesn't sound like she's doing that AT ALL. It would be different if you had questions about sex and approached your mom with them to get a female perspective.... But again, it doesn't sound like that.\n\nI know this is going to sound odd. But if the genders were reversed and your mom was your dad, I would say that \"he\" was trying to groom you. It's not so different just because the genders are reversed. OP. **What your mom did was 100% sexually inappropriate**, it almost sounds like she's encouraging you or pushing you into having sexual experiences before YOU are ready.\n\nThis is not ok, OP. Your dad is 100% right to not let your mom see you anymore and if I were you, I would be wary. I probably wouldn't want to see her either.\n\nPlease take this seriously, because an unwanted pregnancy or a sex with the wrong person can really mess up your life and I am beyond disturbed that it is your mom doing this when her priority should be to educate and protect you.",
         "You don't try to fix this. Listen to your dad and let him handle it. Your mom was way out of line.",
         "You did nothing wrong. Your mom is pushing you to be someone you\u2019re not yet. That\u2019s not cool. It is entirely inappropriate for her to be buying you these things unprompted, I requested.\u00a0\n\nYour father is freaking out and overreacting. Give him time to cool down and get a hold of the situation. My stepkid is almost 14 and I would be very concerned if I thought they were being sexually active and unprepared.\u00a0",
         "Yeah. Your mom seems to be overstepping for a mother of a 14 year old who sees her a few times a month. Sounds like there is more/other concerning things she has probably done to lose your dad\u2019s trust. This feels gross",
         "Fourteen is, in my personal opinion, NOT at all an appropriate age for your mother to be buying you a sex toy. I can completely understand why your Dad lost it over this, I would be disgusted if my daughter's mother pushed sexual exploration onto her like that. It's one thing to talk about sex, you're of an age where a lot of kids do start to experiment and fool around, but it's another to go out and buy provocative underwear and toys that are not meant for children. They're called Adult Toys for a reason. \n\nI will say that it is not your job to fix this - in so much that you cannot. Your Dad has every right to be upset over this and I suspect your Mum knows damned well it wasn't the mature move to make here. I can't speak for her motivations, but it wasn't bought for you from good intentions. No sane parent would buy their fourteen year old a sex toy. \n\nYou haven't messed up. I'm sorry but this is all on your Mum for putting you in a position that you shouldn't be in. \n\nIf you do want to talk to your Dad, don't apologise because you've done nothing wrong. You were given gifts from a parent who is absent and didn't know what to do with them. Of course you didn't, you're a kid! Your Dad isn't angry at you, doesn't blame you. I suspect this will absolutely put a huge strain on whatever relationship he has with your mother, in terms of him letting you see her and I can understand that. \n\nYou did nothing wrong. I've said it before and I'll say it again because you will take this as something you did, but it wasn't you. It isn't a bad idea to take a break from seeing your Mum, which may not be easy to accept but if this is a woman who thought nothing of making such a purchase for her child, she clearly needs to learn that what she's done isn't appropriate.",
         "Totally, was your mother out of line for what she bought you but it possibly could be illegal. I\u2019m 99% sure and your mother would say is possibly grooming you. There was a reason why your parents divorced and I\u2019m willing to bet your father had a very good reason. Just a let alone ich factor Your mother was way out of line. I would ask your father. What was the cause of the divorce nine times out of 10? They do not give custody to the fathe not unless there\u2019s a very good reason, declaring the mother and an in parent. Just remember your father is trying to protect you and I will say it again. Ask your father why they were divorced.",
         "OP, your age makes your mother's behavior completely inappropriate.",
         "Emotional incest is real. It\u2019s traumatizing the same way physical incest is. It is not normal for a mom to give her 14 year old kid sex toys and/or lingerie. This is wildly inappropriate.",
         "You\u2019re 14 and your mom gave you a SEX TOY?? Can\u2019t say I disagree with your father\u2019s choice to keep your mom away from you. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair you\u2019re being punished for her decisions (especially taking the hinges off your door like a damn maniac), but those decisions are still wrong. You\u2019re too young to use any of those things and it sounds low key like grooming. This stuff is gross. Please listen to your father and stay away from your mother, but don\u2019t blindly follow your father, either.",
         "Is your father usually like that? Because, although what he did is not great, it seems he was acting out of tension because he knows your mother and he might be scared of something worse. If this is not his usual style, I would suggest trying a conversation once he is less angry/afraid. Your mother is really not the best person you have around, but your father needs to talk to you in a better manner about everything.",
         "Both of your parents are out of line here.  You should find a school counselor or some other adult who isn't related to you to confide in.",
         "Damn, 14? I think talking about it and considering birth control would be appropriate. Toys though? That\u2019s\u2026that\u2019s crossing the line. Your dad has a right to be furious. Mom needs to learn what is age appropriate. But I think that he needs to listen to you and consider the fact that you don\u2019t even invite any of those gifts and he should trust you more. Not having a door is extreme, especially since you really didn\u2019t do anything wrong. \n\nSorry OP what a mess you\u2019re in, at no fault of your own. Suggest family counseling and see if that\u2019s an option.",
         "You said in a comment that you're 14... it feels weird and inappropriate that your mom is giving you these things, especially as it doesn't sound like you really want them. \n\n\nBut it's also wrong that your dad is punishing you for what your mom did.  \n\n\nTell your dad that just because your mom gave you things that you weren't interested in and didn't know what to do with, doesn't mean that you aren't entitled to privacy any more. It sounds like he is already trying to talk to your mom about this. \n\n\nIt's really strange that your mom wasn't allowed to have unsupervised contact with you when you were younger -- does she have a history of doing inappropriate things, or maybe of having the type of boyfriends that aren't great for you to be around? I feel like that's an important part of the picture, even if it's something you don't want to talk about with Reddit strangers. \n\n\nIf your dad feels he needs to keep you safe from your mom, maybe he wants to make sure this doesn't escalate to your mom taking you to clubs or introducing you to guys who might take advantage of you. \n\n\nThis is a mess.  Is there anyone who knows your mom and dad that you can talk to?",
         "Good to see these answers here. Child being exposed to sexual behaviour by a parent inappropriately.",
         "It takes a lot for a parent that wants some custody time to lose all custody. There is definitely a lot more to the story and likely your father is trying to protect you from it. He may be taking the protection bit a bit too far by taking away your privacy, but I\u2019m inclined to give him the benefit of the doubt since he\u2019s the one that has consistently shown up for you. It may be that he realized letting you see your mom unsupervised was a mistake on his part and now he\u2019s over correcting.\n\nYour mom however is extremely inappropriate. I\u2019m sorry to say, but any teenage girl that sees their mom as the cool mom has a mom that isn\u2019t really parenting. Part of being a good parent means you\u2019re inevitably going to be seen as uncool for the boundaries you set for your teenager. No matter how old you are, having your mother insist you should wear thongs is not ok, but especially at your age. You\u2019re allowed to take your time growing up. It definitely is a good idea to take a break from that relationship and maybe speak to a therapist about how to navigate it because the way your mom is approaching it is unhealthy. And also as the non-custodial parent, she should never be telling you to hide things from the custodial parent. That\u2019s a major red flag.",
         "Your mom is feeling bad about the living situation and wants to be your cool friend rather than a parent. She put you in a bad situation. You need to talk to your dad and explain that his reaction to an uncomfortable situation is making things worse for you. He needs to discuss this with your mom while supporting you.",
         "It's creepy of your mother to give those things to you. She's sexualising you. Your dad's reaction is pretty understandable. It's not up to you to fix this, it's up to your parents. You don't need to do a thing. I'm so sorry you're in this situation.",
         "It sounds like your dad is trying to keep you safe and  I admire that. At the same time, you need a safe place to mature into adulthood in your own time, what\u2019s the rush? Do you have another woman in your life you can talk to, like an aunt?  How do you feel about the adult toy and thongs your mother gave you ?\nIt sounds like your mom is introducing you to sex rather than you leading the conversation, which I believe is backwards. Her job is to listen and support, not to initiate your sexuality. Try to enjoy just being a young adult, curious about the world and how it works.",
         "You don't need to fix this, your dad and mum need to. It may seem harsh, but your dad is protecting you as your mum shouldn't be asking you to keep secrets from him as the custodial parent, and she should be talking to him and in agreement between them both before she decides to action forward on a decision. \n\nDivorce is never fun, and there are always two sides to the story. To make co-parenting work after a divorce requires good communication between both parents regardless who the children live with, exactly the same as married and all living together. \n\nIt's natural to feel bad and sad, but you didn't do anything wrong here and you're stuck between your parents sorting this out. It sounds a bit like your dad may be going over the top with the no closed door/checking your phone on the regular. \n\nWhat you can optionally do, let your dad know that while he and your mum need to discuss what happened and come to an agreement to move forward with, this has left you feeling <state how you feel>. The key here is you shouldn't be made to feel guilty or untrusted in this, given your age and how your mum approached this. Take accountability in the discussion (e.g. I know that mum said not to tell you, and I know that I should have, and I'm sorry for not telling you), and it might help your dad realise that he is over focused on trust with you when you're as much of a victim of your mum's actions.",

I can see why she doesn't have custody and your dad is protecting you and I wouldn't let you talk to your mom either.  Christ, it sounds like she's grooming you to pimp out...maybe set you up with an onlyfans page to generate her some cash. \n\nsmh...you're 14.  I raised 4 daughters and I would not ever ever ever buy my 14 year old, presumed virgin daughter, a dildo to use.  jesus\n\nThe secrecy makes this ALL skeevy, and that's how you know its wrong.",
         "Mom of a teen here - your dad is blowing this WAY out of proportion. Look at the result - you feel bad and sad because of it and *you* have not done anything; sex and shame is a destructive combination. I'm not saying he shouldn't feel icky about it- parents commonly want to remain ignorant about their kids growing up. I'm aware on a daily basis(!) that my stewardship of my kid where they were the center of my world is slowly coming to an end. I was devastated the first day of pre-k, I'll be devastated the day they move out lol\n\nHe needs to have a CALM conversation with your mother. I hope your mother also impressed upon you that these things will be there for you w*hen you're ready*. Grow at your own pace because adulthood isn't going anywhere. \n\nNot allowed to close your door is ridiculous. All its going to do is make you afraid to trust him. As if he thinks if he doesn't lock you'll up you'll go from a child to a floozy\\* overnight. The best thing he can do is remain dependable and encourage your patience, awareness and self confidence - the kind of thing that allows you to make meaningful choices and avoid getting taken advantage of by others. \n\nIs there another female adult you can speak to? An aunt or someone that can be a neutral party \n\n\\* no disrespect intended to the flagrantly sexually active",

It\u2019s never ok for an adult to ask you to keep secrets. Ever. I see where she\u2019s coming from, but mom was woefully underprepared and didn\u2019t hit the mark with trying to have an age appropriate discussion about your body and sexuality. All of your feelings are valid! I would love for you to start seeing a really good therapist or even school counselor regularly to help you navigate all of this. Your parent\u2019s should be trying to find ways to support you and that\u2019s a great start! I\u2019m sorry your dad lost control of his big emotions in front of you, that\u2019s wasn\u2019t ok. Its always ok to discuss your body and sexuality questions with a therapist/counselor. They can be much better equipped than a lot of well meaning parents to handle those tricky discussions. Good luck to you!",
         "Dad should have definitely taken this up with Mom instead of punishing you. Teens have a right to privacy within reason, and having a door to your bedroom is more than reasonable. You haven\u2019t done anything wrong. To be honest it would be better to speak about this to a therapist if possible. \n\nI would also recommend that you remind your dad that taking your door off its hinges is also behavior that makes you uncomfortable. Same talk with mom for giving you age-inappropriate gifts. Maybe ask them to sit down together with you so you can tell them how YOU feel about this. Especially if therapy isn\u2019t in the cards for whatever reason. But if you can get them to do a family session with you that would be even better since you\u2019d have a therapist to mediate and make sure you got to say your full and honest piece.",

And taking the entire background story in consideration, I think your mother was way out of line and I cannot understand why she would introduce things to you this way. I can understand your fathers feelings but he should not really be taking those out on you though.",

You're craving a relationship, and to know your mother loves you, are 100% normal natural things to feel. It's not a thinking thing. It's emotional, easily untethered from logic. And more a thing that happens to people than a thing that people choose to do.\n\nYour mom has been sexually and emotionally abusing you. She shrouded it in \"just us girls\" secrecy, manipulating your desire for an emotionally intimate relationship with your mom and your being completely blindsided and unprepared for her intrusions on your safety, privacy, autonomy and comfort. Whatever her motivation, she has subjected you to unwanted exposure to sexual practices and images with no regard for your readiness, consent, or vulnerability.\n\nIt's normal and okay to learn about how bodies work and how sex works at your own pace and comfort level. Sweetie, no adolescent's comfort level is a parent injecting porn props into a young teen's life under cover of \"sharing our mom-daughter secrets.\" Your feelings are valid and 100% grounded in reality. \n\nYou have the right to discuss or not anything about your life, at your comfort level. It can be very confusing when the person violating normal healthy boundaries is a person we are highly focused on and invested in. \n\nGood job telling your dad. That shame, fear, guilt, doubt and hurt you feel are the results of your mother's abuse. Don't believe you are particularly different or unloved or broken because you feel so, terribly deeply so, right now. A very bad thing has happened to you. You are wounded.

Your dad may not be perfect, but I'd freak the fuck out if I found out that ANY girl your age was provided with a sex toy by a non-custodial parent. Listen, we ALL masturbate, it is absolutely normal, BUT! your mom giving you a dildo introduces a \"grooming\" element here and your dad is right to be concerned. Here's the thing, YOU didn't approach your mom for this kind of intervention, SHE brought it up. And you were clearly not ready for that kind of sex talk. As an older mom, I  would ABSOLUTELY have words with your mom, and I would ABSOLUTELY limit your contact with her. This is grooming behavior, please let your dad protect you. You did NOTHING wrong. Your mom created this entire drama, please take that into account. You should be able to spend time with your mother without feeling responsible for her or defending her, that is not normal or healthy.\n\nEdit: Your dad is wrong to rob you of your privacy and to not let you close your door. He is reflexively over-reacting, and blaming the victim, and that's not cool. He needs to deal with your mom, you are not the problem.

She might be trying to manufacture a \u201cspecial bond\u201d where you feel like only she \u201cgets it\u201d and think she\u2019s being cool, so that you would want to see her more than your dad currently lets you.

You're still young enough to shop in the kids section. Your dad is trying to protect you from another adult forcing you to be sexual when you're not ready. Unfortunately, that adult is your mom. I do think he should be letting you close your door because you deserve privacy, but he's probably afraid your mom might try to contact you behind his back. Please don't try to contact your mom until your dad says it's safe. I know it really sucks not being able to talk to her or see her but she's clearly not a safe adult for you to be around.

You don\u2019t want your relationship to be strained. I would advise apologizing for not telling him right away and making sure he knows that you were uncomfortable with what your mother did! \n\nI can understand why he doesn\u2019t want to give your mother unfettered access to you with her behavior. If you really want to see her again you could always ask if you could see her while he is there too. Or if he has a trusted female who could be there on the visits. And if he lets you I would also say to tell your mother you were very uncomfortable with what she did!! \n\nI hope it gets easier as time passes.",
         "You did nothing wrong and is not your responsibility to fix anything. They are the adults and they should act like it. It seems they are fighting a war and you are caught in between which sadly happens a lot though it shouldn't be. But you are at fault for nothing of this. \n\nYour dad is only right in one thing that your mom overstepped boundaries. But those were your boundaries and not his. She has no right to urge you to things like that. A talk about dangers and safety and boundaries or wishes is important at your age but she shouldn't urge you to try or use or wear anything.\n\nHowever your dad's behaviour is completely unacceptable as well. Checking your phone is a deep breach into your personal space. Nothing you did could even begin to justify something so drastic.\n\nI understand you didn't but even if you did use or want to use the things your mother gave you that wouldn't warrant such reaction. There is nothing wrong with those items or their uses.",
         "As other people have pointed out... both of your parents are wrong here. Not sure what your mom is trying to do here with you being 14... but it's kinda fucked up regardless of the intent. It would be different if you'd gone to her about it. And your dad's reaction is borderline gross and his \"temporary measures\" are victim blaming to boot. You didn't ASK your mom for any of that, so why is he putting it on you? And if you HAD? Then he DEFINITELY is out of line. It's understandable for him to be upset about it given what your mom did, but he shouldn't be putting ANYTHING on you.",
         "When you are an adult, and you have a daughter/child, I have a feeling you are going to truly understand why your dad reacted the way he did, and understand how he is reasonable. \n\nYour mom, while likely well-intentioned, has overstepped a boundary with you that is really not okay. If you had asked your mom for these items because he were ready to explore and felt comfortable talking to her about it, that's one thing. What you've described could literally be considered a crime, OP. And that's for a reason. \n\nI want to reiterate, I know you love your mom and you know that she meant well. Sometimes well-intentioned people are hurt/messed up a little, and they can in turn hurt/overstep boundaries of others. Your dad is doing the right thing by protecting you, figuring out the situation, and it sounds like the no contact is not a forever thing.",
         "Your parents are both pretty awful. With your mom, it's a type  of sexual abuse, like emotional incest. I'm sure she and your dad split because she was the \"wild child\" in their marriage and he was the \"strict, disapproving parent.\" So this is her way of thumbing her nose at him, and she's setting off all his alarm bells, thinking that you're going to follow in her footsteps. I'm not crazy about his snooping through your closet -- what was THAT all about? BOTH of them are violating your boundaries, which you have a right to.\n\nI assume your father confiscated the stuff your mom gave you, which is too bad, because you could pack them up and mail them back to her, saying your sexuality is YOURS to explore in your own time. But to get your dad off your back, you could write her a letter to that effect, let him read it and mail it. Tell him he doesn't have to worry about you going wild (if that's the issue with your mother) because you have been raised differently than she was. You might want to avoid visits with your mother, who seems sketchy. I hope your father will back off.",
         "Sounds like you are being groomed by your mother.",
         "Ohhhhhh, honey, your father is correct. You being 14 is just icky and suggests she thinks if you get pregnant she will have control over your life. I'd ask her to back off and I wouldn't ask nicely either. Establish a boundary she doesn't realize should be there.",
         "your mom and dad are both being weird about these things. your mom's gifts are not appropriate for your age or relationship with her, and your dad drastically curtailing your privacy because of those gifts is not fair to you. you haven't done anything wrong. you should reach out to another trusted adult like a therapist to help you navigate this situation in person, but in the meantime you did well by reaching out to the adults here for advice. the most important thing to understand is that you haven't messed anything up or done anything wrong, you only tried your best to do the right and respectful thing with unwanted gifts.",
         "It might not seem this way to you yet, but what your mom did was extremely inappropriate and almost dangerous behavior. This entire conversation would be different if you asked for these items but you did not. For now, I think it best if you let the trustworthy adult in your life - your dad - handle the issue directly with your mom and for you to take a step back. But know that you have done nothing - and I mean absolutely nothing - wrong. \n\nNow as to the issue with your dad, I would talk to him about it. It's not that he doesn't trust you, but I think he got a very real reminder that there are people out there who will exploit your trust and innocence if he's not there to protect you so he's getting overly protective. With that, I would talk to him. Ultimately, you can talk to him about better understanding boundaries. And about knowing when to talk to him, and when things can be kept privately for yourself. But the reality is, he can't be there at all times in everything that you do and you may be in need of tools to better inform your future judgment.\n\nI am sorry your parents put you in this position. But please, please know you really haven't done anything wrong. The fact that you reached a conclusion - that maybe you should have brought it up to your dad sooner - is great. But the instinct that maybe you should have just thrown it away is exactly why you might be in need of a bit more guidance. \n\nGrowing up is hard - and it is immeasurably harder when you don't have a great, solid example to follow. But you're doing it so don't fret. This too will blow over. And if there are changes that happen to your relationship with your mom, it's because of your mom and not because of anything you did.",
         "Step 1. write you all your thoughts on the whole situation, from start to finish. This subject can feel really icky at your age, and you may be inclined to ignore and repress instead of inspect those feelings. If you want to communicate with your parents, you are going to need to first understand what it is that you want to say.\n\n(I'm giving you prompts to ask your self questions, but do not respond to me with the answers. these are just for you to think about.)\n\nFor instance, how did you feel when your mom gave you the gift? Scared? Nervous? What did you think would happen if you accepted them? What did you think would happen if you had refused? Why was accepting them the best choice, between the two?\n\nhow did you feel when your dad confronted you? Afraid he would stop loving you if he thought you were sexually active? Afraid you might not see your mom again?\n\nStep 2. Understand what is your fault and what is not. It's not your fault that your mom gave you a sex toy, so you have nothing to apologize for. So don't explain. Nothing you can do.\n\nYou did make a choice to accept the gift though, and then to keep if from your dad. These are the parts you talk about.\n\nDid you feel trapped without any good answer when you encountered these decisions? If you felt trapped in these conversations with your mom, then THAT PART is the part that needs to be worked out. That part is the root of the problem. And with your dad, if you are afraid of his actions, voice that you are afraid of him, and ask for reassurance that you have nothing to fear.\n\nThis is an example of how a convo with you dad could go (though your actual feelings will have to drive the real conversation.) Write it down and then you can either give it to him, or read it out loud.\n\n\"I have some things to tell you about that are really important. And because they are important, i wrote them down so io would not leave out anything. Please listen to the whole thing first and then we can go back to each.\n\nDad, i appreciate that you are looking out for me. The truth is, you are right; I'm not grown up enough yet for those gifts. I knew that i wasn't, which was why i didn't use them. I hope you can see how i was able to protect my boundaries, and i can be trusted to be responsible. But i also cherish my relationship with mom, and i feel i want to connect over *something.* I didn't want to hurt her feelings, and I should have just told her I wasn't ready yet. Maybe if we had some other things to bond over, i wouldn't have felt like i had to lie to her. I understand why we need a time out from mom, but maybe after, you could help mom learn some of the things you already know i like, and we can try to bond again over those things.\n\nI understand why you feel you have to protect me, but it makes me sad that you do not trust me anymore, and won't let me have my door. I was stuck between two parents i love very much and i feel like anything i would have done would have been the wrong thing. So i also don't know what i can do to regain your trust. I wish i would have told you, but i felt you would blame me or get mad at me, or take my mom away. You feel like you can;t trust me, but the truth is, i don;t think i can trust you either. And i need to hear from you that you will love me no matter what. And that you would have helped mom bond with me better instead of taking her away from me. And that you would have still loved me even if i had been using those things.\"",
         "Seriously, I think your mom is pushing boundaries and being overly sexual.\u00a0\n\n\nShe could tell you about periods and answer questions as you develop and have them. However, pushing lingerie and sex on a teen is not something that should be done.\n\n\nIt almost feels like she is prepping you to work. I think your dad is right here.\n\n\nYou have not done anything wrong. He is protecting you. I don't know how safe your mom is to be around.\u00a0\n\n\nGrow up at your own rhythm.",
         "I\u2019m a dad and if I had that same situation, I probably would\u2019ve handled it just as inappropriately. I think he (I would) will calm down in short time. You did nothing a normal teen wouldn\u2019t have done, you aren\u2019t the problem. \n\nYour parents obviously have issues and some of the anger directed at you should really be directed at your mother. Her wanting to discuss sex, boys, etc should be age appropriate and shouldn\u2019t include toys and revealing clothing unless YOU requested them.",
         "The moment your mom told you not to tell your dad, he became justified in his reaction. If an adult tells you to keep secrets from one of your parents, especially in regards to sex and your body, that is a red flag.  There are a few exceptions to this rule (all having to do with how safe the other parent is). But nothing about your post points to dad being abusive or against your autonomy.\n\nThis is weird activity from your mom. It is one thing to be open and engaged with your teenager. Another to be forcing them to explore in such specific ways",
         "Seems like your mom is immature and inappropriate. Your dad shouldn\u2019t be reacting the way he is but it\u2019s common for dads to be funny about these things. Please remember that there is nothing to be ashamed about exploring your sexuality as you grow up. You shouldn\u2019t feel pressured to share things with your parents and they shouldn\u2019t ask any more than to know you are safe. Your mom and dad fighting is not about you - it\u2019s about them. Just like if you had a partner it would be on you to nourish your relationship or your friendships. I am sorry you are in such an awkward position.",

Talk to your dad if it helps about your feelings.",

Yikes I can see why Dad\u2019s a bit upset because it was very inappropriate. \n\nHe is the custodial parent and should be the one deciding what you\u2019re ready for. \nSpeak to your Dad and explain that you never asked for any of these gifts.  \n\nI hope he spoke to your mom about it. And you\u2019ll be able to talk to her soon",
         "I'm so glad you were able to tell your dad. I'm sorry he reacted so hard. He is definitely trying to protect you from all of this and let you be a kid. Try to have a talk with him after he calms down",
         "Do you have a trusted relative that you can speak to about this? \n\nYour mom buying you these things at 14 feels sketchy. Her telling you to keep it a secret from your dad feels really really sketchy. \n\nYour dad checking your phone and telling you not to close the door is overprotective and unreasonable. If you're a good kid and have always been a good kid and never given him a reason to distrust you, there's no reason to start now just because your mom decided to be.. I'll just say weird for the moment. \n\nYou shouldn't be punished for it. \n\nYou need someone who you trust to advocate for you. Because I think your parents are so busy trying to get at each other that they're putting you in the crossfire. Do you have an auntie you can rely on? \n\nAunties are cool with stuff like this and if you trust them they'll be able to back you up. There's no reason to punish you. Especially because you did nothing wrong. Not really. At least. Maybe you should have told your dad but this obviously made you terribly uncomfortable. Your dad's just setting himself up to not be a reliable person to speak to about things like this. And your mom..... I'm okay with a mom being Open with their child about these things. But to outright give you sex, toys and sexy underwear that you didn't even ask for.\n\nI asked my mom, once, about getting a thong. After that... Never again. Not because of anything she did, I found thongs terribly uncomfortable. I told her and she goes ' Okay, now we know'. \n\nAs a kid you should be able to go to your parents and be able to talk comfortably about these things. But it should come from you. You should be the one to initiate the conversation, not being pulled into the conversation.\n\n\nBut I have a deeper feeling that there is a lot more to this than you know. With that being the case, I'm sorry to tell you, there might not be anything to fix. I don't know if you have the type of family dynamic where you can go to your dad and say \"Dad, I would like to have an adult conversation with you about this situation\" and then tell him how you feel. \n\nOr if you need a trusted family member to be a moderator for that conversation. \n\nBut I truly feel that whatever is going on with the situation you are caught in the crosshairs. If your parents aren't careful, you will end up as collateral damage. No kid should be caught in the middle between their parents' relationship.",
         "Both of your parents are out of line, but for very different reasons. For your mom, it's one thing to know your daughter is in puberty and will be curious about sexual things. It's healthy to start the conversation early before the possibility of sexual activity so you know what to do and how to be safe. When I was a teen the first thing I explored was myself, but I grew up in a very conservative house where any sex talk was forbidden, so I just had to figure it out for myself. So in theory it's OK that she wanted to have that talk with you. What is NOT ok is her buying you sex toys and thongs that you didn't ask for, and telling you to keep it secret from your dad. Never trust an adult who tells you to keep secrets from your trusted guardians. It's one thing if you wanted those things and asked her for them and then she could have a healthy discussion about the proper use of toys for self pleasure and that fancy underwear is worn for ourselves and not for others' enjoyment. But she didn't do that. All that combined with her history and lack of custody tells me that your dad is right as far as being concerned about her behavior around you. \n\nAs for your dad, he has GROSSLY overreacted to the situation and is punishing you for your mom's actions. You're a kid, you love your mom, you took the things she gave you and brought them home and kept them secret because she told you to. You did nothing wrong. He is now violating your privacy and trust due to his anger and lack of trust toward your mom. He needs to remember that his job is to protect and nurture his child as they grow INTO an adult, and his job is literally to prepare you for adulthood. Burying his head in the sand and pretending you'll never have sex is not a healthy approach for anyone. Forcing you to keep your door open as a girl who needs privacy in her teens is the opposite of what he should have done. He needs to quickly change his approach or he is going to push you away. Not to mention the guilt you already feel and how that will translate to your mindset when it comes to anything sexual in the future. He needs to focus on healthy parenting, for the sake of his child.\n\nYOU do not need to fix anything. You did not do anything wrong. Your parents are both acting like immature children, in wildly different ways. Your mom's behavior is more concerning generally, but your dad's behavior has a more immediate and negative impact on your life. You should seek out a trusted adult or school counselor to talk this out. Get resources for how to process the situation, and how to approach conversations with each of your parents. You're approaching a time where your body is going to be changing and hormones will be going wild and it's best you get a hold on this now before you're in a place of acting on emotion like they are. \n\nThe only thing you can do now is sit each of them down, explain how they hurt you (mom by giving you inappropriate items you didn't ask for and telling you to keep secrets from dad, and dad for misplaced punishments and going scorched earth over a situation you didn't even ask to be a part of, and especially for violating your privacy and making you feel like you've done something wrong when you are a confused kid who is just trying to do right by her parents. Tell them both you need THEM to be the adults here) and set expectations for how you'd like things to go moving forward (mom - let me approach topics I want to discuss with you, and don't put me in a position to be dishonest with my father, and consider having more appropriate interactions with me moving forward, dad - I am growing and changing and need you to nurture me as your child with love and compassion and calm discussion about concerns, versus flying off the handle and violating my personal agency, and also I want you to discuss conflicts with mom directly versus involving me in your anger, and also I want to continue having a healthy relationship with you but if you continue to have a closed minded approach to my puberty and eventual sexuality, I won't be able to be as open with you. I would like to have the comfort of knowing I can come to you about anything and know you will be my SAFE place even if I make mistakes).\n\nAnd idk maybe consider college away from home. Good luck OP.",
         "That\u2019s extremely weird of your mom if you\u2019re 14. Or any age.",
         "Ok 14, fuggging in appropriate in sooo many ways. \n\nYou deserve to be a kid. A teen. You can talk about sex but your mom teaching you how to pleasure yourself with toys is not cool. She can talk about it in a educational way at some point but my mom did crap like this and I had a horrible perspective of boundaries",
         "Hey, this is not your fault. You did nothing wrong. Your mom was being deeply inappropriate for your age. Your dad should not blame you, but it\u2019s reasonable for him to restrict access to your mom. Your mom may have been trying to use these attention seeking behaviors to control you. But in healthy families, no one ever asks children to keep secrets. Ask your dad if he can help you find a therapist who specializes in toxic parent relationships. You deserve support and acceptance from at least one adult in your life. And\nknow you\u2019re not alone even when things are hard, and there are people in the world who will love you as you are someday.",
         "Why does it feel like your mom is grooming you for sex trafficking what the actual hell\u2026? This is terrifying",
         "Sorry, that your mother put you in this position. And that your father has reacted the way he has. Do you have a school counselor you can talk to about your family situation? Find out from school what you can discuss with a school counselor. Maybe try to talk to a helpline for teenagers. Or a helpline for women. They may have qualified counselors.",
         "I feel like your parents both crossed a boundary they shouldn't cross with you, but your mom even moreso. What she's doing is highly troubling and makes it sound like she's grooming you. Your dad just shouldn't have gone through your closet or freaked out about finding a sex toy. Neither of their behaviors are good parenting, imo.",
         "I just want to begin by saying, you did nothing wrong here.  There is nothing for you to fix and I would let your parents talk this out.  With that said.\n\nI agree with your father on most things you said here.  I saw you post that you are 14.  You should learn about sex and your own sexuality, but at your own pace and only engage with others when you feel ready and comfortable.  Anyone, parents included, pushing sex unto you does not have your best interests at heart.  It\u2019s ok to explore and it\u2019s ok to learn.  That isn\u2019t the problem here.  It\u2019s the way it happened, not the reasoning itself.  The \u201cwhy\u201d is just as important as the \u201chow\u201d.\n\nNow your father.  I think he is overall a kind man from what you\u2019ve described.  He wants to protect you from someone he considers a bad influence, but he also wants you to have a relationship with your mother.  I applaud most of his actions, I don\u2019t agree with him bad mouthing your mother and twisting his experiences unto your relationship with her, I can understand his reasoning.  My parents are divorced.  My mother, married a childhood friend who ended up cheating on her multiple times and married his best friend\u2019s wife (after the divorce).  She never once stopped me and my sisters from seeing him, she never once bad mouthed him, any adult conversation was between her and him.  They had equal custody and he basically won the participation award by doing the bare minimum.  My mother wanted her children to have a relationship with their father.  It was up to him to ruin the relationship, not her.  She ultimately let us decide and when she felt we were ready she would answer our questions about the reason they got divorced.  That is how you parent.  \n\nI think you are a smart girl and kind girl who knows right from wrong, but just need some validation on the path forward.  Let your parents dish it out and trust that your father has your best interests at heart, but be wary of him being over protective as well.  You are 14, you are old enough to have opinions, but it\u2019s ok to ask for help in sifting through complex situations like this.  Just tackle things with a level head, understand that not everyone has your best interests at heart, and form opinions for yourself.  You got this :)",
         "I am sorry to say this. But don't trust your mother with anything. She is your mother that will not change. You can spend some time together. But never try to get too personal. She is trying to pull you to somewhere that could ruin your life. And your dad is just trying to protect you. Give him some time.",
         "Mom is weird, giving you things that make you uncomfortable before you are mature enough to use them. Of course she wanted you to keep it a secret from your dad. Dad is trying to protect you.",
         "I don't exactly like the part when the dad is going through the closet of a 14 year old. That's not a little child anymore. Teens need personal spaces. \n\nI understand that the mom is in the wrong giving a 14 year old sexual things. It's good that the dad is trying to protect the kid, but going through her personal stuff and berating her is not the right way at all.",
         "Personally, I think this is highly disturbing behavior on your mom\u2019s part and I\u2019m sure there is an ulterior motive. \n\nYour dad is 100% in the right and is doing what\u2019s best to protect you. I think the open door and checking phone is just a temporary thing as he\u2019s probably still wrapping his head around the situation.\n\nYour dad likely has full custody for a reason and has more insight into your mom than you do. The relationship with your dad will likely repair itself, just give it up. And keep an open line of communication with him.",
         "I mean between 14-16 you probably should start figuring out what you like, before you\u2019re doing anything with boys.\u00a0\n\n\nYou can\u2019t tell or show someone else what you like if you don\u2019t know - but no one tells a lot of girls that and they get railroaded when they start dating and being told what they should like.\u00a0\n\n\nHowever I\u2019d think a couple books and a gentle vibrator are the most a mom should provide. Lingerie is a bit much. Dad needs to deal though. You need to know and own your sexuality and desires, not have them be owned by your father, boyfriend, or husband.\u00a0\n\n\nYour mom might be concerned if she knows your dad is like this.\u00a0\n\n\nAlso open door? He has to sleep sometime so if you were determined, the door wouldn\u2019t make a different.\u00a0",
         "I feel like you could make an argument that your mother is trying to make your life easier with the toy, as teenagers will explore themselves and it could be seen as her just trying to help with frustration while saying do whatever you need to be happy.\n\nthe underwear is definitely way over the line though, like that's crossing over from \"you do you, use this if it helps\" to  \"wear this to look good for your hookups\"\n\nmaybe I'm weird in finding the underwear the super weird part, and I think you should probably think critically on your own what kind of behavior buying those items is meant to encourage. Dad doesn't seem off the mark here as he found everything as you said, and they together do not paint a good picture of what your mother is doing. Taking the door is definitely extreme, but its hard to blame that reaction given what he found for someone that underage.\n\nMaybe its best if you do spend time away from your mother for a while.",
         "Sound alike your dad's assessment of your mother spot on. She tries to be the cool one without responsibilities.\n\n\nAt 14 you are free to buy stuff like sex toys and underwear if you want it. Giving it to you without being asked is a bad move.\u00a0\nHowever I do not think you did anything wrong. You took it, put it in your drawer and left it there. Talking about everything with everyone is a bit much to ask for.\n\n\nMaybe be open about it with your father that you didn't have any questions and know it is weirdo but you value the time with your mother and did have no intention of using any of it and therefore out it away. Assure him that if you actually have questions you would ask him, you just don't have anything on your mind right now (assuming that this is true).\nTry to navigate a way that he trusts your judgement also, you can frame it that way. You know your mother is not always doing trat things but you want contact and he should trust you to not do stupid things. Maybe assure him to tell him more about what is going on moving forward.\u00a0\n\n\nThis seems a pretty complicated situation, I hope you can resolve it in a way that is acceptable to everyone involved, but mainly for you.",
         "If you're a teen I don't think the sextoy is a that weird, the undies feel weird though. But if you're a teen I think you should be allowed to decide yourself if you want to see her, I can understand your father but I don't think it's okay by him either to control that. Okay I don't know what the laws are where you live and if you can decide to see her even if he says know. I wonder though why she lost custody, if it was something serious then I suppose your father should be able to say know. But generally I think a teen should decide themselves if they want some contact and your father sounds bit too controlling but I can understand his concern too depending on why she lost custody.\n\nI don't think you should keep things like this as a secret from your father though even if you may not want to lose contact with your mother.",
         "Your mom\u2019s obsession with hypersexualizing you is not good. Yes, at 14 you will be exploring. On your own, in your own way. Totally normal.

She sounds juvenile\u2026wanting you to hang/party with her friends and gossip about boys with you.

It\u2019s a difficult situation to read but having a calm conversation with your dad is probably the best start.",
         "Yeah although your mother is on very thin ice on whether or not it was a creepy thing that she did, the door removal was a shit move on your father's part. Honestly you need to wait for him to cool off a bit then have a talk with him.",
         "There should be no secrets kept from your dad.",
         "Your mother is an AH; your father too.",
         "It's not your job to fix this, but I would suggest that you tell your dad that your mom's is also your parent and she also has the right to parent you.  He doesn't have to like what your mom is doing and he also doesn't have to like what you are doing.  He needs to chill out, seriously.",
         "Yep\u2014my mom started doing this to alienate my dad at close to this age. But she bought me cigarettes at 15 and talked about smoking weed in high school and how normal it was.\n\nGood call out. Took me a few years into adulthood to really unravel the issues with it.",
         "Sorry, I'm 14. I'll put that on the post too.",
         "Yeah, I agree. It\u2019s difficult to say exactly what mom\u2019s motivation is here but it\u2019s odd at best. I get wanting your kids to be open with you, hoping they will keep you posted on important developments including sex related things. I can also see a particularly open mother and daughter shopping for adult toys together or buying them for each other, when both parties are adults. \n\nOP, this is not meant to be disrespectful to you, but you\u2019re too young for that imo. Your dad is likely really upset and confused. It\u2019s not right (again imo) for you to be in any trouble over this, but I understand his feelings. He\u2019s concerned and confused and wants to know what your mom was thinking to make it ok in her mind before he lets you be alone with her again. Because you\u2019re a minor and giving you a sex toy that you can\u2019t legally buy yourself is odd behavior. He wants to know she\u2019s making good decisions for you. But he should sit down with you and explain what he\u2019s thinking himself, because I\u2019m willing to bet almost all of his frustration is with your mom. \n\nTLDR: Adults are just old kids, they\u2019re definitely not perfect, not even your parents. Mom\u2019s behavior is worth questioning. Dad is justified in being upset but he shouldn\u2019t take it out on you",
         "I'm so sorry OP You are caught in the crossfire between trenches, your parents need to end that proxy war. It's not your fault, you did the best you could",
         "In the future, please do not approach these situations by asking the OP to admit their age. You know the creeps who lurk on this sub. The kid could get preyed on.\n\nYes, the age changes things and it is relevant, but if you had removed the line \"Your current age needs to be part of this.\u00a0\" you still would have been able to impart the exact same advice (\"If this age, then X, but if that age, then Y\") without OP potentially getting DM harassment.",
         "And why would dad be snooping around his young daughter's closet to find hidden pieces of underwear? Barring my husband, I would be extremely uncomfortable if even my mom or dad opens my closet to look at my underwear, and they would also feel the same way.",
         "It\u2019s better than her going out and experimenting with guys. Kids are sexual from birth in their own exploratory ways. It\u2019s better to be open and honest about development, and her dad is stuck in denial about her maturing. He needs to respect privacy and boundaries-I see why your mom divorced him. Too authoritarian.",
         "OP, I suspect there's a reason your dad has full custody that you don't know about. Her actions here are inappropriate (though you do still deserve a door). You might go to your dad and tell him anything he doesn't already know about wrt your mom's contact with you, and then ask if there's anything you don't know about her that you should.",

The kid could get preyed on.\n\nYes, the age changes things and it is relevant. You should instead just be upfront with your assessment in the first place. For instance:\n\n\"If you were between X-Y years old, i would say... but if Y-Z, then i believe...\" This allows you to impart your conditional advice while also protecting OP.",

         "As parents, we definitely have a responsibility to violate our children's privacy some of the time. Would you still be against him looking through her things if these gifts had been from Kyle, the third time high-school senior she visits after school?  \n\nTaking off the door isn't a good response though.",
         "Op, this is good advice. I'd like to reiterate that it is normal to start being curious about sex at your age but also totally normal to not have any interest in it yet. Don't let anyone pressure you into doing things you are not ready for. \n\nAnd you did nothing wrong. Your parents sound like they have some opposing opinions on this topic.",
         "Good point. My kids\u2019 conservative dad asked me to make sure to talk to the girls about masturbation. I brought it up and said if they wanted to get a vibrator, I\u2019d order it for them. I\u2019m sure they\u2019d be too embarrassed to ask me to do that, though. I most definitely wouldn\u2019t buy them thong underwear, unless we were shopping for clothes and they asked.",
         "Thank you very much...!",
         "I\u2019m guessing it wasn\u2019t redirected anger but just anger that she thinks was directed at her. Because kids do that a lot. \n\nHell, adults do it too. I don\u2019t like people angry around me and I often think it\u2019s directed at me even when it\u2019s just the person venting or being angry in general.\n\nI agree with your advice!",
         "Imho a good egg would take her door and privacy away like that. That's a big red flag from the dad in my book as well.",
         "WHAT? why would a mother do this",
         "As another teacher and mandatory reporter I was previously planning to write this exact same thing. We both would be required to report your mothers actions to both police and cps immediately by law. That is how bad it was, and the \"this is our secret\" comment is dangerous red flag. It is used as a tool of grooming, and I have taught all of my students that no adult should ever demand them to keep secrets from their parents. Never.\n\nCombined with the full custody with no visitation, and your dads almost hysterical reaction, are insanely worrying. As a professional I would advise you to talk with safe adult (not mom!!!!), school would be helpful. Do not feel guilty about this. And knowing how your dad already has full custody, you don't have to worry about concrete consequenses. But I hope a professional can tell you the truth in person, that you did nothing wrong and this situation is not your fault.\n\nAnd outside of my job, unofficial advice: I almost got chills when you described your mother, and not the good kind. This is just my gut, but I think you should seriously limit contact with your mother, and talk with your dad. Ask your dad what he is scared of, and try to create more accurate picture of your mother without idealization or desperate yearn for connection. I hope your dad stops the nonsense with doors, he probably is desperately trying to control you to the point where it becomes toxic instead of protective.\n\nPs. Beware of the potential creeps if they contact you. Some people can be gross weirdos",
         "This is very well put.",
         "Yeah that's weird as hell",
         "Thank you.. I could talk to my dad about it again to learn more about his reasoning, but I think it was like making sure I don't call mom or get calls from her and also making sure I don't do anything bad or something like that..? He did say it was temporary though and said he will stop checking my phone and all eventually.\n\nEdit: I'm sorry for the edit, but I think it was also because I tried to hide those from him.",
         "Thank you! I am also the mom of a teen daughter (and I bought thongs for her at Aerie this weekend). I started talking to my kid when she was about the same age that masturbation is normal and healthy; it's not just for boys.  I also told her that she shouldn't have sex she doesn't want or doesn't feel good, and that she never owes anyone sex, for any reason. We talked about choices I made at her age that I am happy with now, and those that I wasn't happy with. If she wanted a toy, I would have considered it. \n\nI didn't think this was out there.",
         "No, my dad has full custody, and he was just letting my mom see me time to time.",
         "Dads aren't \"funny\" about their daughter's' sexuality, they're misogynist.",
         "If she was getting her decent thongs so her daughter wouldn\u2019t have to have her underwear giving her a constant wedgie that  has to be fussed with, I could see that. I spent so much time trying to keep my underwear out of my butt crack. Thongs were an awesome discovery. It the underwear was overly sexy and inappropriate that might not be cool. A sex toy isn\u2019t something you should probably buy your 14 year old. Kids can buy things themselves. It seems like the mom is either trying too hard or trying to sexualize her before she is ready. Keeping it a secret is a little off.",
         "I feel similar. Depends on what the toy is a bit in my mind too, which is maybe a me issue. The sexy undies is way weirder, why would you encourage a 14 yo to have sex? Masturbating, while weird to discuss with a parent, is less weird than buying your child lingerie.",
         "Uhhhh that\u2019s totally not true. Is she supposed to announce when she starts masturbating on a regular basis ? When she decides to buy her own sex toy?\u00a0",
         "The mom here doesn't have any custody rights. He has the right to make this call.",
         "Apparently she doesn't have the right, though. She doesn't have custody, and that's likely for a good reason. Dad needs to take it down, not just one notch, but like, five notches. Something about the mom's behavior is really, really creepy. Like, this is what grooming actually looks like.",
         "I was definitely exploring myself at 14, but it\u2019s weird for your mom to be pushing this on you, especially as you mention you weren\u2019t totally comfortable but went with it because (at least this is my interpretation) you wanted to feel close to mom and have that bonding moment. And for her to tell you specifically not to tell your dad is ringing alarm bells for me. Dad is your custodial parent, you shouldn\u2019t be pressured into keeping secrets from him. \n\nDad\u2019s reaction is also not great \u2014 some parts of it, like him needing to talk to your mom about this before you have more unrestricted access, make sense to me as an adult. He\u2019s not wrong to be wary of someone who is trying to push you into sexual stuff, even masturbation, that you\u2019re not comfortable with. Some parts of his reaction are bad, like yelling at you, shaming you, and taking away door privileges. I know he\u2019s probably freaking out about his darling daughter growing up as well, but that doesn\u2019t make his reaction okay. I want to be very clear here - you did absolutely nothing wrong, and are being put in a shit position by your parents. I\u2019m very sorry for that. If I were in your position, I would sincerely apologize for keeping the secret and for scaring him, but not for anything else.",
         "Yeah, I can't say I blame Dad for wigging out then.\n\nI do think it's unfair that you're essentially being punished by losing privacy when you didn't do anything wrong at all and tbh were the one made to feel uncomfortable.",
         "Your mom is trying to include you in an adult world that isn\u2019t yet appropriate, especially since you didn\u2019t bring it up or ask for the toy. That\u2019s not remotely appropriate.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with adult toys and there\u2019s nothing wrong with sex or thongs or dressing in a way that\u2019s revealing, if that\u2019s what makes you happy. There is something very wrong with pushing those things on a young person before they are ready.\n\nYour mom is in the wrong, your dad is protecting you.",
         "This is throwing major red flags for me because it seems like your mom has a creepy obsession with pushing you into sexual activity. Having \"a talk\" about boys is one thing, but buying you revealing underwear and sex toys is way over the line. So is telling you to keep secrets.",
         "Unless you had been asking your mother questions, she is out of line. Your father isn't handling it well either.\u00a0",
         "14! Bless, kiddo. This was truly, truly not okay.",
         "Then your mom is completely out of line. We can\u2019t really say what her motives are, but she is absolutely wrong regardless.",
         "Yea as a father of an 11 year old, I'd go off too, (on the mom) if her mom did this.  I feel like this is something you talk about with girlfriends, maybe mom and counselor but to buy toys and thongs, that's way overboard.  Especially since she iniated the whole thing as well. \n\nAs far as punishment.. I don't think you did anything wrong so I don't get that part, but yea Good luck",
         "You might want to remind your dad that you didn\u2019t ask for these things, they made you feel uncomfortable, and you put them away. It\u2019s not you he should be upset with. He\u2019s going overboard with the no closed door policy.",
         "Waaay inappropriate! I\u2019m with dad",
         "Wow. Ok. You\u2019re dad is right. Your mom was out of line. You and your dad need to sit down and have an honest discussion about sex. He needs to be part of the conversation if he\u2019s able to do it. My dad would never have been able to get the words out.",
         "Your dad is right and your mom is being very weird.",
         "Your mother is EXTREMELY out of line. I'm so sorry, this is sexual abuse and your dad is absolutely right to be putting a stop to it.\u00a0",
         "Sorry, but 14 is a bit young for \"dont-tell-your-dad\" conversations. At best, this is her way of isolating that part of your life to only her, which puts her moreso in a position of power than she had before with you. At worst, this is grooming behavior.\n\nYou have so much time to explore and learn about yourself! There's no rush. Don't feel obligated to adhere to the rules your Mom AND Dad are putting on your in regards to your own self-pleasure. It will never be any of their business unless you decide you need to consult them.",
         "Its not great for you to be using sex toys at this age. Explore first with your fingers what you like/don't like. Sex toys may make you numb to normal touch and you may end up accidentally hurting yourself down there as a result down the line. \n\nSide eyeing mom who got you sex toys without getting you in on birth control first.",
         "The undies are over the line. The toy could have been better included after having the talk. Your mom is crossing the line with you.",
         "So. Here\u2019s my question. I know a LOT of parents who would stock up on tissues and hand lotion and start enforcing a certain amount of laundry to be the boy\u2019s responsibility. To me this is a tacit understanding of what puberty is and does to tweens. I don\u2019t know if this is the girl equivalent or not but let\u2019s not pretend that 14 years olds aren\u2019t exploring their bodies.",
         "Something odd is going on with this thread. Parts of my post are missing and you're commiserating with me as though I'm the OP. If it was a misplaced comment, I'm letting you know OP might not get the message.\u00a0",
         "Oh eff off it didn't require that of OP, just that her age matters quite a bit in whether or not mom's gifts are appropriate or predatory. It's the entire reason why I followed it with age windows as you're suggesting.\u00a0",
         "Oh it's an all around mess OP is growing up in for sure if it's not made up.\n\n\nBut I grew up in a shit situation too and my mom would use any excuse to snoop through my stuff and take issue with even my own private journaling so who knows......some parents are super protective and controlling; some parents buy you dildos and lingerie \ud83e\udd37.",
         "She said she\u2019s not interested in any of it and her mom forced it on her. \u201cSexual from birth\u201d is a weird and wild thing to say. There\u2019s nothing sexual going through a toddlers mind when they touch a part of their body. \n\nIdk how you read this and got \u201ca girl is becoming a woman and her prude of a dad can\u2019t handle it so her creepy estranged mom forcing dildos on her is the hero\u201d. This is a deadbeat mother who left her kid returning to give her a (at best) vibrator and some thongs. Shes asking her to dish about boys and her thoughts on sex like a drunk 30 something at a bachelorette party. \n\nLeading with \u201cBetter than being with a guy (aka dating a peer)\u201d is peak brain worms.",
         "Yes. If there is something really terrible about mom, this is the right time for OP to find out.",
         "This is a bit too far for assumptions. It's more likely mom and dad were both real young when they had kids and they're equally bad, dad is just less bad as far as the court could tell.\n\nThat doesn't make this sort of assumption it true even if mom's behavior is out of whack. We also know dad's reaction was to take OP's door clean off the hinges so both parents sound a bit ...unhinged.",
         "Taking away her door and checking her phone isn't too good.  But he is right about restricting communications between OP and her mother.",
         "Nah, your mom was wrong for giving you the highly inappropriate gifts at your age. It's weird AF that's she's giving you revealing underwear ,thongs, and the sex toy.",
         "Given the nature of this post, please do not entertain any \"woman\" who might DM you asking you for more info about your post (if you tried the items your mother bought, or their suggestions that she did this to mean well (even if she did.)) This is all just a premise to coerce you to talk about sex with them. Do not answer any private questions, just block and move on. No one who is going to give you genuine guidance is going to do it privately.",
         "This might be difficult to hear, but what your mom did was really inappropriate and not in your best interest. You said that your mom doesn\u2019t have custody, so your dad is well within his rights to prevent you from seeing her, especially if he worries about your safety or wellbeing when you are with her. It sounds like that might be what\u2019s happening. If you feel like your dad doesn\u2019t have your best interests at heart, you need to talk to a teacher or coach or school counselor that you trust so they can help you sort through what\u2019s going on. You shouldn\u2019t have to deal with this alone! \n\nKeeping your mom\u2019s actions a secret was both a very normal reaction but also one that can lead to you getting hurt. Some adults will try to use your feelings of embarrassment or shame or your fear of getting in trouble to convince you to keep secrets from other adults in your life - that\u2019s what your mom did. It\u2019s a very effective form of manipulation as you\u2019ve experienced! You did nothing wrong, you were manipulated by an adult you trust and that\u2019s a scary thing to realize. \n\nI really can\u2019t emphasize enough how much of a red flag it is for an adult to tell a teenager to keep an uncomfortable secret. It\u2019s usually a sign that the adult knows they\u2019re doing something very wrong. So no matter how embarrassed or ashamed you feel, you really, really need to talk to a different adult that you trust about what happened! If you feel like you can\u2019t talk about it, write a note or send a text. If you really feel like you\u2019re out of options, posting on this subreddit is a good idea - plenty of women here will gladly help you sort through what\u2019s normal and safe vs abnormal and unsafe. \n\nNow for the discussion your mom should have had with you: it\u2019s normal for young teenagers to have questions about puberty, sex, and sexuality. It\u2019s also normal to not really be interested in those things yet. It\u2019s the sort of thing best taken at your own pace, and that\u2019s why what your mom did was so wrong. Adults that pressure or coerce teenagers into learning about sex, talking about it, or acting on their curiosities are not safe people to be around. I\u2019m not saying your mom is a bad person, just that for right now, it doesn\u2019t seem like she\u2019s acting in a safe way. \n\nPlease be very careful with who you talk to online about this stuff. Some people are real creeps. Open discussions on this subreddit should be safe - the mods will handle anyone being weird. Block and report anyone who DMs you trying to engage in discussions that make you uncomfortable. \n\nRemember how I said you should learn about this stuff at your own pace? [Planned Parenthood](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/teens) has some really great online learning resources that can answer many questions you might have, and you can choose what to read - no pressure, no judgement.\n\nFinally, if/when you do have discussions with any adults in your life about sensitive topics, pay close attention to your own feelings! If you feel like an adult is being pushy or asking you inappropriate questions or saying things that make you feel weird or touching you a little too much or in odd ways or making you feel guilty or conflicted (in regards to sex/puberty/sexuality) or maybe even just acting a little *too* interested in having these types of talks with you\u2026 get away from that person ASAP and tell several adults you trust!!!",
         "Hey girly, if an adult (ANY ADULT) asks you to keep a secret, *they are not a safe person to be around.* Next time tell a trusted adult and let them deal with it. This was inappropriate, your mom knew it, and knew she shouldn\u2019t be doing it.\n\nTo be clear: you did nothing wrong.",
         "How old was mom when she had you? Are you abnormally close in age? This is \"cool mom\" behavior and it's not great.\n\nHowever, that doesn't make dad's response appropriate or good. Often, when people have children too young you get these sorts of out of whack reactions. I'm really sorry you have to go through this.",
         "Yeah it\u2019s super creepy",
         "Agreed. She or mods should delete her answers\u00a0",
         "Yeah, it takes awhile to find a good therapist that fits, you shouldn't immediately be vulnerable with a new therapist and you shouldn't feel like they're telling you what to do. Therapists should feel like mirrors for yourself so that you can see and be validated for your own feelings and understand your own patterns. Any kind of projection on the therapist's part is a red flag, it should barely be about the therapist at all beyond their expertise and specialty, and that's all anyone needs to know about starting therapy.",
         "There is a big difference between your example and what OP has shared. We don\u2019t know what prompted the search. A search for cause has reasoning. A search of OPs intimate belongings without any prompt is the problem here.\n\nWhat OPs dad *should have done* is when he found these items, had a serious, but calm conversation about it and not punished her. He should have created a safe space for his kid to talk about these adult things. OP felt uncomfortable and/or unsafe telling their dad about these items. His reaction of being upset *at OP* is what was uncalled for. He missed a big opportunity of creating a level of trust with his kid.\n\nSo yes the search is a huge violation of privacy. Similar thing happened to me except it was a journal. I felt violated and when you feel like that **because of a parent**, it doesnt go away. You feel like you cant trust them. Kids dont handle boundary violations like adults do. They are powerless and that can do a lot of damage.",
         "This is a 14 year old kid. It\u2019s not a red flag to want to keep her safe from what may very well be sexually predatory behavior. Yes, like I said, dad is angry and frustrated. He\u2019s acting out. He will need to apologize and have a long, frank conversation with OP about what safety steps will be followed moving forward. But OP\u2019s dad isn\u2019t reading these comments and I can\u2019t give him that advice, or I would. All I can do is help this kid navigate this situation. And severing a relationship with an overall seemingly safe adult at this time because internet strangers called his one-time outburst behavior a red flag, is not a safe move for this child at this time.",

And your dad's response seems very focused on you rather than who actually is at fault - your mum. I am hoping your dad will calm down shortly and realised you have done nothing bad and actually taking your door away is also highly inappropriate and so is making you feel bad or wrong around this sort of subject matter.\n\nI am hoping that talking to him might help, if it doesn't you might have to start thinking about talking to someone at school because if your dad doesn't calm down then you have two parents failing you.\n\nYou are clearly a smart kid and I really wish you all the best navigating this.\n\nDo try to remember that being made to feel bad about anything around this subject is not how you should feel. As long as its you in the driving seat it's all good.",
         "I think the mindset in the past is if they're not introduced to sex, they won't think about it and the ignorance will keep them safer (or purer, or childish) for longer but I would argue it didn't work then and it certainly won't now. All it does is make them vulnerable to predators. If ignorance worked there wouldn't be teen pregnancies.\n\nThey need to know information *before* they need it and people are mistaking the idea that they will immediately act upon it. Our kids will know its okay to check back with us, or another trusted adult if they have questions and won't be shamed for them.",

They just go purely based on gut instinct and hope for the best.\n\nThis is also why parents should have literally NO control over what their kids are taught at school, FWIW.\n\nTwo parents working together to raise a child are better, in most cases, than just one.  I see NO evidence why that is any less true here.",

OP is 14, well into puberty age for a girl, and she's starting to experience aspects of growing up whether dad likes it or not. If OP's dad really wants to protect OP, he should start respecting and trusting his daughter to make her own choices and stop being so afraid of female sexuality. Going to the extent of refusing to allow OP to close her door is extreme and wrong, and it doesn't help OP at all. In fact it harms her.\n\n\nSounds like mom is far too interested in the sex life of her daughter who is too young to have a sex life and dad thinks female sexuality is dangerous in and of itself or, worse, wrong.",

OP didn\u2019t go to this topic or ask for the adult toy. \n\nI get it, it\u2019s gonna happen sometime soon if not already but it\u2019s not something that her mother sounds like she has an appropriate place in, in this instance. \n\nAlso there\u2019s explicit/implicit. Parents are sending a message that they know what\u2019s going on in the boys bedroom and that\u2019s okay but boy has to clean that up. Parents might tell a boy this age that he needs to start doing his own bedding or socks, or whatever lmao. However it\u2019d be very strange to buy the boy a playboy. While sex toys are awesome for consenting adults, they are considered sexually explicit, like pornography. While I understand they may not be visually realistic, and there are many home made options, they are not appropriate for children, especially so young. \n\nI would likely feel differently if OP were 17, and her and her mother were more close before this generally, but as it stands, I find it irresponsible and poorly thought out at best.",

However as her full time parent, he has a responsibility to provide information and privacy so she\u2019s not exploited or unaware of a really important part of human life. I find people who don\u2019t educate their children or allow others to educate them to be extremely negligent.\u00a0\n\n\nand every man who has ever complained about sex in his relationship, and then goes on to insist on ignorance for his daughter, is setting both her and her future romantic partners ip for failure. it\u2019s incredibly emotional and irrational behavior.\u00a0\n\n\nThat said, i agree there is a difference between someone else asking you to keep a secret and choosing to keep a secret because your dad is the type to make you keep your door open so you don\u2019t learn anything about yourself sexually. Between 14-18, I\u2019d expect teenagers to have more and more minor secrets, with major areas of concern being more open. The whole thing is complicated by the father acting irrationally - maybe the mother is concerned that OPs father hasn\u2019t provided any education? Concerned the daughter still acts like she\u2019s 8? Maybe it\u2019s totally grooming? Very hard to tell with two parents acting inappropriately.\u00a0\n\n\nI agree it was a serious overreach since it included lingerie.

Secretive conversations about sex to a child that\u2019s too young for these conversations, gifts, asking the child to hide it all from a parent. That\u2019s fucking grooming, and even if mom actually has no ill intentions, she\u2019s teaching her daughter that this kind of behavior is fine and normal, which sets her up to be taken advantage of by someone else down the line. It needs to stop. \n\nBelieve me, I know the family court is flawed, and I know that just because one parent is more fit than the other, it doesn\u2019t make them parent of the year. It just means they at least meet the minimum requirements for getting custody. If I had to guess, the courts granted dad some custody because of drug use, lack of a stable place for OP to stay, or because of extreme mental health issues. We can\u2019t know that for sure, but mom reads like she\u2019s having manic episodes or otherwise making really bad choices in her life.

With little evidence to show for it of course. Marginalized groups starting to equalize can cause a lot of consternation among the traditional hierarchy.",
         "I've wondered about this too, for years. How many men who consider themselves feminists have unconscious negative reactions when they hear a woman speaking strongly, criticising the way things are, and asking for support in doing something difficult. How many such men even do dishes/laundry/child care/cleaning without feeling they are unduly pressured to do it. We should be way past this, and many are, but I'm afraid for how many of us still aren't. \n\nVote blue if you haven't already. The media wants this to be a horse race so they'll call it a dead heat even if they have data suggesting otherwise. I guess I'm OK with that because I wouldn't want 1 person who would vote blue sitting out because they thought they didn't need to. I remember hearing an NPR piece the day of the 2016 election, talking about Hillary's road to the white house. I thought at the time it was premature, and it sure was. I hope we have a better result this time.",

The internet criticism market is on steroids right now so all the stupid political and sexist nitpicking really should be ignored as much as possible - don't give it views unless you have something clever to say. Aside from all that ridiculous bs, Kamala does have an issue. She has tried on so many different personalities, starting way back in the presidential primaries vs Biden and co that nobody really knew who the real Kamala was. All these toads she has run against have clear personalities that people recognize, Kamala has always changed to fit her strategy of the day, which has backfired at times.",

         "I guess it is worth noting that I was looking at a comparison of Harris\u2019 polling results in swing states vs Bidens actual election results. In those polls she was down 1-2 pts in some states and only up 1-2 pts in others while Bidens results were consistently a few points higher in most states.

Honestly I've been wishing Walz was top of the ticket not cause I think he is a better candidate than Harris, but simply cause I think his chances of winning would be better by simply being white and male. Add to that he is quite personable so I think it would have been close to a slam dunk...I really hope Americans come through cause another Teump win and the Far Right winds that have been stirring up for the last decade plus in Europe will blow even harder.",

         "Oh, you mean compared to Biden's 2020 election results.\n\n\nWell, I don't know that that's a reasonable comparison. It was a different race, with different things happening in the country. There was a lot of anger about COVID (there still should be but people have decided not to care) and that was a major factor in the race. I wouldn't put too much store in a comparison with that.\u00a0\n\n\nI'm really hoping the polls are biased and we'll see a Harris victory tomorrow. I'm very very nervous but it's good that we'll finally know soon.",
         "In most if not all countries where there has been an election since Covid + inflation aftermath, the incumbent government has been kicked out or massively damaged. This seems to be the main complaint against the Democrats by fellow Democrats or centerists. \n\nA more fair comparison is to look at hers vs Biden most recently aka this summer and you can see the huge jump in the positive. \n\nAnother important dimension worth noting is not only is she a woman but she is a woman of colour AND from the most liberal state. These are all factors that will affect closet-bigots on both sides, and yet she is still holding her own."

      "title": "Voters Are Poised to Reshape Abortion Access: Ten states are set to vote on ballot measures that could restore points of access in the South and elsewhere",
      "text": "https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/abortion-ballot-measures-election-2024-ed49d798\n\nArticle has charts and graphs if you can get by the paywall. \n\n> By Laura Kusisto and Jennifer Calfas\n>\n> Abortion-rights groups are on track to secure constitutional protections for the procedure in as many as 10 states on Tuesday, which would mark the most significant expansion of abortion access since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.\n\n> Polling data and fundraising totals have signaled strong support for most of the ballot initiatives, which appear in states with a range of political leanings. The measure that could have the biggest practical impact comes from Florida, which had been an island of abortion access in the South until a six-week ban went into effect in May of this year. But it is also the toughest test because supporters need to reach a 60% threshold for passage. \n\n> Voters in the battleground states of Arizona and Nevada also could decide to enshrine abortion rights there. Democrats are hoping the measures will help drive turnout and deliver a presidential victory for Kamala Harris. Arizona currently limits the procedure to 15 weeks of pregnancy, about two months earlier than what was allowed under Roe. Nevada already allows abortion up to 24 weeks, but supporters say a constitutional amendment would cement those rights.\n\n> Some 17 states now ban abortion after the earliest weeks of pregnancy. Most of the ballot measures would restore access through fetal viability, or about halfway through a typical pregnancy\u2014although opponents argue that the initiatives are so broadly worded that they would allow abortion throughout pregnancy. \n\n> \u201cWhat\u2019s very clear across all campaigns is that people don\u2019t want the government involved in private medical decisions. That\u2019s been this uniting force,\u201d said Chris Melody Fields Figueredo, executive director of the Ballot Initiative Strategy Center, a nonprofit that promotes progressive ballot measures.  \n\n> Abortion-rights supporters already have used ballot initiatives to override conservative legislatures, winning seven consecutive measures since Roe was overturned. In some of the states being contested now, groups favoring abortion access are fundraising at a clip that far outpaces their opponents, including in Florida where they have pulled in more than $100 million.\n\n> Polling on ballot measures has been more limited than in the presidential contest and other high-profile races. Antiabortion groups say they have seen some late fundraising momentum and remain optimistic they could pull out a win in some of these states, especially Florida.  \n\n> \u201cGoing into Election Day, we\u2019re seeing ballot-measure races tighten in a way we haven\u2019t in previous abortion-amendment fights,\u201d said Kelsey Pritchard, director of state public affairs for Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America. She said abortion-rights supporters were using exaggerated scare tactics to suggest that women can never get abortions, even in grave emergencies. \n\n> Florida is a crucial battleground because before the overturning of Roe, it had the third-highest number of abortions in the U.S. After Roe\u2019s downfall, Florida became one of the few access points in the South, and women often drove there overnight from places such as Louisiana and Texas. \n\n> That has changed since the six-week ban. The state has seen about 2,500 fewer in-person abortions each month, according to WeCount, an abortion-data project sponsored by the Society of Family Planning, which supports abortion rights. That has had ripple effects across the country, straining clinics in North Carolina and leading to a surge in demand for pills ordered online. \n\n> Abortion providers said women still sometimes travel to Florida from out of state only to find out they are too far along in pregnancy for the procedure. \u201cIt\u2019s horrible news to have to deliver over and over and over again,\u201d said Chelsea Daniels, a doctor at a Miami abortion clinic. \n\n> The antiabortion side has struggled to mount strong campaigns in states across the country, faced with donors pessimistic about the prospects for success. But in Florida it has an ally in Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has taken an unusually aggressive posture toward defeating the measure, calling it \u201cradical\u201d and \u201cvery, very extreme.\u201d A state public-health agency has run information on its website defending the ability of women facing medical emergencies to obtain abortions under current law, and the Florida health department recently threatened criminal charges against television stations for running an ad in support of the measure, saying it was misleading. \n\n> \u201cIf we win in Florida, it will be because of his leadership, and it serves as a model going forward,\u201d Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America President Marjorie Dannenfelser said of DeSantis. \n\n> Abortion opponents also believe they can win in South Dakota, where they have a fundraising edge. Nebraska, meanwhile, presents the most complicated picture, because the state ballot includes two competing measures, one to protect abortion rights and the other to outlaw the procedure in most cases after the first trimester. That has the potential to muddy the waters.\n\n> Abortion-rights groups are optimistic that they can pull out a win in Missouri, the first state to enforce its near-total ban after the Supreme Court overturned Roe. They have a fundraising advantage, having pulled in about $30 million compared with about $5 million for their opponents. \n\n> Rachel Sweet, the campaign manager for Missourians for Constitutional Freedom, also has led successful abortion-rights ballot-measure campaigns in Kansas, Kentucky and Ohio, using messaging focused on freedom, medical privacy and individual choice. \n\n> \u201cIn a state such as Missouri, you can\u2019t win with just Democrats, right? There aren\u2019t enough Democrats to do that,\u201d Sweet said.\n\n> The Missouri campaign has featured distinctly religious messaging. Sweet\u2019s group has run an ad featuring a pastor who says, \u201cWhen a woman says an abortion is right for her, I believe that should be her decision, not the government\u2019s.\u201d\n\n> Cassidy Anderson, who is helping lead the campaign against the initiative, said that presenting abortion as a decision between a person and God is a miscalculation in Missouri. \u201cThat\u2019s a poor choice. You\u2019re going to be hard-pressed to find many Bible-believing churches that are going to believe that,\u201d she said.",

On top of our legal system being dismantled and every single resource being hijacked by project 2025, there will literally be no saving DEI in the job market, and everyone will be much more openly racist and misogynistic in the hiring process and at the job, not even counting how bad it's already gotten with the misogyny slop all the men are consuming online.

      "text": "I was on my way home from work by metro when this happened. I accidentally made eye contact with a guy who was walking towards me, he said hi and I said hi back because I thought it was because of the eye contact. He sat in front of me and started talking, and that\u2019s when I noticed he was a big guy wearing a shiesty and didn\u2019t look friendly. I\u2019m Chinese so I pretended like I don\u2019t speak English and just ignored him, but he wouldn\u2019t stop talking. He was saying he wanted to marry me, wanted my number etc. I was scared, I froze and didn\u2019t know what to do. \n\nThat\u2019s when a lady with a daughter that\u2019s about 4-6 years old stood up for me and told him that I didn\u2019t want to talk to him. He told her something like that\u2019s not her business and kept talking to me. I still ignored him. And then he started talking to the lady that he was gonna \u201cbeat the shit out of her\u201d and that he was in prison for 20 years and didn\u2019t mind going back. He continued to talk to me, and I just ignored and tried to text my friend. I then heard him making up bs about the lady, saying that her husband dumped her and that she could never find a man because she\u2019s a bitch. I can\u2019t remember exactly what he said. But it\u2019s a bunch of really terrible stuff. All in front of her daughter who\u2019s just a little kid. \n\nIn the end I stood up and went to another cabin and she went there soon after. I apologized to her and told her she didn\u2019t deserve that, and she just smiled and said that it\u2019s ok and that\u2019s just crazy people. She was so brave. I would never be able to stand up for a random woman if I was at her position. I keep thinking about what could I have done differently to avoid that from happening. Maybe I just shouldn\u2019t have said hi. Maybe I should\u2019ve left earlier, but I just didn\u2019t want to escalate things or pissing him off. Maybe I should\u2019ve called the police or security but I was so scared that he found out I do speak English. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t have pretended like I don\u2019t speak English and should\u2019ve just told him that I didn\u2019t want to interact with him. I was so, so scared that I didn\u2019t do anything right. \n\nIf this lady can see this post, I just want to let you know how sorry I am that I involved you and your kid in this because I wasn\u2019t brave enough to stand up for myself and that thank you so much for what you did. You didn\u2019t deserve anything that guy said to you. ",

         "I was on a packed tram once with my son and a guy in a group of friends (who were all varying levels of drunk) started talking to a woman on her own, asking which one of his friends was the most drunk. She didn't speak the local language and he started talking to her in English. She was obviously not interested and uncomfortable. \n\nI told the dude off and told him to leave her alone. He claimed it was just for fun and I countered with who is it fun for? He then spent the next few mins asking his friends if what he said was wrong in a way that made sure I heard him. He clearly didn't think so, but I hope that he thought a little more about it for next time. \n\nMy kid was nervous about it and a little worried. But we made time after to discuss why it's important for that sort of stuff to be checked and that what really should have happened is his male friends should have told him to cut it out. Because they are the ones he's most likely to listen to. And that when my son grows up, I hope he is brave enough to go against the grain when/if his friends ever start talking shit or being dicks. \nI also told my son that a few years ago I wouldn't have been brave enough, but now I am beyond letting shit slide in certain contexts. I felt confident that with so many people around he was unlikely to get physically violent with me and the fact I was with a kid was a bit protective too. Not 100% safe of course but a calculated risk. \n\nThat dude who harassed you and her is the problem, you did nothing wrong and neither did she.",

Luckily I've become older and wiser and realized it's not my job to cater to their fragile egos. I need to look out for myself. Nowadays whenever I find myself in a similar situation I will immediately get up and walk to another cabin with confidence. I have also drawn attention to scary situations by loudly saying, \"This man is harassing me. Please leave me alone.\" Usually they become self conscious when other passengers are staring at us and they stop. Don't be so hard on yourself, but take this as a learning opportunity. With more practice speaking up you will find your voice. Remember you don't have to be nice.

Maybe that guy shouldn't think eye contact is permission to harass. Maybe he should take a fucking clue.

And remember, it could be as simple as pretending to be a \u201cfriend\u201d to a lone woman being harassed, and you don\u2019t have to do anything other than show solidarity.

Maybe I should\u2019ve called the police or security but I was so scared that he found out I do speak English. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t have pretended like I don\u2019t speak English and should\u2019ve just told him that I didn\u2019t want to interact with him.~~\n\nWe've all had those maybes. I put them in this format because I really want to make it clear to you that these thoughts? You can let them go. You don't need them. They're not helpful in any capacity.\n\n\nHere is the truth and please don't forget that you **get to** believe it:\n\nThis lady knew why she stood up for you. She did this because once upon a time *she* was the woman just sitting, silent and scared and not sure how to tell the guy to leave her alone.\n\nShe spoke up because now, after all these years and after having her daughter and after whatever experiences lead her here... she could. And she's glad that she did because you were safe.\n\nDon't forget that in a good world we do not need to be \"brave\". In a world where all are decent, noone would have to stand up to anyone.\n\nSo when we have to do that, it is because someone else decided to be terrible - namely this guy. Every last terrible thing that happened in this situation is entirely and exclusively *his* fault. He harrassed you and that's the end of it. You do not need a justification for being overwhelmed by unprovoked (!!!!! saying \"hi\" and making eye contact do NOT count) attention. You were just minding your own business - you did not cause this.\n\n\nAnd since it's pertinent, please know that many studies have shown that traumatic incidents always come with these \"Maybe\"-thoughts. One of the reasons is that situations like yours make us feel helpless - and by obsessing over what we could have done differently, we (clumsily) try to upkeep the idea that we can prevent this from happening again.\n\n\nThe thing is that these thoughts just hurt us, put us on trial and demand for us to be superhuman *literally* in the exact same moment another human being decided to be the worst possible version of themselves. That is a completely unfair standard and you do not have to apply it to yourself.\n\n\nYou *get* to be overwhelmed, scared and incapable of dealing with this. It shouldn't happen in the first place.\n\nBut as a survivor of multiple assaults and the PTSD one gets from that, who has been in both your and this woman's shoes, I am so very, very happy to say that you might very well one day be her.\n\nWe all can be - if we put the blame where it should be:\n\nWith the men who won't leave us alone.\n\n\nPS: And even if you're never that woman, that is okay. The whole point of taking care of each other is so the ones who hurt more get more protection. That's what community is, that's what kindness is. Sometimes we need help, sometimes we give it. That's a beautiful thing, not a flaw.\n\n\nI'm sending you all the warmth I can muster. You did nothing wrong!",

She showed her daughter bravery and strength because in a few years, that daughter will need it too.\n\nYou do whatever you need to do to be safe. That's what matters.\n\nStanding up for yourself is sometimes harder than standing up for someone else. That woman didn't deserve this, but you sure didn't either. It was out of your control.

She might appreciate a 'thank you', though!",

         "Wow, this kind of reminds me of a situation I was in a few years ago. I was studying abroad in France, and one night, around midnight, I was walking back home after hanging out with some friends at a bar (and we'd only had mocktails so I wasn't drunk or anything). After we got on the subway we'd all gone our separate ways so I was walking back down this residential street alone, about maybe 5 minutes away from my apartment when suddenly I heard footsteps running up behind me and I turned around. It was some guy and he stopped and apologized for startling me. Then he started walking with me and I didn't really know how to feel about this since he wasn't being overtly creepy but I also didn't really want him around, so I just pretended I didn't speak French. Well he just as easily switched to English so I just sighed and decided the next best thing was to be short with him and give him one word answers to all his questions. Again they weren't super invasive or overtly creepy, things like \"how old are you? Why are you in France? Oh you're studying, what do you study?\" so I figured maybe being cold and kind of \"bitchy\" would make him go away, but it didn't so eventually I just started outright ignoring everything he said. Except he still kept walking with me and asking why I wasn't answering him. We were getting kind of close to where I lived at that point and I didn't want him to see it so once we got to the end of the road I stopped and turned to him and asked directly \"are you following me?\" and surprisingly he actually said yes. So I just said \"stop, leave me alone\". To which he actually said okay, and then turned around and left. I kept turning around and looking for the next few minutes but it turns out he was really gone. Once I got back into my apartment and started thinking about it, I started to feel bad. I started thinking \"maybe he just saw that I was alone and wanted to help me, maybe he was just socially awkward, maybe it was a language issue, maybe I was unnecessarily rude to someone who was just trying to help me. After all, if he was really a bad person intending to hurt me, would he have left me alone when I told him to?\"    \nIn the end nothing bad happened and I guess I'll never know what his intentions were but your story just reminded me of that. I kept telling myself that I was making it out to be worse than it was and that I shouldn't have felt uncomfortable or creeped out by it.",

What works in one situation may fail due to completely random variables outside our awareness or control. \n\nAnd some men will absolutely go ahead no matter WHAT we do, and harm us anyway. \n\nI am sorry to say it like that, because it\u2019s completely depressing and terrifying. \n\nBut I don\u2019t know a single woman who hasn\u2019t had this experience. \n\nAnd none of us were victimized/harmed because we had the wrong instinct or didn\u2019t handle it well. \n\nIt\u2019s that there are actually a lot of men who see women as something they\u2019re entitled to, and there are a lot of men with uncontrolled rage, contempt for women, men who do not see us as people. \n\nSo all we can do is our best. Follow our instincts in the moment. \n\nIt\u2019s fucking sad bc OP thinks she went wrong by smiling - well the fact is that YES TOO MANY ENTITLED CREEPS have ROBBED us of the ability to be polite and friendly and kind, without immediately punishing us as though that was a promise, and then raging at us when we don\u2019t deliver. \n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean she should feel like she did something wrong by smiling. It\u2019s our cultural instinct is to smile, greet, be friendly, in a lot of places. And it *shouldn\u2019t* be a problem. \n\nAnd when it is, it\u2019s because we had an unfortunate encounter with a man who hunts women (to one degree or another). \n\nIt\u2019s just really hard - women have to scrutinize everything they fucking do and it\u2019s exhausting and unsustainable. \n\nWe can\u2019t be perfect and there\u2019s no way of knowing what will set some dude off.

         "Someone posted a quote in here in the last week from some feminist I can't recall the name of saying, 'Men don't feel that they *are* powerful, they feel entitled to power.'\n\nThat pretty much captures it for me.  Men are taught that their opinions are more important and valid than other people's opinions, and it's just How Things Are, so they rarely notice that a bunch of people are not treated the same way.  They mostly believe that their opinions are in fact more valid and important, because that's how other people treat them.  Many cishet men also believe that women should be listening to them instead of to themselves.\n\nThe cultural expectation that men are competent and wise leaders prompts most to behave as though they are, which frequently becomes enough of a pattern that they often assume they simply are those things without needing to put in any particular effort.  This is where Dunning-Kruger effect comes in.  If you are usually treated as though your opinion is important and taken seriously, no matter what you're actually saying, there's little incentive to second-guess or improve any of the thinking that led to you to that opinion.  I don't want to paint with too broad a brush here, there are of course many reasons to your typical male-identified person will want to improve their performance in many areas of life.  But for a lot of men, the boundaries around that growth-oriented attitude and humility are quite dense, and do not bleed over into other areas of life.  So men are likely to be  motivated to critique themselves and acknowledge their limitations at their job, but not at home.  Whereas we all know well how being raised female means you are expected to criticize yourself first in almost all contexts before looking for outside explanations.\n\nAnother way to put this is, the nature of male supremacist cultures pushes women to endlessly question themselves, which is a form of critical thinking and reasoning.  This applies to most areas of life.  So we're used to applying the tools of critical analysis constantly.  We become practiced at it, and it's natural to assume that everyone else is doing the same.  Add on top of that the confidence that most men have, and the general perception is that we're all thinking about all areas of life with similar levels of self-reflection and intention to improve.\n\nBut if most men are turning off that part of their brain when they interact with women in their lives, if they leave their critical reasoning and self-reflections at their job or with their friends/family, suddenly there's this canyon between our thinking and the thinking of most men.  They aren't used to applying those skills in every context, and that flattens their perception of any domain they haven't chosen to apply critical thinking to.  Natural to assume things we don't have much familiarity with are less complex than they are, we all do that.  How much could there possibly be to know about linear algebra, or soil types?  \n\nMost of the time, Dunning-Kruger effect doesn't do us any harm.  It's fine that we just trust the detergent company to know what they're talking about when they say a combination of chemicals we don't understand will clean our clothes, or that our doctor knows more than we do.\n\nBut when it comes to men understanding how women think, and how important their voices are to our conversations, Dunning-Kruger bites a lot of people in the ass.  They're coming in with no understanding, relying on simplistic self-affirming beliefs that they must know better, that women want to hear from them on topics they know little about and have never had a reason to think through carefully.",

      "title": "The longer I live with my dad, the more I understand why my mum was so angry all the time",
      "text": "I still live in my parents' house, while I'm doing a PhD. They wanted me to stay with them to save money. Last March my mum died; she had developed sudden and fast-moving motor neurone disease just a few months before, and she went from living a full and busy life to completely bedbound in no time. It was horrific, and I'm still struggling to deal with it all. We were very close.\n\nBefore she died I was already very nervous about living with just my dad, because he is Difficult. He's 81, definitely showing signs of some kind of dementia for many years but he's deep in denial, and he was already hard to deal with before that. When he's happy he's fine (mostly), but he can be really difficult to live with. He assured me I was fine to stay with him as long as I needed, and honestly with my limited income and the fact I have a dog to look after (inherited from my mum) I don't really have an alternative at the moment.\n\nBut I wish so much that I did, because every day living with just him I understand more and more why for most of my life my mum was often so frustrated and angry. He is maddening and thoughtless and cannot even consider the idea he might be in the wrong, ever. It makes me want to scream constantly, and if I do then everyone acts like I'm crazy for overreacting and making a fuss, when actually I've been keeping it together for ages against impossible odds.\n\nWhich is what my mum was often like as well. I never fully understood it before. I knew she got frustrated with him, but I never realised how unappreciated, unheard, and powerless she must have felt all the time. It's like screaming at a brick wall. I am exhausted and depressed and furious all of the time. 90% of my therapy sessions are about him and trying to just get through every day not knowing what insanity awaits me when I get home.\n\nSometimes I come home and he's dumped a bunch of random stuff in my space for me to tidy up. Or he'll be trying to cook and he'll use ingredients I bought and make something disgusting, while I try to tell him I can't eat what he's making because it will make me feel sick, and then he leaves the kitchen in an absolute state that I have to clean up. Or he'll corner me and try to pressure me to meet and be chummy with the woman he started dating THREE MONTHS after my mother died, despite me telling him multiple times I'm not ready and I don't know if or when I will be.\n\nEven just having a regular conversation with him is exhausting, because he doesn't listen and he doesn't remember. I'll tell him something 10 times. I'll explain something clearly and he'll get confused. We go round and round in circles with me just trying to ask how his day was, or what he's doing that evening. He never asks what I've been up to or what my plans are.\n\nI'm exhausted, and I feel so terrible I never really understood what my mum was dealing with every day. She was a buffer between us for years, and she bore the brunt of it. And now I have to take it, and everyone thinks I'm just volatile and crazy like they thought she was.\n\nIt is so unfair that he can just push and push and push and drive me and my mum insane, and we just have to take it. He gets away with it because he's a man, and he's old, and 'that's just how he is', and \\*of course\\* we must be the crazy ones because we're the ones screaming about seemingly tiny things. No one sees the thousand other things that got me to the breaking point. Yesterday I had a breakdown at Sunday lunch and made a huge scene about potatoes. But it wasn't about the potatoes; it was about me working hard to make a veggie meal for myself, and a pudding my brother loves, and then my dad cooked all of the potatoes with the meat so I couldn't have any.\n\nBecause he just doesn't think, and he doesn't care. And being thoughtless is not an excuse; it's the whole damn problem.\n\nEdit:\n\nThank you so much to everyone who's commented with support and advice. I'm getting a few repeated suggestions/questions so I just want to address them here for simplicity if that's OK:\n\n1. I should make him get assessed for dementia again.\n\nI have absolutely no control on this situation. He is physically fit and to most people would appear absolutely fine. I cannot drag him unwillingly to an exam, or trick him into it. I have tried to get my siblings to form a united front, but they are dithering because they don't see how bad it is. I know that eventually something bad will probably happen, and I just have to hope it doesn't involve my dog or any of my niblings.\n\n2. I should rehome my dog and move out.\n\nMy dog in non-negotiable. He and my PhD are basically my two priorities at the moment. My mum and I got him as a puppy, he was always \\*our\\* dog. I have trained him, and cared for him, and loved him for seven years. He is, sad as it is to say, the thread on which hangs my mental health. There is no acceptable solution to my situation that does not involve Bramble staying with me.\n\nRegarding moving out, while I am lucky that because my PhD is in STEM I do get a monthly bursary, it already wasn't very high and this year I've had to reduce myself to part time in my PhD which means half the money each month. I had to go down to part time because I am exhausted and depressed, and I had already lost time being exhausted and depressed. It was basically a requirement of me passing my upgrade viva. Because of that, I am not making enough money to rent anywhere. My uni is in a HCOL area, for miles around. And while I am having a lot of difficulties living with my dad, he does take a few things off my plate by walking the dog and being around in the day when I'm in the lab to make sure he doesn't get too lonely. If I moved out, I would either lose more time every day walking Bramble or I'd have to hire a daily dogwalker - more money I don't have. I also have mobility issues (not enough to qualify for any assistance) so I can't live healthily in a cheap and terrible bedsit. Bramble also doesn't deserve to live somewhere horrible without an outdoor space. I considered applying to be an RA at my uni to get free/discounted housing, but Bramble wouldn't be able to come with me and I can't leave him with my dad without worrying he won't be looked after properly. No, they don't accept ESAs in halls, only official guide dogs - which Bramble, for all his charms, is certainly not.\n\n3. I'm going to fail my PhD\n\nHello my intrusive thoughts made real. I am working so hard. I have thousands of samples and a plan. I'm doing my best. I try to get to campus most days to go to the lab or do other work. I have a good uni support system, my supervisor knows a lot about my situation. And one thing about my dad is he does want me to get my PhD, so he won't deliberately sabotage it at least.\n\n4. My mental health\n\nAgain, I'm doing my best. I'm seeing a therapist, I'm working on mindfulness, I have a support system and I cry to my friends a lot. I'm still grieving my mum, and some days are just really hard. I also have long covid so I'm tired and have a low mood a lot. But I do consider my mental health a priority.\n\n5. Is his New Woman a gold-digger?\n\nHard to say. He met her volunteering through church. He repeatedly insists he's not going to marry her, which is honestly more worrying because he says it every time we argue about her. Most of my siblings (half sibs so different mum) were uncomfortable with how fast he moved on, but were too scared of his response to say that to him - so again, I have to be the bad guy with an opinion. To my knowledge she owns her own house, has enough disposable income to go on cruises and jetset around Europe, and has children and grandchildren, so at the very least she doesn't need my dad's money.\n\n  \nEdit 2:\n\nOK to be clear on this one, yes I'm almost certain my dad has dementia. But my main issue is with his behaviours and traits that he has had my entire life. This is not all dementia - I know everyone is focussing on that, but he is also just a mean and thoughtless man a lot of the time. Sometimes he's very kind and selfless, but he will always revert back to the worst version of himself. This isn't a new thing, and it's not just since my mum died. It's just been exacerbated since then.\n\nAlso everyone telling me to have him committed, call social services, talk to a lawyer to force him to go to the doctor: what exactly do you think happens after I take the nuclear option? Do you think he stays calm and cheerful and doesn't absolutely lose his mind? If he passes the exam again, or if social services think he's fine, or if he gets a better lawyer, do you think I am then left in a safe and stable situation? Could you think this through for a minute?\n\nEdit 3:\n\nPlease, I beg you, stop telling me to put a mini fridge in my room. None of the issues have anything to do with the fridge. When I said he cooked all the potatoes in meat I mean all the potatoes that he cooked were cooked in meat, not that they were no potatoes left in the house. I bought them for everyone to have. I do not mind buying ingredients for shared meals; I am living here rent free I can contribute food. What I cared about was being forgotten. Yes I have my own food and snacks, he respects the fridge boundaries somehow",

The woman he started dating after 3 months may be a nice person, or may be after his money; you have no way of knowing which. Then hire a caregiver to help you with him.\u00a0\n\n\nAlso to note that if he was like this with your mother all their life, then it's not dementia that's causing his behavior, just making it worse.",

I watch this often in our patients. \nTake care of yourself!",
         "Are you me????? My mum died, i'm stuck living with my Dad (and often other family members) because I'm on the waiting list for an accessible property. He will go shopping and buy a load fo shit, block up the fridge, have a go at me for not eating the food in there that either I can't eat, don't eat, or don't even know about because I hardly go into the kitchen. But I can't buy my food becuase he hasn't left me enough room to store it. There's three cupboards, he has one full of tinned and dried foods, another full of teh kitchenware he impulsively buys from Amazon. I have to argue with him to keep the third for me. He will regularly throw out things because he \"doesn't know what they were for\" and often times they're mine. Sometimes I'll ask him where something is, and he'll say he must have thrown it out only for me to find it months later somewhere else.\n\nHe will say yes to helping everyone else, but i'm \"Not his problem\".\n\nI can't watch a film with him, he constantly talks over it. He will ask questions on what's going on whilst the characters are explaining what's going on. He will literally go \"is that the one where (major plot spoiler)\". Well I don't know because I haven't seen it, but is there a point in watching now? He'll then go on and on and on and on at me that it doesn't matter that he's spoiled the film, I'm being silly and should just watch it anyway. If I try and watch movies in my room, he'll follow me and just shout at me that i'm being silly and stupid and to watch the film with him in the living room. If I've watched a film by myself and he finds out, he will get upset with me.\n\nHe has stopped speaking to me for nearly a month because I dared to throw out some of my own belongings that were broken. The whole place is like a hoarder's dumping ground but somehow everyone expects me to fix it, and to talk to him, and to get other family members who add to the problem to understand. I've tried. He doesn't listen. Nobody listens, and they defer to him.\n\nAnd then the ones who do understand who see my side of the story say \"Well can't you just explain to him that\" no he doesn't listen. \"oh but when I said\" yeah he told you what you wanted to hear, closed the door and laughed about what you said with a shake of his head and sat down, seething that anyone dared to tell him what to do. \"But if you just\" let's go back to point one: he doesn't listen. And he will repeat himself over and over and over again to shut down a conversaiton.\n\nOh and he spends so much money on frivelous impulsive shit that he can't afford anything so i'm consatntly footing the bill. And people say to me \"But what's he going to do when you move out\". i don't know, learn to be an adult???\n\nAnd i'm stuck here because despite everyone knowing what i'm living with, nobody sees it as a problem(TM) and i just have to wait for an accessible place to beocme available.\n\nBut, here's the thing that I realised long before my mum died, and it's going to sound harsh. She chose to stay. She didn't put herself or you first. She accepted being treated like this. And when I realised that with my mum, I started having very frank discussions with her, and she never had answers to the question \"Why have you put up with this\". She knew what the future would be like for me and she didn't do anything to prevent it. She stayed. For all the song and dance she did about leaving an abusive relationship in the past, she stayed with my Dad. So... there's only so far my sympathy goes, is what I'm saying.",

Because, she still struggles with the mental abuse from when she was a kid. He put down her and her brother and was a selfish and crappy dad and husband.\n\n\nNow, he sits in that apartment and I deal with him mostly (he\u2019s still family) and he talks about apologizing to his kids.

You can add social pressure by being concerned since you don't want others think of them poorly for whatever action it is (even if no one has said a word about it).  When they can't remember, they aren't sure what has transpired.  While it seems bad to use their short term memory problems as a tool to settle things down, given the personal cost otherwise, it's more like having a nightlight for a kid who is afraid of the dark.",

Please know, if he does have this disease, that one of the behaviors can be absolutely being unable to comprehend that they have the disease. And it will only get harder and harder. Please do what you can do get your dad to the doctor as soon as you can and get power of attorney and other legal capabilities in place. As hard as it is, it will be harder if your dad is deemed incapable of making decisions for himself BEFORE you have got a bunch of legal stuff in place. I know it sounds impossible but if there is any way you can put your frustration to the side and just look at this as a task that needs to be done, and your dad as a blocker to that task, you will be helped. Do yourself a favor and chalk up all the bad behavior to dementia, which is a disease, and therefore uncontrollable.

Dementia is a serious brain altering condition so don't think of it as something normal you can talk through. You can't. With dementia there is damage to the limbic system which is involved in processing emotions, and damage to it can change how a person feels and reacts. There's way more to dementia.

He's getting worse, but a lot of this is who he is as a person.\n\nAnd I did not choose to be in this situation. I moved back in with my parents after my master's degree while I looked for a job. The job market is so shit that even with a BSc and MSc from two Russell Group universities, I had trouble finding anything and ended up temping. I was applying for better jobs and PhDs the whole time. Then the pandemic happened. Then I finally got offered my dream PhD: fully funded, female supervisor, incredible university, my perfect subject of interest. Less than a month before I started my PhD I was hospitalised with Covid. I got back on my feet and got to work and was doing well. I worked incredibly hard, despite my long Covid. Then my mum got sick, and my brain was all over the place and I wasn't getting as much work done as I wanted to because suddenly I had no mental energy. I had been breathless from long covid for a long time but now the brain fog really started to kick in. My mum died and I took time off. She told me on her goddamn death bed that I had to stick to my PhD; I had to get it. My whole world collapsed and I had to climb out of the pit of despair with my dad throwing rocks at me every few feet. I nearly lost my PhD but I fought tooth and nail to keep it. Literally the only comfort I've had in any of this is my dog, and you want me to get rid of him? He would die of sadness, and honestly so would I.\n\nI am not angry that he has dementia. I am angry that he is mean, and thoughtless, and selfish, and uncaring. I am angry that he has never apologised to me once in his life, that he cannot admit he is wrong, that he cannot even consider someone else could have a valid opinion. I am angry because he is 81 years old and he doesn't know how to be a functioning adult and my siblings have left it to me to bear the brunt of his problems. I am angry because he doesn't care how his actions affect other people.",

People like this feel like eliciting emotions means they've won.\n\nI would leave the kitchen until he cleans it up. If he gets upset, just play dumb and say that you thought he was gonna go back and make more. If he asks you to clean it, say that you would love to but you've got a meeting. If he wants you to meet his new gf, just say that you would LOVE to but you don't wanna intrude on their time or you are SO SORRY but you just have a deadline you have to make that happens to be that day. Just keep repeating that kinda thing over and over again. I truly found that to be my only defense against my dad.\n\nSometimes it will be the case that you have to eat shit and just clean it or grit your teeth, but these little ways of fighting back without 'fighting back' were empowering for me.

The interaction was quick because the restroom opened up and I went in. \n\nLater, I was sitting with my friends at a table and all of a sudden he showed up, stepping between my friend and I. Like very close, literally wedged himself between our chairs. \n\nHe was going on about if we had seen his friends. (I never saw him with anyone.) We were obviously confused and said no. Then he was going on about one of them being in trouble with the cops? He was just rambling. Then he left, not asking anyone else if they\u2019d seen his friends. \n\nAfter about fifteen minutes, we left to go to a small party. I saw him outside the bar and he was telling me to come over to him, but I just said I had to go with my friends to the party.\n\nWhen we got there, I made my way up to the bathroom and the minute after I peed, I felt like a rag doll. I could barely move. I could barely speak. I sat on the bathroom floor, fighting sleep. I felt like I couldn\u2019t breathe properly.\n\nWhat I drank was not enough to even get me to the point of being incapable of anything. It just felt different than being wasted. And trust, I know how my body feels when I\u2019m wasted. \n\nFrom here, my memory is fuzzy. What I remember was my friend getting me off of the floor. She led me down the stairs. I had extreme vertigo, not just drunk dizziness. I walked out with no shoes. I remember sitting on the side walk and not being able to move, literally at war with sleep. \n\nThank god my friend was DDing, other wise I would not have been able to walk home. I remember trying to make myself sick and barely getting anything out. I was panicked, my breathing was short. Then I woke up in bed. \n\nIt was nothing I had ever experienced. \n\nSo anyway, I am convinced my drink was spiked. I don\u2019t know what it could have been?

I have a friend who I have known for probably a decade now and the election has me rethinking our relationship and it\u2019s heartbreaking. \n\nFor the past few years I\u2019ve seen him get closer to conservative family members and start going to church. I was honestly happy for him to get closer to his family and even though I don\u2019t like organized religion it seemed like it was a positive influence in his life. We\u2019ve both been busy with life and haven\u2019t been spending as much time together and the last time i saw him he ended up getting in an argument with a mutual friend because he said he was going to vote for Trump. \n\nI\u2019m really surprised, he\u2019s gay, has mostly female friends, he\u2019s close to his female family members, and I would say he\u2019s usually a very smart and empathetic person. One of our friends has decided to send a whole essay explaining on why Trump is a terrible person because it seemed like he was genuinely uneducated on the details and was just fed things about how he would \u201chelp the economy\u201d. He seemed receptive to listening but it hasn\u2019t changed his mind at all. \n\nI haven\u2019t been too involved in this conversation because I feel like his mind is made up and having more people spamming him with info and opinions on this is not going to make any difference but it\u2019s really upsetting. I am all for respecting differing options but this is a different situation. Neither candidate is perfect but I can not imagine voting for someone who cares so little for a huge portion of the people he is meant to be representing regardless of whether or not I agreed with some of his policies. I can\u2019t help but see it as this friend just completely not caring about the rights of me and all his other female friends and family. \n\nI don\u2019t really have a point here, I\u2019m just really upset and wanted to commiserate with other people who have had similar experiences.

I really enjoyed Orson Scott Card's books and then I found out that he was a homophobe who not only saw homosexuality as a sickness to be cured, but supported programs to do just that. I never read a book by him again, but I know plenty of people who talk about separating the art from the artist. These are people who won't give up anything to adhere to their professed values.

People don't come back from that. It's basically impossible to pull them out of it once they've started sliding, because any attempt to correct the false beliefs that started them down that spiral is seen as a personal attack.\n\nFolks, when a friend or relative demonstrates that they hold right-wing beliefs, you should seriously consider ending that relationship. The world they want is a world that will *harm you,* and will harm others that you care about. The best thing that you can do - both for yourself and for the world at large - is to isolate them and marginalize them so that the damage they can do is limited. You can't save them.

         "Women are emotionally intimate with people with whom they aren't physically intimate, family, friends, etc. Men typically are taught to only be that vulnerable with someone they're physically intimate with. \n\nSo when a woman starts treating a man as an intimate friend, to him, that's foreplay, because their emotional intimacy goes hand in hand with physical intimacy.\n\nIt's very sad, and the answer is to stop making little boys think that they have to not cry, not show vulnerability, not give compliments, not be sweet and loving with the people around them.",

If it didn't work out the first time, why would it work out the second, third, etc. (I've amended it as I've grown older. Given a significant time gap 5yrs+ it might work out due to individual growth, but keep expectations realistic and if the same behaviors persist, bounce.)\n\n2. Never date your friends exes. This applies for the longer relationships, not just a date once or twice thing. Just messy and could really damage friendships.\n\n3. Never date a friend. If they truly approached with friendship, why risk losing that friendship. And if you approached me under the guise of friendship, the \"friend zone\" was self imposed. If you're interested in me romantically, just fucking say so, because I will not date a friend. \n\n\nSoooo many men have felt very strong negative feelings over rule 3. \"Well how else am I supposed to get close to you?\" Maybe try expressing your interest in me romantically/sexually would be a good start? And if you get immediately rejected at least you don't have to claim \"I wasted my time\" and  make me question every friendship's motivation going forward.  \n\n\nYou cannot be \"friend zoned\" if you \"fuck zoned\" me first.",

         "Because we've never gone through it ourselves, or because we've never had anyone really explain to us how they feel afterwards.\n\nOne of the worst things I've ever done is tell a girl at work I didn't want to be her friend because I'd always have feelings for her. It hurt her, bad, especially because I did it at a time when all she wanted was for someone to listen.\n\nWhen I saw her at work a couple days later I was confused about why she'd been so hurt by it. She laid it all out for me and I realized what a jackass I'd been. After hearing what she said, I'll never do it again. I wish I'd never done it at all. But the sad truth is I'd done it at least a hundred times before then, and I'd just never understood the damage I was doing.\n\nEmpathy is hard. I think other girls had explained it to me before her, too, but I wasn't in a place where I was capable of understanding.\n\nI don't have a good answer for why I did it or why I couldn't understand. All I can be is sorry, and sorry is all I am.\n\nEdit: Just realized this didn't really answer your final question, about why it's so bad to be friends when you want to date a girl.\n\nHonestly? I'm not really sure anymore. But that's because I've finally gotten what I'd wanted and never had for so long\u2013I have a girlfriend now, where before I'd never felt my feelings reciprocated. Unrequited love is hard, and it's easy to fall for someone if you've never had a deep or meaningful relationship before. Wanting and not being wanted is a unique type of pain. It's not the worst there is, not by a long shot, but it was nearly the worst I'd felt at that time in my life. (I've been luckier than most.)\n\nI wish I had a better answer for you.

         "A lot of guys can't tell the difference between flirting and being nice where women are concerned. Men typicaply dont get a lot of positive attention from the opposite sex in my experience, so that good feeling can be confused with or transitioned into feelings of affection. Someone pursuing you is going to be more attentive and attuned to you by default. Once you express no romantic interest, there's bound to be less of that. I don't treat my friends the same as my partner(though she is my best friend). That being said, that's no reason for them to be outright mean to you or to ghost you. There's probably an initial recoil from feeling rejected as well, but if they really like you and want to be friends then then hopefully they'd come around. I wish you luck in finding platonic relationships,",
         "It really depends on the relationship and their mentality. If someone is trying and putting the effort for a girlfriend vs making friends with someone. A lot of guys do back off because they are looking for a girlfriend however the type of relationship and pursuit they are looking for might be different and changes because of it. This happens in both ways for men and women but it all depends on the person. Some people rather look for a significant other and might be why a relationship changes. In the end don't put much into someone who acts like this since obviously they don't hold you high on their priorities and its not worth your effort to reconcile this.",

And sometimes you just want to hook up once or twice and move on. I\u2019ve stayed friends with people who developed feelings for me and vice versa, and I\u2019ve had friendships fizzle out after one of us admitted we had feelings for the other and they weren\u2019t reciprocated. I\u2019ve had crushes develop, hooked up, then gone back to platonic friends for a decade or more. It\u2019s sad when one or both parties can\u2019t maintain a friendship due to hurt feelings,       but it doesn\u2019t feel dehumanizing to me. Life is messy and relationships and attraction and love are even more so. \n\nNow of course if someone is intentionally pretending to be your friend, doesn\u2019t actually find you interesting or enjoy spending time with you, just because they want to have sex, that\u2019s something different altogether. But I must admit I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve ever had this happen to me. Most of my straight male friends have expressed interest in me at some point or other in our lives, but I\u2019ve also probably had crushes on them at some point.

Being \"anything zoned\" is messed up. \n\nIf it helps, as a man, I THINK I can help put this into perspective GENERALLY;\n\nImagine finding your person. Whether it be a cute happenstance at the laundry mat, or maybe a CO worker that got put on your team and it turns out you really like them. Not only do you really like them, but DAMN is she/he sexy af! As you talk and get to know each other the more perfect it gets and the more you fall for them.  \n\nThen, you finally get the courage to bring up your feelings to this person and put yourself out there. The day comes and you let your crush know how you feel.... but they unfortunately turn you down and tell you they don't view you sexually or romantically...but they \"still want to be your friend\". Huge bummer. But what do you do now? Most people opt for one of these two options:\n\nOption 1: remain friends. This is LIKELY the better choice that pays out better in the long run but usually VERRRY hard to deal with because now you get to watch your homestar crush date and kiss and talk about alllll these other people to you (because, remember, you're their \"friend\" now and friends talk about this stuff with each other). Now, there are two subroutes this option holds: Route A is you deal with it healthily and let your new friend live their romantic life without you. Totally normal. Route B is.... not healthy and you grow a weird toxic attachment with the mindset of \"well, if I stay friends with them maybe ONE DAY she/he will see my value and come be with me yadda yadda yadda\". Or, even worse, you start finding ways to belittle their boyfriends/girlfriends and basically become \"that person\" who spits hate and gossip and cultivates resentment. It's not good for anyone, including yourself.\n\nOption 2: break contact. This is not a bad option ESPECIALLY if you know yourself to be the kind of person that takes Route B as listed above, or just simply doesnt want to deal with the sadness any longer tham you already currently are. This is a defense mechanism. Nothing more. Sometimes people can present it poorly and it comes off very rudely, but at the end of the day, this person KNOWS that they aren't going to be able to emotionally handle Option 1 and are deciding to nip their emotions in the bud and spare themselves the heartache.\n\nI wouldn't take it so personally. It's sucks, for sure. I've had people like this in my life and been on both sides of this and I'm also the kind of person who usually opts for Option 2 when presented with that scenario. I get very emotionally invested and if someone I'm head over heels for doesn't reciprocate those feelings I HAVE to cut my ties or it will become unhealthy and toxic for both of us. \n\nHope this helps. I don't think it's a \"guy thing\". This is a HUMAN thing.",
         "One thing is that a lot of men don\u2019t have friends the way women have friends, with loving unconditional support. When a woman offers genuine friendship to a man like that, he assumes it\u2019s a romantic thing because it\u2019s deeper than his other friendships or this may even be the only real friendship he\u2019s had\u2014the rest of his friends may just be buddies. So because it\u2019s deeper he erroneously thinks it\u2019s romantic and he ruins the friendship. If men just had deep connections with each other (that they didn\u2019t consider \u201cgay\u201d because again, equating depth with sexuality) then they wouldn\u2019t get so fixated on dating their woman friends.",

         "This is always a fascinating discussion. Men and women just cannot reconcile here.\n\nI cannot comprehend why women find it dehumanizing to have a man you know / like / trust as a friend, to have a romantic interest in you. Why does it hurt to have a person who likes and respects you to also want to share physical intimacy? And why can\u2019t these things exist at the same time for you?\n\nTo men, being friends is good, being romantic partners who are also friends is BETTER. So to us, it often feels like we are advancing the relationship, improving it even. And were often shocked that we read all the signs of interest, but no actual interest in improving the relationship, which can hurt just as much. Being relegated to \u201cI kinda like you but I don\u2019t REALLY like you\u201d doesn\u2019t feel good.\n\nAnd I (41M) have been obsessed with this giant chasm in thought between men and women most of my life. When I was young, my very best friends were women that I was madly in love with, and they just didn\u2019t like me \u201clike that\u201d. When you care for someone in all ways, and they only care for you in some ways, it can feel defeating.\n\nUltimately I think it\u2019s a social issue and the very broad definition of a \u201cfriend\u201d. The way women often define a \u201cfriend\u201d is a relationship that men reserve for romantic partners only. So our guy \u201cfriends\u201d are more like how women define \u201cacquaintances\u201d. So by expanding this, men have ZERO friends, as women define them. So when a woman is friendly with a man, he assumes this is romantic interest because HE ONLY TREATS ROMANTIC INTERESTS THIS WAY.\n\nIf you truly care about this friend, talk to him about it. Don\u2019t assume anything. Try to understand and see his perspective. And you\u2019re not entitled to his friendship anymore than he is entitled to your romantic interest.",
         "Not justifying it at all but as a male I want to raise my thoughts(shocker, right?).\n\nPersonally I've managed to meet a few women, become romantically interested and continued being friends with them even if it didn't work out. \nBut most of the girls I do meet and end up having a crush on, or more, I just can't. It hurts. I cannot move on from some people. Hell I'm still caught up on a girl I went on 3 dates with in February and haven't spoken to since March.\n\nThere will be at least a portion of the times it happens to you where the reason is that the other person need to protect themselves, when you think that might be the case please try not to see it as they only thought of you as a price of meat.",

And I fear that I may accidentally neglect them.  and just the thought of POTENTIALLY neglecting a pet gives me enough dread to choose never to have one. It would crush me emotionally to see something I care so much about suffer because of me.  My empathy is that strong.\n\nExtend that to relationships.  I am surrounded by so many people saying just how horrible men are. and I wont disagree. Ive witnessed it myself.  To a lot of women just having a man talk to her or being nearby her gives her fear.\n\nI dont want to cause anyone fear. fear hurts.    So....  I just chose to never even try to date anyone out of fear that I would cause them distress with my mere presence.\n\nlike the old movie said \"The only winning move is to not play\".   \n\nI can assume that I would of made a great friend to a woman, or that I would of had a great caring relationship.   \nBut the risks are just too high.    I can only assume the \"Good men\" are also the silent ones.   which would become confirmation Bias with all of the \"bad men\" being so loud about their objectification of women.",
         "Go ahead and downvote me, but most of the female friends I (39M) have had has pretty much utilized me as a pseudo-boyfriend only to abandon our friendship the moment an actual boyfriend was in the picture. So no, I\u2019m not actively seeking out more of that.",
         "Here's a question and feel free to downvote. I (39m) often find that I'm drawn to friendships with women. For me, women are easier to get along with. They're real friendships and I like their personalities and I am happy to remain platonic friends. But I usually catch the feels too and long for a romantic relationship with them. I'm nice to them either way. Losing the friendship would be horrible so I've avoided saying anything definitive. \n\nTo me it doesn't make much since to just want to be friends with someone unless you're not attracted to them at all (perhaps they're the wrong gender). Like if you're personality compatible, and you think they're attractive, what else is there? (For the sake of argument, let's assume that existing relationships aren't an issue.)\n\nAnd of course I respect their feelings and don't get worked up if they aren't receptive to my romantic feelings. I assume they know how I feel because I just barely leave room for plausible deniability. \n\nBut I do feel guilty and worry that my feelings make them feel dehumanized.\n\nAm I in the wrong here?",
         "Not to simplify it too much, but men are conditioned to think of women as either sexually available or not sexually available. The world tells us that women who fall into  the first camp are potential mates and women who fall into the second camp (relatives, older women, etc) can be friends (or adversaries). A man's prime directive, according to society, is to spread his seed to as many sexually available women as possible, no matter the consequences. This is largely untrue, but it doesn't feel untrue for a lot of men.\n\nMen also have emotions  and are taught that women will not communicate their desires verbally (sometimes true, because the way that many women are socialized prevents them from asking for what they want directly without fear of being perceived as bossy or picky, subordinating their desires to men's), so they engage with women who are treating them well and assume this is a nonverbal signal that the woman wants a romantic relationship. Many men want a relationship so badly (because it affords them reliable sex, so they think) that they can't see past their desire for sex. They fail to realize that it is healthy to want to be treated well, but not healthy to believe that every woman who treats them well is not an object to be conquered or a potential mate, that in fact most women treat everyone in their lives well because they enjoy interacting with the people in their lives. Some of this is down to testosterone and the profound effect that it has on libido, but a lot of it is baked into the way men, especially young men, are trained to view the world, or rather trained not to question their own motives.",

Whatever reason someone has for not befriending you is just as valid as whatever reason you have for not wanting to date them. We all get to choose what type of relationship we want and with whom. Adults have very limited time and most of us have a hard time seeing our current friends enough. If I befriended every single woman I had a crush on, it would be absurd and I would never be able to maintain a friendship with all of them. So I make choices accordingly, and I don't think this means I should stop seeking a partner just because I don't want more friends. \n\nAlso, staying friends with someone you have a crush on is very often extremely hurtful and emotionally draining.

         "They unfortunately are not aware. The person making that claim was a women who 'went undercover' into male dominated spaces. I copy pasted that chain just a few days ago.\n\n>Simply put, men receive so little positive attention, genuine kindness, and affection from both other men and especially women that if a woman treats a man merely as a \u201cfriend\u201d, with a similar level of intimacy as lady friends, then this is a big spike in affection and positive emotional feedback, which men easily mistake as romantic interest.  \nIf you really want to delve deeper, you may want to check out Norah Vincent\u2019s Self Made Man book which details her experiences during an 18-month experiment \u201cundercover\u201d as a man, infiltrating male spaces (such as bowling leagues or men-only retreats) and even trying to date as a man.\n\nBut aside from that, many men do not, in fact, know better. As in, they literally have not been introduced to the idea, or have been bullied by the people surrounding them into thinking that such an idea is silly and going to get them trampled all over and taken advantage of. Even worse, said state is ENFORCED upon them if they just happen to be born into the wrong group/area. Think of the father who beats the crap out of their son for being too soft. The bully that intentionally goes after others who are less aggressive. The corporate culture. The religions. The politicians. The television. The news.

When someone says 'you can have a meaningful relationship with a girl without sex', everyone around them reacts like they just said 'you can find unicorns if you strip yourself naked and run around in a field'. And this is no accident. They are no happier for this. This is something engineered and propagated by rich elites who found the perfect target for divide and conquer.

She hates being touched so you can't even go as far as holding her hand but you can still develop what I consider to be a real relationship based on understanding, trust, and respect for one another.

         "> Would you have even wanted me to stick around? \n\nYes\u2026? Are men really this emo? Why wouldn\u2019t I want a friend?",
         "Thank you for sharing your experience so people can broaden their understanding of where this comes from! \n\nYeah, I think men have way more trouble than women with emotional intelligence due to patriarchal expectations. Women are raised to feel responsible for managing emotional states, men are raised to feel like they need to be strong/powerful/in control; they are taught men are entitled to get what they want. \n\nThe messaging in our society is that a \u201creal man\u201d who is powerful and in control \u201cwins\u201d: he gets the girl, gets the money, gets the admiration, respect, the life success.   \n\nSo if a woman is rejecting them, many men *feel*:\n\n(1) desperately desirous of connection and intimacy but don\u2019t understand how to facilitate it effectively since they were never expected to consciously develop that skill;\n\n(2) she is wrongfully withholding something rightfully his; success, respect, love, etc;\n\n(3) she is implying he is fundamentally weak/deficient in some way as a person by her rejection;\n\n(4) frustrated due to their inability to self-regulate emotionally and empathize (see things from her perspective), and; \n\n(5) ashamed (internally conflating how badly it feels to have an unmet need with \u201cI *am* bad\u201d; ie. if I am denied my rights and feel bad like this, it *must* be because I am bad and therefore undeserving).  \n\nWhen 1-4 come into contact with 5 (shame) that\u2019s when things start getting *really* dicey. It\u2019s not that individual men actually feel powerful or in control or that they\u2019ve \u201cearned\u201d a right; many men feel powerless (whether they are, compared to any one else, or not)\u2014 it\u2019s that (courtesy of the patriarchy in which we were raised) they feel *entitled* to power, and it is that entitlement that results in this type of escalation.\n\nWomen deal with shame too, but we have different expectations than men in a patriarchal society, and therefore women in such regions feel less entitlement overall, plus it\u2019s with respect to different things. (Women may feel entitled to be presumed trustworthy with unknown children, and not viewed with suspicion sitting alone near a playground, for example.)\n\nAnyway\u2014 starting an analysis from that point, is it any surprise that so many men lash out in their humiliated fury, unable to tolerate such distress? To withdraw to protect themselves (to defend themselves against an attack, since she hurt them first)?   \n\nTo quote Jess Hill\u2019s book, [*See What You Made Me Do*](https://archive.org/details/see-what-you-made-me-do-the-dangers-of-domestic-abuse-that-hill-jess-author-2020), which focuses on the insecure reactor type of domestic abuser (which is non-strategic), and discusses the how and why, as well as possible systemic solutions:  \n\n>As the feminist writer Germaine Greer notes in her essay On Rage, \u201cA red-blooded man is not supposed to take insult and humiliation lying down. He should not let people get away with doing things he thinks wicked or unjust. He demands the right both to judge and to act upon his judgment.\u201d \n\n>As Bren\u00e9 Brown explains, \u201cShame, for women, is this web of unobtainable, conflicting, competing expectations about who we\u2019re supposed to be. And it\u2019s a straitjacket. For men, shame is not a bunch of competing, conflicting expectations. Shame is one: do not be perceived as weak.\u201d\n\n>Men\u2019s pain\u2014especially in relationships\u2014sounds to us \u201clike an indictment of female failure. Since sexist norms have taught us that loving is our task whether in our role as mothers or lovers or friends, if men say they are not loved, then we are at fault; we are to blame.\u201d This sense of failure for women is a major trigger for shame\u2014an unbearable feeling we desperately want to go away. How much room, then, can we allow for men to be truly vulnerable?  \n\n>Now to the next point: shame is not guilt. Guilt is the feeling we\u2019ve done something bad or have wronged someone. When we have guilt, we can apologize and, if we are forgiven, we may be absolved of our guilty feeling. In contrast, no one can absolve you of shame. You have to do that work yourself. That\u2019s because shame is not just a feeling that we\u2019ve done something bad; it\u2019s the unspeakable (and often deeply buried) feeling that \u201cI am bad\u201d\u2014the feeling that we are \u201cunloved and unlovable.\u201d\n\n>Shame is a concept few people understand, so Gilligan lists its synonyms (and there are dozens): being insulted, dishonored, disrespected, disgraced, demeaned, slandered, ridiculed, teased, taunted, mocked, rejected, defeated, subjected to indignity or ignominy; \u201closing face\u201d and being treated as insignificant; feeling inferior, impotent, incompetent, weak, ignorant, poor, a failure, ugly, unimportant, useless, worthless. \n\n>Domestic abuse doesn\u2019t really start with men disrespecting women. Its roots go much deeper: into men\u2019s fear of other men, and the way patriarchy shames them into rejecting their own so-called \u201cfeminine\u201d traits, such as empathy, compassion, intuition, and emotional intelligence. We need to talk about how, for too many men, patriarchy makes power a zero-sum game and shrinks the rich landscape of intimacy to a staging ground for competition and threat.\n\n>For a while, Bruce used this lack of emotional vocabulary as a kind of power. \u201cIf you\u2019ve only got two modes of communicating with someone\u2014one of which is a polite request, the other being violence\u2014the polite request is the threat of violence. And so you can then maintain the self-image of a person who is unfailingly polite, while everyone responds very quickly and actively to everything you ask for.\u201d",

And, yes, people appear more attractive to us as we get closer to them emotionally, I won't argue that.

Women tend to be emotionally open with each other all the time. The majority of women are also straight, and therefore not attracted to each other romantically. In other words - we get lots of practice being emotional in situations that are guaranteed to stay platonic, no matter how close we get. Men are not encouraged to do the same, since masculinity views emotions as \"weak\" or \"gay.\" Even using the word \"gay\" as an insult implies that emotional connection = romance.\n\nI'm asking the commenter above to examine his friendships and see how many women he is emotionally very close to, but would decline if she asked for romance/sex.

         "You are turning the conversation because you want to argue with my answer. The title of this post is asking a question \"Why do men...?\" Women *can't* answer that question for men. I'm just explaining why men *seek* sexual validation from female friends. I'm not arguing the ethics of it. Downvote away, it doesn't change reality. But maybe conversations can.\n\nSimple facts: Men who have no sexual confidence (incels) do not feel safe making advances with strangers in bars. Men want to feel validated sexually. Men feel safe with their friends. Men want to feel validated by a friend they know and trust.\n\nYes, I know how that makes women feel. I know that women don't, in general, want to feel sexually validated by the male friends in their lives. But that wasn't the question. The question was \"why.\" I, personally, have felt those urges in a previous decade and had to suppress those urges for my own ethical reasons. I was also a virgin for way longer than any of my friends. I get why guys take those chances... because it feels safer to *them*.\n\nI think there is a disconnect because so much young sexuality separates dating from friendship, that to many young people sexuality in general feels like a dehumanizing experience. But to others, it is an amazingly humanizing experience to connect sexually with a person you genuinely care about: a friend. It's not about what is owed. It's about asking for what you want: clarifying ones intentions as they develop over time. Relationships and friendships are not necessarily static things.\n\nWhether it's right or wrong, I think that open communication is better than gender segregated echo chambers.",

And you seem to be upset that you\u2019ve lost the benefit of his friendship, so it\u2019s unfair to be entitled to his platonic friendship and simultaneously be upset that he wants a romantic friendship.\n\nI assume he asked you out? That\u2019s not him assuming anything. It\u2019s him acting on his feelings for you and taking a chance. You have rejected him. Which is absolutely your right. Now you\u2019re also demanding that he take this rejection and accept the consolation prize of you not liking him romantically. You\u2019re not entitled to that any more than he is obligated to continue pursuing you as only a platonic friend.\n\nYou said yourself that unrequited love can be painful. Why isn\u2019t he entitled to those feelings of rejection, when his own friend whom he cares for has rejected him. And from a higher level, how is any man supposed to know who is acceptable to approach at all? Which friends are off limits?",
         "Oh no, I get what you're saying, and why you're asking him. My point is just that the nature of the question TENDS to suggest that there is a \"right\" answer. That if, for example, he says \"I have five female friends and I'd only consider sleeping with one of them, I'd decline the rest\", we would then consider him to be \"better\" somehow. More emotionally complex, more genuine, more \"right\", whatever you want to call it.\u00a0\n\n\nBut in reality, there is not a single thing wrong with an answer of \"oh I'd be happy to sleep with any of the five if they were interested\". It is in no way a lesser answer, in no way a sign of a lesser person.\u00a0\n\n\nBeing down to have sex with your female friends is not mutually exclusive to being a feminist, or to being emotionally mature or kind. EXPECTING to have sex is where problems arise. Being friends with someone ONLY IN the hopes of having sex with them is where problems arise. But being WILLING or otherwise interested in having sex with your friends is in no way wrong, so long as you respect that they might not feel the same way, and that's exactly what he mentioned in his original comment.\u00a0",

         "Open communication is exactly what's needed. Honesty is the key. For example, if someone wants compliments because they want to have sex with you, they should be clear about it. And they should also state they think of you only as a potential sex partner - NOT actually a person they want to hang out with, out of friendship, respect and all that. People should be making that crystal clear to each other but that is almost never the case. \n\nSadly, there is a large percentage of women who have experienced nothing but \"friendship\" from men with a hidden agenda: to get laid at any costs. \n\nIt's dehumanising at best, and predatory at worst. Yes, genuine friendships based on respect can bloom into something else and absolutely it's a great way to start a relationship, but it's frustrating and frightening to find that someone you thought was a good friend was only interested in one thing, and actually doesn't care about you as a person. In fact, they're often downright nasty when they get turned down, and the friendship is revealed to be a tool for that person to get laid and nothing else. They don't care about you at all. \n\nWhat's worse is there's a strong correlation between someone who's prepared to lie about why they want to hang out with you, to someone who's not good at taking no for an answer. It stems from a dehumanised view of women. These kinds of guys think women are just prey, and they play devious and clever games to get them into bed, and when those efforts don't pay off... the mask comes off. \n\nHence, women become wary. After all, we get victim blamed so often - why didn't you see that was all he wanted?, etc. etc., and then everyone's left with the shit stick.

You should look somewhere else.\" Walking that line is a tightrope, for reasons that women don't always understand.\n\nFor starters, It's not an abusive mindset. It's an immature mindset. Boys don't know what to do with their feelings, and people don't teach them how to deal with it. Just a list of things they aren't allowed to do or say. And sometimes, we aren't even taught that, depending on where you grow up. The support structure for boys and young men is abysmal. I do my best, but often that makes people angry with me for presuming to be their life coach. We just eventually either learn or we don't. Since turning 30 that issue hasn't come up among anyone I know my age in the past 14 years. Like I said. It's a maturity issue. It's common with teenagers, college age, and incel groups. The sad virgin types.\n\nMen of adult age don't usually hit on their friends unless they are delusional, on drugs, or they have a valid reason to believe the affection is mutual. The first two groups are terribly difficult to break through to.\n\nEditing because the person who asked me a question apparently **blocked** me before I could reply:\n\nBoys and young men experience *intense* feelings when transitioning from childhood, through puberty, into manhood. We are taught to suppress it all, to keep it to ourselves, to not talk about it, to not pursue it, lest we be lambasted for not being strong enough, by both men and women alike. We are taught that our worth is measured in the ability to endure pain, both emotional and physical, while providing work output and earning the right to call ourselves a man *if* we can measure up. And then, if and only then, will we be deemed worthy of love and companionship.\n\nWhere should we start? How about some compassion? How about some listening? How about, before we get to high school, we start talking to young children honestly and openly about sex, dating, and consent, about *how to approach a girl* if you like her in a way that doesn't make her feel uncomfortable, about *how to deal with rejection* in a healthy way, and about how to walk away from friendships if you are no longer able to maintain a platonic bond due to your own feelings?\n\nIt is absolutely true that nobody is owed sexual validation from anybody. It is also true that nobody is owed friendship. We are males and females of a species here. Sexual attraction happens sometimes, sometimes asymmetrically. That doesn't make it *wrong*. It can be inappropriate. We should be able to talk about it with our friends, and if need be, make an adult decision to walk away from the friendship if it's uncomfortable for one or the other of them, mutually and consensually.\n\nNo, we absolutely should not be telling anybody, of any gender, not to have hurt feelings. Hurt feelings are part of life's experiences. We should support those close to us, our friends, siblings, and children, when they have their feelings hurt, so that they can learn to deal with their feelings. It's all part of growing up.\n\nWhen you teach people to suppress what they feel, it turns into a pressure cooker. And that ain't good for anybody.",

      "text": "I have been documenting our interactions since the day I announced my pregnancy but my boss is a huge asshole to pregnant women and mothers and he's so high up nobody will do anything about it. I reported him to HR during my pregnancy but they just said they \"couldn't find any concrete evidence\" despite all the chat logs I sent them of him being passive aggressive towards me and straight up being cruel. \n\nI had another coworker who recently had a baby a few months before me quit only 3 months after returning from maternity leave. Luckily she was able to find a new job but I'm pretty sure he was an ass to her too.\n\nThe problem is, my boss is the VP of our entire business unit and for the past few years, our business unit has been the only one making profit and keeping the entire corporation afloat so I'm pretty sure he feels invincible, and in a way, he is.\n\nHe was extra mad at me because my state pays for 4 months of leave and it stacks on top of the company paid leave so I got a total of 5 months of leave whereas my coworker only got 3 months of leave and 2 of those months were unpaid so she would be \"motivated\" to return to work sooner. He never clearly admitted that's why he was mad, but he very heavily hinted at it in a non-direct way.\n\nI need my income to support my new family, but I feel extremely vulnerable and frankly a bit insulted that this is how it's going to be. I've done nothing wrong. I'm a model employee. I deliver everything with careful detail and on time. I go above any beyond doing rush projects when necessary. Nobody else has any complaints about me. I'm being punished for having a baby whether anyone wants to acknowledge it or not.\n\n\nEdit: for funsies, I've included my favorite ass moments from this guy. \n\n- I was receiving a lot of praise for my work until I announced my pregnancy, then suddenly my performance was \"subpar\" literally the next day.\n\n- He told me it was inappropriate to start crying when I suddenly started miscarrying during a meeting and that I \"should have just taken the day off if I was having a rough time\" as if I knew I would miscarry that day. Bonus! He knew I was suffering from years of infertility! I got pregnant again 2 months later to his dismay.\n\n- I had horrible HG so I was sick the entire pregnancy. He told me we could reschedule a meeting for the afternoon if my morning sickness was too bad. (This one wasn't mean, just an honorable mention for how out of touch this guy is.)\n\n\n- He complained about how many doctor appointments I had due to very high risk pregnancy.\n\n\n- He gave the project I asked for to his favorite employee because I was pregnant and not as \"reliable\".\n\n\n- He asked my coworker if this was her first baby. She told him it was her second. He responded \"Why would you do that?\" In a very not joking manner. \n\n\n- He is now giving me the silent treatment and very short, rude answers to any questions upon my return. Like a child.",
