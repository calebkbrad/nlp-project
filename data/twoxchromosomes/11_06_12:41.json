She\u2019s not a happy person and just wants other women to get punished and \u201cface the same consequences\u201d that she did.

For me there is no \"I got mine\". I am not one of the women in that video where a politician who would never personally produce a baby was baffled that women over 50 would care about a situation they wouldn't be in any more than he would. By that logic, why the hell should he have been so focused on it. \n\nSorry, I am ranting. Just fuck this shit all to hell!

Either by moving, or going off-grid, or just checking out. When everyone who thinks more than two steps ahead ducks out.\n\nLadies, let\u2019s get our own. If you work for these assholes, figure out how to break and start your own business, or work for businesses that support you and lift you up. If you\u2019re in a relationship or a friendship that supported this, show them the door.\n\nI know many of you came to this realization a long time ago, but I\u2019m open and giving, and I genuinely thought his supporters cared if I lived or died.

I\u2019m done with all the unpaid labor, the coddling, and even the conversations and attempts to explain. They don\u2019t get my warmth or jokes or friendship anymore.\n\nWhat these assholes don\u2019t realize is all us crunchy granola hippies DID think about the whole of America and tried like hell to lift everyone up. We were practically begging them to come to the table. But they decided we were against them and now they want to purge us and control us. \n\nLet them burn themselves to the ground, I hope there\u2019s still an America left afterwards. But they\u2019ve made it very, very clear that they don\u2019t want us at the party. So, I\u2019m leaving.

If you think Harris is going to get another 10k Palestinians killed and Trump will get another 100k Palestinians killed, abstaining from voting doesn't absolve you from that extra 90k deaths that wouldn't have happened under Harris.  This doesn't include the body count of those in Ukraine who will die when the country is handed over to Putin and possibly the body count of those who die when Putin decides he can add even more territory to Russia once he has Ukraine.\n\nDespite being very concerned about the military and how it treats its vets, he's allowed into office a man who thinks vets are suckers for serving this country, who wants to get rid of the VA and to gut military benefits, including disability benefits.  \n\nLAMF has become a verb.

I'm talking about those who could've made a difference but decided to just not bother, no matter if their reason was due to not caring, or to thinking they were making a point. \n\nGreat job on being so \"left\" that your \"protest\" (quotes because not voting isn't a protest, it's supporting the wrong side) that supposedly is about people getting unjustly killed is only going to get *more* people unjustly killed, this time in your own country, while not making an iota of difference regarding the cause you claim mattered to you. \n \n(That was a general \"you\", just to be clear, that means anyone who used that flimsy excuse for their reasoning)\n\nNot appearing somewhere where one is expected *can* make a powerful statement. Doing so in the case of voting is however indiscernible from idiocy and cowardice, and the only statement it makes is that they have no fucking clue and don't give a damn about anyone but themselves. A vote is a tool used to shape the society one wants to live in, not a personal bauble to play with and throw away because one doesn't know how protesting something actually works.\n\nThis is uncannily like people voting pro Brexit \"for a laugh\", only much worse because it *will* kill people and *will* quite possibly end Democracy in the US, all the while the people who caused it by throwing away their votes aren't horrified or embarrassed like with Brexit, but instead will feel quite smug and righteous, at least until it bites them in their not-really-leftist-arse.\n\nI'm honestly disgusted.",

That includes this election too. For example - something like Trump should have never even been a candidate at all, regardless of who is willing to vote for him). \n\nhttps://redsails.org/the-pitfalls-of-liberalism/ (to understand why neoliberals are historically and systemically complicit in that violence).\n\n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1884/origin-family/\n(Works of Frederick Engels 1884, The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State, to understand how patriarchy, birth, capitalism and abortions are connected). \n\nBasically, the institution of patriarchal family required, as its foundation, the dominance of the man over the woman and the confinement of all property relations within the family / to secure property inheritance within male lineage. As a result, women were confined to roles of childbearing and household labor, making them \"means of production and reproduction\" to sustain family wealth. This structure arose from the value placed on private property and inheritance, creating social control over women\u2019s labor and reproduction. Capitalism later built on this setup, relying on women\u2019s unpaid domestic labor to maintain a steady workforce, reinforcing male dominance and the exploitation of women to sustain the economic system.\n\n\nIn addition:\n\n1) Read leftist theory. Political education IS important to truly grasp what is happening in your society & why and why it obviously affects you and your rights and so on. \n\n2) Join leftist orgs, in particular marxist feminist orgs in your community, if you have none, start forming them! Endless of women who could never rely on the US settler state and its laws  to protect them or aid them, had to rely through history on mutual aid, being part of a community that shows up for eachother and so on. (That includes underground movements). \n\n(Note: I wanted to make a radical marxist feminist platform on discord, meaning anti western imperial, capitalist and choice feminist nonsense - that does not center straight cis men - anyone is interested, hit me up via PM). \n\n3) Organized protests. No, not holding signs and bs - organized worker protests with demands. You will have to connect across your country, decide on the demands you have and walk out. Walk out of your jobs, your roles as mothers, grandmothers, workers. You all have been the shit pacified while not acknowledging that your BIGGEST weapon is the fact that you make half of your society and if you refuse to do labor for a certain period of time - your society is gonna shake. They rely on your free labor, your physical labor, all of it. \n\n4) Divest from men, build and nurture solidarity and community with other women. Think \"xyz dude is cute\", does he give a fuck about your rights? Does he give a fuck about systemic oppression, history and so on? No? Move on. Stop putting your energy into relationships with men who do not even care for your basic human rights. \n\n5) Divest from sex in any form that can get you pregnant. There are endless of other ways to get off. Maybe that will motivate some of the men in your life to actually give a fck? Probably not hmm. Eitherway, less chances to get pregnant. \n\n6) If that is not a sacrifice you want to bring for more safety and you still want to take more risks, copper IUD, hormonal IUD, hormonal implant, tied tubes & expecting the men in your life to step tf up! Keep in mind that even after vasectomies it might not be safe for months & there needs to be a frequent visits to make sure sperm count is in order (plus still use condoms in addition to make sure you are safe). Never center short term convenience and pleasure over your physical safety in a society that will treat you as an incubator and is more than willing to see you dead.\n\n7) Pregnancy strike. I am not sure how any woman is still willing to pop babies... but those ideologies and rules are not only for women who don't want kids. If you want kids you are not automatically \"safe\". It could still get you killed. Consider that. \n\n8) Do not automatically trust your family, partner or doctors or anyone, if you deal with unwanted pregnancy. \n\n9) Don't leave any traces or records online those track your period & could potentially be used to incriminate you.\n\n10) Consider moving to another country if it is something you can afford. \n\n11) Have an emergency fund if that is something you can afford.\n\n12) Train & arm yourself.\n\n13) if you were contemplating divorce - go for it now",

         "Yup. As a non-American, I'm terrified. For the Paris climate agreement, for Ukraine and the knock-on effects in Europe, for Trump's impulsive and unpredictable foreign policy more broadly and for America's women. There is no silver lining here, it's just all awful.",

I was worried when the Dems picked Kamala and not a man for no other reason than I did not think men would vote for a woman.\n\nMinority men and recent immigrants (1st and 2nd gen) are among the least likely to vote for a woman.

         "Don\u2019t underestimate his base. There are a lot more Trump supporters out there than you realize. I have no doubt those numbers are real. I hate it and it\u2019s admittedly hard to accept that I have to live in this country knowing that most people feel the way that they do, but it seems this is our reality. I\u2019m really sad. I take comfort in knowing that at least I\u2019m not alone in my sadness. Fuck.",

There was someone with a \u201cI\u2019m voting for the felon\u201d t-shirt and the poll workers didn\u2019t do a damn thing.  \n\nMy daughter\u2019s ballot was rejected and she had to fill out a new one. The machine stated my ballot had jammed the machine but they assured me it had been counted and that the machine was just too full.",

He\u2019s the symptom of a cancer in the country..or worse, the world. The previous elections  I thought these people were just uninformed but now I can\u2019t even believe they\u2019re good people. What\u2019s their moral floor?\n\nOne person told my wife she hated Trump but felt she had to vote for him because ChatGPT affirmed her beliefs on abortion. She listed all the terrible things he\u2019s done but says they don\u2019t matter to her. How do you argue with that?\n\nHow do i reconcile that we reward rape and treason with the highest office in the world with the voters are good in their hearts?",

It's bad enough that this a-hole is back in office but just think that the people who support him are all over America. \n\nTrump won't face sentencing for his charges either. I read a little while back that it would be a huge problem to have a president in prison. Trump will pardon himself and I can't even finish my thought. I'm so disgusted.",

I remember the only politics we really learned in early elementary school is \"This is the president! He's elected by everyone and leads the country.\" I still remember who was president when I was in kindergarten through second grade. For our toddlers, that will be Donald J. Trump. Ugggggh",
         "It's shocking how many women went Trump",
         "That\u2019s what I don\u2019t understand. Why did so many women vote for him? I\u2019m very disheartened. I just want some sliver of hope this country will not be completely ruined in four years.",

         "Interesting and sorry to read about your STBX. That is very disappointing. I think I might also have a STBX who proudly voted for Kennedy cuz he's the \"most viable third-party candidate.\" \ud83e\udd22 He didn't understand why I was nervous about the election cuz he \"finds it difficult to get worked up about outcomes he can't control.\" For context, I have a daughter and also work for the fed govt. I'm literally a trained, formally-educated, and practicing political scientist who was horrified by Jan. 6th and alllllllllll of the racist, xenophobic, misogynist, trans- and homophobic garbage that has come from the right for several yearsssssss now. So yeah, I'm a little anxious about turning the clock back on basic human rights for my daughter and everyone else who isn't a cishet white Christian male. \n\nBut gawd forbid I pooh pooh his little football game outcomes.

Not saying they\u2019re swaying the election, but Trump definitely appeals to these angry men (who are angry despite not recognizing the patriarch that has controlled the entire world since the beginning of time has put them there in the first place but instead would rather blame women) I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m a bit drunk and just so sick of it all in my mid 40s. \n\nLike, my great grandmother was alive when women first got the vote. She told me the stories even though she was only 12. And now there are people who believe the 19th should be repealed, and as much as it hurts, this country has chosen a RAPIST (he also probably raped a 13 year old girl at Epstein\u2019s and they want to scream about protecting children) twice-impeached felon conman over two very qualified, educated women, one a woman of color. This speaks volumes. They hate us.",
         "Yup, ignoring the domestic implications, Trump winning effectively means the end of the post-WWII world order. What replaces it, given the current state of things will likely be worse for everyone but autocrats.\n\nIt also means climate change will only get worse, wars of conquest are fully back on the table, and because of that previous point, nuclear proliferation will rapidly expand as the only way to keep from being invaded will be to secure nuclear weapons. The crazy part is, this would also include countries like Canada and Mexico because when the economy inevitably goes to shit fascists tend to start invading their neighbors to distract from things.",

One referee says we should all play without pads, the other says we should all play without pads AND add spikes to the puck. \n\nAbstainers say \"I don't actually like hockey so I'm not going to choose\" but unfortunately that's immaterial because everyone has to play regardless.",
         "No. It's honestly worse than that. Honestly, a lot of people said \"Well, yeah. My gas is too expensive though, so I am willing to accept this\".\n\nIt is honestly the same as guns. People love guns enough, they are willing to believe any BS about video games or mental health while kids die in schools.\n\nAt the end of the day, it is selfishness. and large part of the voting block just doesn't believe it will happen to them.",

Maybe that is naive and uninformed of me. I don\u2019t know. I need to have hope that America will reject Project 2025. I need to have hope in my fellow Americans.",
         "I think it was just the opposite. \n\nThe poll, known for accuracy, scared people shitless that trump might actually lose, so they either turned out more or changed their votes. \n\nPoll announcements change behaviour. Accurate, reliable polls even more so.",

I saw an Indian comedian on Reddit today that was saying how misogynistic his community could be, and I believe it. Harris was *way* less problematic than Hilary Clinton (whom I voted for too) and I\u2019m not sure she really had a chance against \u201csuper macho man\u201d even though he is clearly in mental decline and has so many physical problems I don\u2019t want to take the time to list them. People would rather have a racist rapist than a woman, no matter her color.

         "> I worried from day one that this country would have an issue with a woman candidate\n\nIt wasn't just that. The Democratic party fucked this up big time. They tried to make the election about something most Americans don't understand (an existential crisis of civics) and gave in to business interests. The GOP ran on \"specific bad people are coming to get you\" and the Democrats ran on \"bad things will infect the body politic.\" The GOP ran on \"things were cheaper four years ago\" and the Dems ran on \"wait, what economy?\"\n\nAt least Hillary won the popular vote, *more Americans voted for her in 2016 than Trump.* This is the first time the GOP candidate has won the popular vote since 2004. And only the second time since 1984. The Democrats messed up.\n\n> The Democratic National Convention in August was roundly acclaimed as a great success, presenting a unified front [\u2026] Over the past few weeks, however, Harris has dropped in the polls, and heading into Election Day, many Democrats feel less than confident.\n\n> What\u2019s going on? A poll of 1,000 Pennsylvania voters from the Center for Working-Class Politics (CWCP), Jacobin, and YouGov shows that the campaign was tentatively heading in the right direction this summer.\n\n> In late August, the historian Eric Foner wrote that Democrats were attempting to make the election about competing definitions of freedom \u2014 about, as Tim Walz said in his acceptance speech, \u201cthe freedom to make a better life for yourself and the people that you love,\u201d against the freedom of corporations \u201cto pollute your air\u201d and banks to \u201ctake advantage of customers.\u201d UAW president Shawn Fain went even further at the national convention in naming and blaming the villains that stand in the way of a better life for working people: \u201cCorporate greed turns blue-collar blood, sweat, and tears into Wall Street stock buybacks and CEO jackpots,\u201d he argued, adding that Trump was a \u201cscab\u201d who would protect the interests of corporations and billionaires. That same month, the campaign announced a series of commitments to tackle the housing shortage, crack down on price gouging, and raise the minimum wage.\n\nOur survey found strong support for this kind of economic populist messaging and widespread antipathy for billionaires and corporate elites, especially among constituencies that Harris has struggled to reach \u2014 union members, voters without a college degree, and blue-collar voters, with whom Harris was trailing by 4, 7, and 19 points respectively in our poll. Despite these clear findings, Harris has pivoted away from anti-elite, economic messaging in the last month of the campaign and backtracked or de-emphasized some of her more popular policies in response to pressure from the business community.\n\n> Democrats have once again decided to place the very risky bet that catering to moderate, college-educated voters will win more support than it loses in working-class defections. Leading up to election day, they\u2019ve put most of their chips on a message that warns voters of the threat posed by a second Trump presidency. If our study\u2019s results are any indication, it\u2019s a gamble that could backfire massively.",

I've dealt with sexism and misogyny my whole goddamn life, and I'm sick of it.\n\neta: I'm old enough to remember watching Geraldine Ferraro run for VP and how electrified I felt watching her, even as she was so reviled by people who thought she couldn't and shouldn't run. I remember how much I wanted her to win. I remember thinking, \"My GOD, that's something to look up to. That's someone I want to be like!\" \n\nI want little girls and young women to look up to Harris like I looked up to Ferraro and know that this was possible and even though she didn't make it, it wasn't because of her but because of sexism. We need to ban together and fight back. We're stronger together. We're better together. They should not divide us. We cannot afford to let them.",
         "> I may never move the needle on misogyny and women\u2019s issues personally, but damn it, I\u2019ll never give up and say \u201cit\u2019s okay, that\u2019s just how it is.\u201d\n> It\u2019s not okay, and I\u2019m still gonna be mad about it, even if it stays how it is.\n\n\n\nThank you for putting this into words, this is what I needed to hear today.\n\n Funny thing is, this defeatist sentiment reminds me of watching my mom get verbally abused by my dad, and in turn, she and my other two siblings would verbally abuse me.  After seven long years of this, I finally realized it was extraordinary, that this was not how a family was supposed to act, we weren't supposed to be tearing at each others throats all the time and one time when I was serving once more as the family chew toy, I had enough, and demanded to know how she could act so ruthlessly to her own flesh and blood. She couldn't look me in the eye, but just said something to the effect of \"you'll understand when you have kids.\" She, at least in the moment, denied that she had agency and was actively choosing to be abusive and to stay with an abuser. Retrospectively, this is what caused the first major depressive episode of my life.\n\nShe did leave him later that year, one of the happiest moments of my life, and I like to think it was partially my obstinance that gave her the courage to do so, though she's never admitted as much.  I think she's still angry at me because I gave him the benefit of the doubt when I saw him.... humbled for the first time in my life.  I never thought before meeting him for the first time after the divorce that I'd ever feel even the tiniest drop of sympathy for that man, but there he was like a wounded animal, my father being polite, kind and most surprising of all, respectful, to me in a way none of the rest of my family ever once acted towards me, not that it lasted very long, but I had no way of knowing that at 7 years old.\n\n  My mom never forgave me for forgiving him, not even 15 years later at his funeral, she just made some snide remark towards me about him I can't even remember the details of besides the pain of old wounds being callously opened again. It's okay though, I don't know everything he put her through, so I can't exactly judge her.\n\nThinking back though, that feeling you mention about never thinking we'll actually move the needle but refusing to give up, that was the feeling that got me to speak up, and it was the tiny ember that smoldered within me no matter how powerless I felt as a kid.  I am not them, I would not do what you are doing to me at seven years old.  In my darkest moments, when I feel everything is lost, I just whisper to that seven year old little boy, \"don't worry, she's wrong. you'd never be her, you're better than that.\" and it always gives me at least a little bit more strength.",

Honestly, expecting straight women to not love men *at all* as a political choice is just as crazy as conservatives expecting gay people to ignore their true orientation and roleplay being straight.

Treating babies as a resource womankind should withhold from men ignores the fact that we'd also be withholding them from ourselves.\n\nSorry, just my two cents.

That includes this election too. For example - something like Trump should have never even been a candidate at all, regardless of who is willing to vote for him). \n\nhttps://redsails.org/the-pitfalls-of-liberalism/ (to understand why neoliberals are historically and systemically complicit in that violence).\n\n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1884/origin-family/\n(Works of Frederick Engels 1884, The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State, to understand how patriarchy, birth, capitalism and abortions are connected). \n\nBasically, the institution of patriarchal family required, as its foundation, the dominance of the man over the woman and the confinement of all property relations within the family / to secure property inheritance within male lineage. As a result, women were confined to roles of childbearing and household labor, making them \"means of production and reproduction\" to sustain family wealth. This structure arose from the value placed on private property and inheritance, creating social control over women\u2019s labor and reproduction. Capitalism later built on this setup, relying on women\u2019s unpaid domestic labor to maintain a steady workforce, reinforcing male dominance and the exploitation of women to sustain the economic system.\n\n\nIn addition:\n\n1) Read leftist theory. Political education IS important to truly grasp what is happening in your society & why and why it obviously affects you and your rights and so on. \n\n2) Join leftist orgs, in particular marxist feminist orgs in your community, if you have none, start forming them! Endless of women who could never rely on the US settler state and its laws  to protect them or aid them, had to rely through history on mutual aid, being part of a community that shows up for eachother and so on. (That includes underground movements). \n\n(Note: I wanted to make a radical marxist feminist platform on discord, meaning anti western imperial, capitalist and choice feminist nonsense - that does not center straight cis men - anyone is interested, hit me up via PM). \n\n3) Organized protests. No, not holding signs and bs - organized worker protests with demands. You will have to connect across your country, decide on the demands you have and walk out. Walk out of your jobs, your roles as mothers, grandmothers, workers. You all have been the shit pacified while not acknowledging that your BIGGEST weapon is the fact that you make half of your society and if you refuse to do labor for a certain period of time - your society is gonna shake. They rely on your free labor, your physical labor, all of it. \n\n4) Divest from men, build and nurture solidarity and community with other women. Think \"xyz dude is cute\", does he give a fuck about your rights? Does he give a fuck about systemic oppression, history and so on? No? Move on. Stop putting your energy into relationships with men who do not even care for your basic human rights. \n\n5) Divest from sex in any form that can get you pregnant. There are endless of other ways to get off. Maybe that will motivate some of the men in your life to actually give a fck? Probably not hmm. Eitherway, less chances to get pregnant. \n\n6) If that is not a sacrifice you want to bring for more safety and you still want to take more risks, copper IUD, hormonal IUD, hormonal implant, tied tubes & expecting the men in your life to step tf up! Keep in mind that even after vasectomies it might not be safe for months & there needs to be a frequent visits to make sure sperm count is in order (plus still use condoms in addition to make sure you are safe). Never center short term convenience and pleasure over your physical safety in a society that will treat you as an incubator and is more than willing to see you dead.\n\n7) Pregnancy strike. I am not sure how any woman is still willing to pop babies... but those ideologies and rules are not only for women who don't want kids. If you want kids you are not automatically \"safe\". It could still get you killed. Consider that. \n\n8) Do not automatically trust your family, partner or doctors or anyone, if you deal with unwanted pregnancy. \n\n9) Don't leave any traces or records online those track your period & could potentially be used to incriminate you.\n\n10) Consider moving to another country if it is something you can afford. \n\n11) Have an emergency fund if that is something you can afford.\n\n12) Train & arm yourself.\n\n13) if you were contemplating divorce - go for it now",

Yes, IMHO definitely avoid and shut down intimacy with someone who voted red (or, honestly, just didn't vote). But also, make it clear what you *are* looking for. That you find men who stand up for your rights as a woman sexy. That men who refuse to do so are weak and not worth your time. Don't just punish guys who are assholes, but reward men who respect and support women. Maybe do what you can to help it so guys know that it's sexy and attractive when a guy stands up for causes that back-up female rights. Punishing the a-holes who let this kind of thing happen, while probably what is deserved, might not be enough. Honestly, I think that kind of plays into their feelings of victimhood and they'll just lean into dismissing female rights and concerns even more. Maybe consider making it abundantly clear that there is a positive way forward for them to go if they want relations with women. I don't know, I'm no expert, and I'm genuinely sad that so much of our country is so comfortable with women being treated with disrespect and as less than.

         "I feel like you misunderstod my post. I'm not saying women shouldn't withhold sex \"to avoid looking like prudes.\" I really don't care about how men perceive us. I care about our side and what the idea of a sex ban implies for women.\n\nI'm saying that expecting women to \"withhold sex\" assumes that sex \u2014 and romantic love, more importantly \u2014 is something most of can and should be expected to cut out of our lives. To me, this idea echoes the sexist thought you see in conservative religious and incel spaces that women have this cool detachment from sex \u2014 that we aren't sexual creatures  like men are, that we can just decide to be \"\"\"pure\"\"\" and celibate without losing something important about ourselves and our humanity. That sex isn't a part of our humanity. Sex isn't just about fun. It is about love. And love is part of our humanity. \n\nPersonally, I can't give that up.  I can't give up love, and I won't. I love my partner, he loves me. He's as torn up \u2014\u00a0if not more \u2014\u00a0about what's happening than I am. He isn't the problem. A lot of individual men aren't the problem. I have a lot of rage at men as a class, but I don't hate the individual men I know who are good allies now just because they're men.\n\nDo I think women should be in partnerships with men who don't respect their humanity and who vote and act against their rights? Absolutely not. Do I think women should consider very carefully who they get into relationships with and effecitvely trust with their lives? Yes. I just find the idea of a blanket ban on heterosexuality pretty ridiculous.  \n\nI definitely have empathy. I wouldn't have kids in the US right now. But I understand that some women will still choose to risk their lives having kids *because the risk is personally worth it to them \u2014* and yes, some women already willingly do this already, i.e. people choosing to go forward with risky multiples pregnancies and other high-risk pregnancies. I don't see those women as gender traitors. I see them as sisters who made a choice I wouldn't. And I empathize with women who feel they cannot be in any relationship with any man right now. I just would hope that those women would extend the same empathy to their sisters who cannot or will not make the same choice. \n\nI hope that's a bit clearer.",

         "That's a great point, and probably something that I didn't really word properly. I 100% am supportive of a woman who feels the need to take those steps to protect themselves, especially after last night. It's horrible that women have been put in a position where feeling the need to take those steps is needed, but here we are. I'm just trying to say that there could be a route to improving things in the future (possibly). I was trying to emphasize that it might also be helping yourselves out when guys know that women find men who are respectful and supportive attractive. That it might be helpful to also be loud and proud about that. A shocking number of guys don't believe or get that (we're dumb). I understand that women can and should take the appropriate steps to protect themselves. But maybe, celebrating and being open to intimacy with guys who are good guys, letting people know that is sexy might help other guys behave better? And thus, treat women better? I hate that I even feel the need to talk about guys this way, but clearly we are dumb and need to be treated as such. Women can wield a lot of power in how guys act. It's dumb and stupid that on top of worrying about just protecting themselves, they also might spend time on protecting guys from themselves. I don't know. I'm just trying to think about some things that can be done to change male behavior, and getting them to understand that being a guy who is supportive of women is hot could be one way. While I don't see not being intimate with guys as punishment, demagogues will paint it that way and plenty of dummies out there (like the next president) will eat it up. And guys interpreting women as \"holding out on them\" for whatever reason makes them more inclined to be even more misogynist. It might be more effective to focus on what is hot than what is not.\n\nIt's extremely juvenile and annoying, but I assume that dealing with guys usually is. Again, I want to reinforce that I'm not trying to tell you how it is or anything. It's just a really bad place society is in, and I guess I'm trying to find some path towards a better place for us to pursue.\n\nEdit: Grammar.",

I've detailed that in other posts in that thread, so I won't go into that here.\n\nSince you bring up the need to do a sex strike for tactial reasons, I'll comment on that instead. I disagree that a sex strike will accomplish anything in terms of getting men to change. I predict that it would just make them hate us more. And the right has all the political power right now. We cannot win it back without at least some male allies \u2014\u00a0and we *do* have male allies. There *are* good men who see us as full, equal humans and care for our rights. Cancelling heterosexuality is not the solution. It's making a large-scale social problem into a personal one that will unfold on the level of individual people who, themselves, might have literally nothing to do with the problem. And women have power outside of the bedroom. It's sexist to see sex as our only value or power, from my perspective. We have economic power, for one. We can vote with our wallets and our feet, we can move to states that prioritize our rights and take our talents to feminist employers and our dollars to companies that don't court the regime. We can organize, and we can seek to build bridges instead of burning them down. To get out of this, we need allies. Not enemies. Taking sex away from men will not make them any less capable of legislating our rights away \u2014 and might very well encourage them to do exactly that, in part by validating the incel worldview. \n\nI understand and fully support women making the personal choice to withdraw from men or be childfree for their own safety \u2014 or for any reason.

There's an issue I keep seeing with \"the left\" - this idea of having perfect/pure solutions. We'd still be living in a misogynistic world even if Kamala had won, a sex strike is not going to change men, but it is leverage. It's not a punishment for men who are allies - they of all people should be understanding.\n\nNow, I am not OP, so my version of a sex strike is more \"no sex with men who haven't and do not continue to do the hard work of deconstructing patriarchy\" plus the other Bs of the 6B movement. If the 'other side' already has a misogynistic view of sex, especially one that associates it with power, rightfully or wrongly, it is still a position of leverage that women hold and should use. Resistance is either figuring out how to exploit the hand we're dealt, or destroying it completely - it always costs something, it requires sacrifice and it is not cozy. I am more concerned with whether or not it will work.\n\nYou've predicted that it won't and that it will make men hate women more -respectfully, that's an opinion, not a fact and those men already hate us and there are plenty of women who will never stop centering men so it's not like their supply of sex will stop. In recent history, it worked in Liberia, as I'm sure you know. For the women that are happy with these results, they're delulu and will assume that life is only getting better for them, whether it does or not doesn't matter to them.

But if a woman doesn't come across those facts and educates herself on the topic, then it's easy to fall for the scam.",

It literally takes a room with a chair-table-tv and pc/console to make a single man happy and all that is easy to get without putting too much efforts. If that's the only option they get for having peaceful life, they will choose it and work until their needs are met resulting in work degradation throughout the country, which will make everything more expensive which will result in worse life in general for everyone.

Biden also unfortunately (I guess?) handed off an economy that's doing pretty darned well, which Turd will claim to have done.\n\nCouple that with the mind-boggling obsession with the border, and presumably plenty of idiots being scared of a non-white woman being the head of state, and here we are.  \n\nIt's just disgusting, heartbreaking, etc, on so many levels.  Let's kiss Ukraine goodbye.  Who knows what the fuck will happen with Palestinians.  The obvious things you mentioned.  Rollbacks of environmental protections.

It\u2019s a good gauge for the general support of a candidate, but not necessarily indicative of who will win.\n\nThat said, 3rd party votes matter so so so much. Look at Pennsylvania. In Erie county PA the difference between DT and KH was about 1900 votes. Stein and the Libertarian candidate made up about 1240 votes and about 300 were write-ins.

Seeing the results today has been soul crushing. I don't think I can believe in humanity, even after seeing what we can do. It's heart breaking how so many can vote and ignore the context of it, or choose not to vote. History is pretty dark, and seeing the U.S. embrace someone so openly fascistic and such an awful human, while also hearing what the goals of his party are in Project 2025... I want to do what I can to keep pushing forward, but today is just grieving. Hugs to everyone here.",

Unfortunately it will probably be too late. America is just too big to not have an eventually cataclysmic fall and we are watching it in action. Slow and insidious destruction of freedom in service of racism and misogyny.  \n  \nMany will die as they did during the last Trump presidency, I may be one of them. But at least we now know without a shadow of a doubt where we stand. Women and minorities dying is something a majority of this country is okay with. I think we all knew under the surface this is what America was, but we had hope we could defy it.  \n  \nWe always wonder how countries turn into dictatorships and complete dystopias, always assuring ourselves \"not in America\". If anything, it proves we are no different than a large portion of the world. There is no American exceptionalism. We can just as easily slip into fascism like we have seen happen again and again elsewhere.  \n  \nAll I can say is we need to put all of our energy into what we can control. What we have right in front of us. We need to be ready to defend each other and ourselves. For those that can afford to move out of the country, I wish you wouldn't, but that is selfish of me and I totally understand where you are coming from. For those of us that stay by choice or by necessity, we have to watch out for each other. We need to lower our walls for our sisters and try to be the safety we deserve. Now is the time we stop thinking about having families and start thinking about what we can do to help the generations that will have to suffer beyond us.  \n  \nThis may be violence, this may be peace, or this may be somewhere in the middle. We can no longer lie to ourselves that good will prevail at least in the short term. We have to be ready for what is to come and shedding our American idealism for good is the first step and seeing this country for what it really is.

BUT...abortion must be addressed state by state and get out of the hands of legistlators who end up criminalizing medical needs and really- if \"ok for rape and incest\" that's just male outrage. The Missouri law that passed is a sign of the way to go. I know a lot of women, esp younger will disagree with me but I respect where you're coming from.

That means girls and young women prioritizing education and career tracks that lead to higher paying jobs and financial freedom. We don\u2019t have the luxury to pursue careers out of passion. We don\u2019t have the luxury to prefer work-life-balance / flexible working in exchange for lower pay. We need to stop doing unpaid labor (eg caretaking duties) and underpaid labor (eg teaching) for our own sake. Men are already whining about girls and women outperforming them in schools and universities - how about we push that into the workforce as well. Whatever field you are in, aim for the highest paid / most respected / highest potential path. The sooner you are not financially reliant on your partner / family, the sooner you are free: free to escape bad relationships, free to move to blue states. Eventually with economic success, you\u2019ll also be free to financially support the business and causes that you do believe in. \n\nLook at how men have been amassing money and power and influence over the past centuries. We need to play the same game to catch up. Simply being celibate to spite a handful of men is not going to do anything to shift power.",

         "Obligatory -- I am a cismale who voted for Kamala Harris (because I'm not insane)\n\nWhile I will agree that Kamala Harris being a woman is something that held her back (because of sexist assumptions of a woman's role), I believe that several other issues were far more important in her loss:\n\n(1) About 1/3 of Americans would vote Republican no matter who is at the top of the ticket and, accordingly, Kamala had to attract low-information, disengaged voters who vote in a less regimented way who will often fail to understand or consider complex arguments, so bear that in mind for the subsequent points.\n\n(2) Kamala inherited (from Biden) a period of inflation for common goods. Now, we know that this inflation was (a) less than in many other countries and (b) a direct result of the stimulus to avoid crashing the economy during the pandemic, but these complex arguments are not swaying the low-information, disengaged voter.\n\n(3) Kamala inherited (from Biden) the pandemic lockdowns and many low-information voters were angry that they couldn't move around as they might like.\n\n(4) Kamala only did 10-or-so major interviews, preferring to spend her time on the campaign trail doing rallies. This prevented people from seeing her respond to different questions and becoming familiar with her. Psychology repeatedly shows that people will choose someone whose name they recognize and who they feel familiar with EVEN IF they hate this person rather than a person that they don't feel that they know. One of the things that Obama made sure to do (and Trump also did) was heavily engage with both legacy media interviewers and social media interviewers that could create the sense of familiarity and allow the candidate to field more nuanced and individualistic questions.\n\n(5) Psychological studies have also shown that \"protecting democracy\" is actually not a very compelling argument for low-information voters, most of whom don't understand how democracy works and generally dislike the idea of governmental negotiations taking time and resulting in compromised outcomes. These people prefer an authoritarian who can \"get things done\" rather than this more consultative process. Additionally, since they are not political, they don't actually worry about the \"high-minded\" political issues but care more about tangible changes in their lives. (It's the \"Is your life now better than 4 years ago?\" question.)\n\n(6) On the other end of the spectrum, many more politically-astute voters were waiting to hear more details on Kamala's policies, especially since they diverged so strongly from her positions in 2020. She did not clarify why she flipped on these positions. So, it meant that when she spoke about women's rights (for example), she sounded genuine -- since she has consistently held this position -- and when she spoke about foreign policy (for example), she sounded like a pre-programmed soundbyte machine -- since her foreign policy position changed significantly sicne 2020.",

Resistance in large numbers is so, so SO critical from here forward. People have got to let go of the fantasy that fascists can be reasoned or compromised with, have empathy to be appealed to, any of it. \n\nI\u2019ve been very disturbed how conplacent or clueless some are - it terrifies me some miss the gravity, or simply lack the guts to defy, subvert and fight on a riskier, yes, but actually consequential level, when standing up for our rights and what is right, requires more than the familiar, widely accepted, and comfortable. I\u2019m talking about the pearl clutching for civility when some think others have gone too far, got too angry. How every fucking thread on here where someone might need or want an abortion, it seems someone is like \u201coh well, might be illegal where she is.\u201d Nothing about the possibility of getting the meds by mail or underground network, or traveling (seeking financial and logistical support from loved ones and/or groups that assist with). Like, WHO GIVES A FLYING FUCK it\u2019s illegal (besides that it shouldn\u2019t be, duh). We still have a right to travel out of state and country - and if they come for that, frankly to me that\u2019s a get out and stay out if you can, even if you have to seek asylum, level of threat. I know if I got pregnant, nothing will stop me getting UNpregrant stat. And if people had just rolled over and accepted terrible laws in past extremist regimes, where the fuck would that have gotten things? Resistance is CRITICAL. \n\nI don\u2019t have all the answers how exactly to subvert and fight to protect ourselves and other vulnerable folks as best we can. I think just starting such work - getting focused, connect to likeminded people, put initial strategy together and into action - can be one of the hardest bits, even more at the outset of threat still being processed emotionally. But I\u2019m not a total neophyte, I\u2019ve strengths and privileges to leverage - hell knows rebellion and fighting  bullies and injustice are hardwired into the core of who I am.  \n\nAnd I\u2019m fucking angry. Have been a while. In one sense, my whole life in a female, mixed race body. It\u2019s not about me more than anyone else that doesn\u2019t tick the white male hetero Christian boxes (or complicit Mrs BangMaidMommy\u2019s) but this is extra galling in a way with half my family being Indian/Caribbean Black like Harris. I\u2019m half white and hard to place without context, but  Photoshop her in a family pic on that side and it\u2019s wild how she\u2019d blend in like a younger auntie or older cousin. And two things have radicalized me in recent years (besides, you know, the news). A fight for healthcare for an otherwise life altering issue, which with getting into advocacy for gave me a whole new view of abusive systemic corruption here. And having to divorce my ex who became abusive - poisoned if not by the rest of alt right ideology, but manosphere misogyny.\n\nWords that feel anemic for how chilling that was.    I thought I had the measure of misogyny: musician since teens, raped in college, all the shit heard from friends or news. Was like I\u2019d formed my view standing on trapdoors that gave out. Wasn\u2019t physical til the very end losing his shit with losing me and basically held me hostage for a week at home. I think any abusive behavior by someone meant to love you (that has, and very possibly still acts like it between blowups) can trigger incredible cognitive dissonance. The depths of aggression and sadism at the end though\u2026 and even before, loss of ability to see me as I was thru the garbage in his mind, increasingly sexualizing everything, weaponizing sex to control and degrade. All unimaginable when we dated/married, and 20 fucking years before as friends. Thought I knew who the real scumbags in our circles were - never my nice, supportive friend that was pretty  involved in activism with all the big leftist concerns - antiracism, civil and human rights (women\u2019s included), economic and climate justice and such. 2+ years and a LOT of learning about DV, and still so much I haven\u2019t made sense of, but it\u2019s forever changed how I see men (some - but how do you really know before they inflict harm and it\u2019s a whole thing to extricate yourself) and relationships with.",

That is very telling.\n\nWe are seeing a combo of\n\n- Wholesale rejection of progressive social stances by centrist/moderate voters, including white women, college educated, and POCs/Latinos. These policies have *never* been popular with the majority; doubling down on them and making them so visible and central to policy is a vote-loser for Democrats. You simply cannot convince a majority of people that men are women, mass immigration is good, and that every last thing is either racist or transphobic or misogynistic. There are also many economically left wing people who do not subscribe to extremely these progressive positions. The bud light Dylan Mulvaney backlash is an example of how deeply unpopular these stancesare with a huge number of people. This is unfortunate but it's the reality - a \"do you want to be right, or do you want to win?\" situation for Dems. \n\n- 8 years of right wing social media indoctrination of young men (funded by various nefarious actors). The results of this are absolutely frightening \n\n- Economic illiteracy and people being unable to understand that inflation was not caused by the Dems and that an R vote is going to make the economic inequality caused by late stage monopoly capitalism worse.\n\nDems do not seem to understand that people vote on emotion rather than logic. Rs have been very good at harnessing that to get people to vote against their economics for decades now. Until they dial back on identity politics and start campaigning heavily on inequality and how Rs are the party of the rich and how their policies screw over the working and middle class then they're not going to win big at election time and time soon\n\nWriting this off as a \"people wouldn't vote for a woman\" situation is far too simplistic.",

They don't want anything bad to happen, they're just not smart enough to listen to the warnings.  I mentioned before that I have an uncle who compared the attitude to those people who were on the Titanic and didn't get in the lifeboats because they didn't believe the ship was going to sink.  I tried to read up about it and found that it's called \"normalcy bias,\" a kind of thinking error that causes people to minimize warnings of actual danger.\n\nThink about all the people who didn't vote in 2000, or 2004, or 2016, and if you had said that Roe v. Wade could be overturned, they would say \"Roe v. Wade has been the law for 50 years, of course it's not going away.\"  It's not that they hated women and wanted it overturned, they just didn't believe it was going to happen.  Roe v. Wade had become normal, and so they assumed it would always continue.  I've been reading stuff online about Trump, with people saying, \"Oh, he's not going to do all that awful stuff, be a dictator, he was just joking.\"  They don't want a dictator, they're just not able to get past their normalcy bias and see that he does mean what he says.\n\nNow that I learned about that, I plan to keep it in my back pocket for the next time a \"men are more logical\" discussion gets started.  Men supporting Trump are proving that they are not objective or logical, they are thinking with emotions instead of reason, and when they dismiss warnings about how terrible he is they are proving that they lack the brainpower to get past their own normalcy bias.",

Women were and still are very sacred beings. The bridge for new life from the spirit realm into our physical realm. Emotions are a blessing when we learn how to be true to ourselves and not let them over take us, which women are blessed to learn and master a lot sooner than men. Maternal instinct is a force mother nature herself would steer clear of. It is the women who led in important decisions involving everyone's well being. It is the Women who decided almost everything and were sought out with high, sacred regard.\n\nI am in Canada and have chosen to be ignorant to the United States for the most part along with the politics here as well. I just started in university and am only now starting to learn politics at age 34. My heart has always been heavy with the news I hear from things that happen in the states. We really aren't much better up here when it comes to many things, especially the misogyny and racism. Seems to be colonial trademarks along with genocide. My room mates daughter is 12 and identifies and non binary. The amount of tears I've heard and seen come from that strong, beautiful, innocent heart in regards to bullying from school. It is normal and kids being kids but to have to switch schools because the staff also started to partake in it or would turn a blind eye thus condoning such behavior? The amount of disgusting sht the kids learn at home then bring into school projecting their parents meaningless, pitiful, shallow understandings onto others? Is growing exponentially since I was in grade school for some reason up here too.\n\nI don't think we will ever see something with balance in it when it comes to us all as a race, humanity in a global society. Not as long as us in Western society and this world in general thrives off the over consumption of our planet that mothers us all. Colonizers, greed ran pitiful excuses of human beings and colonizing sympathizers can't respect her, why would they respect any other female?\n\nI'm sorry life has been so difficult for you as a woman OP, truly I am. It most likely won't get any easier either. But we aren't here for an easy life. We are here to make our children's and our grandchildrens lives easier and so on and so forth. \n\nLife in Canada has not been easy as an Indigenous young man who was born to a single mother who was once both a residential school and 60s scoop survivor. In fact, it is only getting harder now that I'm trying to get myself university level educated. The things being taught about our history here in university is a whitewashed version of events. Which I got first hand stories of... add in I have children I'm alienated from and recently overcame addictions and homelessness too. Sh*t doesn't get easier, our shoulders just get stronger.

         "Here\u2019s my honest take on what wrong for Democrats.\n\nTo add context, I\u2019m a guy who did vote for Kamala.\n\nFirst off, the Democratic Party essentially bullied Biden out of the race. Either he shouldn\u2019t have sought out a 2nd term from the beginning, this way it goes the primaries system to decide the next Democratic candidate, or they should\u2019ve just stuck with Biden. Hard to say what the outcome would\u2019ve been though because that\u2019s a what if at this point. Who knows, maybe Biden should\u2019ve stepped down as President too, this way it would\u2019ve gave Kamala a chance as President for voters to better gauge.\n\nSome have said the country doesn\u2019t want a female president. I would disagree with that by using the 2016 popular vote as reference, Hillary Clinton beat him on that.\n\nSecondly, the party did imho pick the worst possible replacement. Even in 2020, through the primaries, some have done much better than her. Honestly, she wasn\u2019t even on my list of people to replace Biden.\n\nThird, she didn\u2019t differentiate herself enough.\n\nI\u2019ll probably edit this to add more. I\u2019m half awake and a bit upset right now.",
         "The US is a racist and sexist place. \n\nPeople were not motivated enough, both candidates are going to underperform in vote totals compared to 2020. \n\nAlso trump suspiciously said that he didn\u2019t need people to go out and vote.",

         "I\u2019m in a VERY blue area with very blue family and am nauseous as all get out. I\u2019ve been working from home this week and have gotten absolutely nothing done. I\u2019m alternating between obsessively checking poll results and watching Disney movies. \n\nI\u2019m hoping if things go poorly that my state will secede and join Canada.",

         "I feel nauseous with terror.",
         "I'm fucking terrified. I'm sitting here watching the election map with sweaty palms and a sick feeling in my gut. To most men, this election is about the possibility of a tax cut. For me, a woman who doesn't want children, it's literally about my fucking life.",
         "I feel physically sick.",
         "This is none of my business as a man from the UK but what I'm seeing so far is absolutely mind boggling. The fact that millions of people have willingly voted for a narcissistic, rapist felon to lead their country just fills me with so much dread at the state of the world, and just human nature in general.\n\nMaybe its the sleep deprivation from my son currently keeping me up until 1:30am, but I'm fairly certain we're all doomed.",

         "There are plenty of signs that polls have been skewed due to conservative polsters only targeting conservative demographics this cycle. Turnout and early voting are also very high, which suggests more women and young people voting. Don\u2019t give up hope yet.",
         "I had just calmed my nerves, telling myself that if he somehow won, he'd never be able to run again, because he already served a term & is already suffering cognitive decline & wearing adult diapers.\n\n  \n& then someone ruined it by pointing out that Trump would surely get one of his rancid sons to run in his place in 4 years.",
         "We live in a very racist and sexist nation. But.  It's not everyone. No matter what happens you're not alone. We're in this together, and all we can do is work together to get all of us through it as safely as we can.",

         "This election being so close is so sad. Literally show me how much America hates women. I want to move now.",
         "As a non-American who has family and friends in the country, the preliminary results are horrifying. How the hell can people vote for an actual felon rapist who can't string together coherent sentences? How the hell is he *leading*?\n\nThis election has ripples around the world and the last thing I want is for the far-right in other countries to be emboldened by the results.",
         "You should be. We all should be scared. Every single woman, even the white, wealthy women should be scared. If that motherfucker wins, shit is going to get real and get real fast.",

         "Seeing the current vote has me so nervous, I know so far most of the votes counted have come from red states, but I feel extremely hopeless. In 2016 when I was watching the polls I was so hopeful, I really thought there was no way he would be president, I won't make the mistake of getting my hopes up again.",
         "Thank you for opening the space for this. I'm terrified too. \n\nI'm multi-marginalized when it comes to demographics... this is life or death for me and people I share love with. The communities I move in don't need to be convinced on how to vote but I so so so appreciate the people who had sit downs with their families to change hearts and minds.\n\nIt's not an easy thing to do. Your work saves lives.\n\nI voted and turned off all notifications on my phone. I'm about to settle down with a good book and a high dose edible to check out until tomorrow morning because I'm so overwhelmed.\n\nI hope we all have what we need tonight to move through this no matter what tomorrow brings.",
         "I, in my desperate attempt to find the ground, would just like to say:\n\nAll of this is shit. This is a very well architected plan. This is centuries of misogyny, embedded in religion and society and government. Decades of planning to stack a court and capitalize on fear, hate, and ignorance. \n\nWe cannot stop fighting. \n\nIf anything can come out of this, we must carry on. We gotta stick together. Lots of people have had their eyes open this go round. I've heard a lot of stories of lifelong \"Rs\" finally listening and standing up for human decency. Let's keep talking. Teach people how to be better allies. STOP TOLERATING MISOGYNISTIC BULLSHIT, and help our fellow folks in bad situations find support and a way out. This fight is worth it. Demand better at every turn and support your fellow human in their quest to demand it as well. \n\nNo matter what tomorrow brings, it is still our fight. We are always stronger together. \n\nImma go cry now.\n\nEdit: autocorrect didn't want to let me swear.",
         "It's over. We lost. I'm so sick. This is worse than 2016. The fucking meme Twitter piece of shit won the presidency again after an insurrection.\n\nThis country is beyond repair.",
         "Yeah this isn't looking good so far - this is the only place I have admitted it. My husband is watching a show downstairs and I thought I was going to not pay attention until later but I am and it's way too close. Almost every county in Georgia is redder than 2020. Virginia will likely be blue but just barely. North Carolina is likely going Red. It's still certainly possible Harris wins Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin - that's all she needs. But why is *every county* so far redder than last election.\n\nI don't mean to alarm anyone - just - WTF. I thought I was prepared for this - but I am not.",
         "Anyone decided to get BC Incase of another Trump presidency? I\u2019m literally calling my OBGYN tomorrow morning. I\u2019m so fucking scared I live in Utah as well it will not be great for me \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d",

         "This male is scared also. I voted for my wife and future children. Blue down the line and used to be a registered Republican. But to get your hopes up seems like a huge turnout from women. This bodes well for Harris.",
         "It's not looking good. I'm in a red state in a red county. Fuck my rights and the rights of those I love, eh?",
         "I'm holding my breath in Australia watching the election numbers roll in. I really really hope this is just the red mirage.",
         "I'm also genuinely scared and full of anxiety and have no one in my family I can talk to about this. Mom, boyfriend, best friend. I'm the only one who voted blue. I'm struggling to make peace with their choices, some of which include willful ignorance. Really struggling.",
         "I am beyond terrified right now. And I had my tubes removed after Dobbs so from a very privileged perspective, I\u2019ll be fine. But I am so scared for all the younger versions of me who still have so much growing up to do and who deserve the rights I had.",

         "It's 2am here in Michigan and I'm sobbing. I have work in six hours and I don't know how to face anyone. I'm so broken. I was hopeful and my spirit is crushed what feels like beyond repair.\n\n I don't know how I will look my father (a devoted Trump supporter) in the eye anymore. It was already bad but this election had me reenergized and hopeful that the country would learn from the bullshit and grow.\n\nMy SO is sleeping as he has an earlier day than me but he's hurt too. 2016 was bad, but this feels so much worse.",

         "Bruh I'm Canadian and I talked to a female friend of mine in the US. I discussed politics with her and she told me she was a centrist but voted for Trump cuz she said that the democrats had a secret agenda! She was against abortion and I told her about how that texan girl died, who couldn't get an abortion to save her life and she wouldn't believe me.. y'all are cooked.",

         "As a Canadian its like watching a show that you fully expect the classic 'hero' to win only now weve hit a point where we cant tell if the writers decided to put in a terrible plot twist with the irredeemable nazi rapist somehow wins just to make their own 'unique' story.\n\nSomehow its both incredibly stressful and surprisingly disappointing to see how red the map still is, even if it is just a 'red mirage'. Over 50 million have voted for the nazi rapist.",

         "I'm so scared. If Trump wins, women being equal to men has always been our country play acting to placate us. I have a daughter. I will fight for her equality if I can't have mine.",

         "Don't look at the news till 9 . It's just not worth it. You won't going to find anything worth the stress.",
         "Just remember the red mirage...it will look like Cheetolini is winning early on, but that's bc he was always gonna win the small counties where voting is done quickly. It's only temporary.",

         "So am I.\n\nBut whatever comes next, we're going to get through it. Our grandmothers and mothers and all the wonen who came before them fought through it and made a better future for all of us. If anyone tries to destroy it, we will build it back up stronger and brighter and taller than ever, for ourselves and our daughters and all the women after them.\n\nHistory is filled with the oppression of women but it is also filled with our strength, courage, intelligence, compassion, and integrity and our will to fight. As long as we have have these things, no one can destroy us. \n\nNot then. Not now. Not ever.",
         "I just feel nauseous.   I was prepared for the worst but seeing it in real time is giving me a migraine.   I have to be up early and I have no idea how I'm going to get any sleep. I keep refreshing the map and it just gets worse every time.",
         "Same. And I am so frustrated that people might waste their vote bc they think all politicians are the same, bc they want to oppose genocide, that nothing bad will happen if he wins. Sorry that we don't have a super amazing candidate to choose, but one has followers that are truly hateful and oppressive. It's insane to me that we didn't leave this behind four years ago.",

It's more about maintaining focus.\n\nI dread the morning when the maggots come in. They have no middle ground and will behave in massive extremes either way with aggression in times of both joy and pain. No call outs, just coming in whooping and hollering.",

We stand, we prevail, but like WW2, civil rights, Vietnam, and too much more, incalculable pain and loss could have been avoided if we\u2019d only stood sooner.",

I can't bring myself to watch the news the way a kid in a horror movie can't bring themselves to turn their head and see the ghost lurking in the corner of the room.\n\nI hope it helps to know you're not alone in this. Solidarity is all I have to offer as I'm out of good advice. My plan for tonight is to drink until I feel like I can breathe again.",
         "Making sure Trump doesn't get another chance to fuck shit up is important, but even if he should drop off the face of the planet tomorrow (and as of right now, we can hope), the march towards a fascist theocracy will continue. Trump did not start that, and is not required for it to proceed. \n\nAmong other damage, Trump cemented the hold of the [Christian Taliban](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1f7r443/what_is_the_biggest_threat_facing_america/ll9dedw/) on the Supreme Court (not to mention many federal courts), and THEY'RE the ones who will eventually foist the Republic of Gilead on us.

I think we are saved for a little while. But these cultists will not stop. \n\nIf they get what they want, even they won't like it. It's a net loss for every US citizen so the fear is real. It's also real for good people who have emigrated here. They can't be sent back. It's just awful.\n\nI have no data, but I believe Kamala and Walz will win.

This poses as a major vulnerability, particularly for those at risk of criminalization for seeking an abortion.\n\nBefore *Roe v Wade* was even overturned, Dr. Randall Williams, former Missouri state health director, tracked the menstrual cycles of women who visited Planned Parenthood, which was used to identify individuals who might have had abortions following failed termination procedures. To clarify, this doctor holds anti-abortion views.\n\nSource: [*Should you worry about data from your period-tracking app being used against you?*](https://www.politifact.com/article/2022/may/12/ask-khn-politifact-should-you-worry-about-data-you/)\n\nThe former director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, Scott Lloyd, took a disturbing approach by tracking menstrual cycles for potential criminal prosecutions and, in at least one instance, for experimentation:\n\n>Lloyd has\u00a0admitted\u00a0to pressuring these young women to keep their pregnancies. Seemingly, he was quite strenuous in his insistence. In one email, Lloyd relates that a pregnant woman in his care who was seeking\u2014and being kept from having\u2014an abortion mentioned suicide. In response to that,\u00a0he writes: \u201cThe clinician describes her demeanor as 'obnoxious' and that 'the unborn child is in our care so the medical team should continue with standard prenatal care.'\" If she continued to want an abortion after \u201cspiritual counseling,\u201d Lloyd continues, she\u2019d have to obtain parental consent.\n\nSource: [*The U.S. Is Tracking Migrant Girls' Periods to Stop Them From Getting Abortions*](https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/politics/a26985261/trump-administration-abortion-period-tracking-migrant-women/)\n\nExperts are concerned. Hell, doctors and nurses are outright refusing to perform procedures due to the fear of criminal charges and the potential revocation of their medical licenses. **Women have every reason to be worried**, and your casual attitude toward this issue is not only dismissive but potentially harmful.\n\nSome good news: In states like California, Colorado, Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Montana, New Hampshire, and Virginia, their user information is protected to varying degrees, with some allowing the user to determine if their data is sold to third parties or not.\n\nYou do raise an important point that needs more attention: Privacy protection goes beyond just period tracker apps. Avoid discussing topics like your menstrual cycle, pregnancy, or general women\u2019s health on devices like computers or phones. Reproductive health data can be stored across all digital platforms.

         "There may be more, but I know of 4, based on [this source](https://khalielawright.com/patron-saints-of-abortion/)\n\n[Brigid of Kildare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigid_of_Kildare)\n\n>\"A certain woman who had taken the vow of chastity fell, through the youthful desire of pleasure, and her womb swelled with child. Brigid, exercising the most potent strength of her ineffable faith, blessed her, causing the child to disappear, without coming to birth, and without pain. She faithfully returned the woman to health and to penance\"\n\n[Ciar\u00e1n of Saigir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciar%C3%A1n_of_Saigir#cite_note-15)\n\n>He is reputed in the Lives as having miraculously performed abortion in a raped nun called Bruinnech.\n\nThe wikipedia page also has a response from a more modern Catholic on this, which amusingly is basically \"yo we just make all this Saint stuff up it doesn't mean anything\".\n\n[\u00c1ed mac Bricc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%81ed_mac_Bricc)\n\n>On one occasion, when he perceived that the girl serving him was pregnant he fled from the building both to avoid the pollution and to shame her. She confessed her sins and did penance. \u00c1ed was not one to leave someone under his care in a difficult situation; he blessed her womb and the baby disappeared as if it had never been there.\n\nSo this Saint will emotionally abuse you a bit first, but then he will provide miracle healthcare.\n\n[Cainnech of Aghoboe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cainnech_of_Aghaboe) His wikipedia page doesn't mention his holy abortion, but the first source has this story.\n\n>A certain nun living in Cainnech of Aghaboe\u2019s neighborhood secretly committed fornication. In time, her womb began to grow with the child conceived. She asked Saint Cainnech to bless her belly, pretending that it was swollen by some ailment or pain. When he blessed her, the infant in her womb vanished, not appearing.\n\nNote that every one of these Saints is Irish, and if you google it's these four Saints that you will find, in many different places. I'm not sure if that's because these really are the only four Saints that performed documented abortions, or because these were popularized by some expert of Irish history or something, but there are others out there that aren't as well known. It's also possible that they just have more of a widespread and popular mythology about them, that the Catholic church can't scrub out as much. Like the previous poster said, the Bible literally has instructions on how to perform an abortion, so I really doubt that only these four Saints in one time period and part of the world were celebrated for this, compared to some quirk of history and religion making it so that their legend was the one that wasn't overwritten.",

         "I always say that my religious beliefs were chosen for me by a Christian at birth. I was born in bosnia shortly before the ethnic cleansing over there started. Technically my family was Muslim. But the orthodox Christian man that signed my birth certificate refused to put that on it when I was Muslim so he put down none. That's right. I ended up with a birth certificate that says none on the religious section. I don't know what his motivation was for that. But in any case ever since I was a kid I always had an interest in religion like I had an interest for lore of anything. I find the religion intriguing in its own right even if I don't believe in any of it. I have always believed in God though. Although I always have seen God in a way that no one else that I have met has. I see God as a floating ball of infinite energy. And that that energy is what flows though all of us. When I was a kid I surmised that this is what gave us all consciousness. I also surmised that God gives little to no shits about how you worship them. Them because little me refused to put a gender on God as well. I decided to worship God though appreciating nature and art. And treating people well.",

I'm concerned that economically aspirational Latin men (predominantly) and women to a lesser extent may be taken in by some of his rhetoric and may brush off the racism. I wouldn't be surprised if some younger black men were taken in for the same reason. I just feel so frustrated that people are being taken in by his non-existent economic plans at the cost of being seen as basically subhuman. That's insanely depressing, though I suppose not necessarily a new thing. His rhetoric has been so fucking nasty, though.\n\nI don't know if white women are finally coming to their senses, but preliminary reporting I've seen on this didn't reflect that to the extent that some sources reflected prior to now.

The Patriot act still exists, the ACA will be fought over, as well as Medicare and Medicaid, Social Security is always on the line.

I vote both in the US and in Australia and you see the same utter grifting to various degrees when it comes to men like this who are economically out of touch and uninformed, but have so much to say about how great they'll be for everyone. People inexplicably lap it up\n\nYeah, I totally agree. It's such a crazy time in terms of voting implications. The other thing's just the rage one feels when a vote for Trump \"on economic grounds\" implicates voters in his mass deportation plan - something that is not only obviously inhumane and convoluted, but which is obviously far from free-of-cost to arrange and would cut, what, 10 million extremely essential workers from the US job market?

I think it would take immeasurable suffering to fully sway public demand enough to mobilize formidable, policy-reversing blowback against Trumpism in four years.\n\nI can't think of any likely scenario whatsoever worth rooting for.  I hope there is still a decent future as soon as 10 or maybe 20 years from now, but I have no concept whatsoever what it could look like or how we would get there, just a vague sense that it might happen if civilization doesn't collapse due to climate/energy/oligarchs, but it might be decades.  The Berlin Wall fell in 1990, so if the 30s happen here, we might be on a really long road back to normalcy, but I hope the optimistic 10-20 years is at least somewhat attainable.\n\nEven if we continue to have elections after this one, the court guarantees that gains are temporary, marginal, and perceived as useless to swing voters, while losses are massive and permanent.  Swing voters will continue to think it can't be changed anyway - which is like voting to put more gas on a fire because water doesn't work anyway, but they're the only voters who matter.\n\nNothing literally lasts forever, but eventual positive change is a horizon I am unable to see from here.  We have a two-year-old, and I don't have forever to figure out what I'll say when he's old enough to ask questions about the world and the future.  Maybe I can answer for the level of a six-year-old in 2028, but it only gets way harder the 4-8 years following, and if our world wants to stay horrible with no signs of improvement, he will be old enough to grasp that.\n\nThis is some pretty deep bargaining-stage depression regarding the entire scale of our remaining lifetimes, but we've all been processing non-stop since 2016.

But Modi\u2019s win and popularity in India is not surprising to me.\n\nThe US on the other hand - I truly believed that the US was a more liberal country and egalitarian society, the electoral college, poor messaging by democrats, etc were to blame.

My ex hasn\u2019t been involved in my son\u2019s life which was perfect for me. 5 years later I\u2019m married, we have a happy, stable, wonderful life that my child also belongs to. Recently I did ancestral DNA testing because I was curious.\n\nWell, my son isn\u2019t related to my ex or anyone in his family. Instead my son shares a genetic history with someone who is like a father to me and a grandpa to my child. I only found out 3 days ago, and it is like no one can comprehend that means I was fucking sexually assaulted by someone I trusted tremendously. I cannot even stomach the idea of speaking to him right now, and I didn\u2019t want to hear lies from him. It makes some level of sense because he\u2019s always had a deep care and spoiling type of relationship with my kid, where he does almost nothing for his own grandchildren.\n\nOne of my closest friends was even flippant, and was like, The good news is you\u2019ll be loaded! I have had similar reactions from everyone else. The REALITY is that I feel deeply betrayed and sad. It is quickly spiraling into this sense of grief, anger, and some sort of lost feeling.\n\nI don\u2019t have the luxury of just pretending it didn\u2019t happen because now I have the burden of knowing it did.

I wanted to know what ancestral background he has so I could share it when he wants it, and raise him strong in the truth and not lies like I was raised with. The rapist had a huge opinion that it was useless and it wouldn\u2019t matter to my son, and that I shouldn\u2019t test him. Which in hindsight means he knew or at least suspected my son is his, which means he knows he raped me. For years he has just lied to me and manipulated me.",

They may say it's best to just pursue family court and paternity, or they may suggest you go to civil court first, or the police. \n\nCivil court has a lower standard of evidence, while criminal court requires \"no shadow of a doubt\".

Another option is to threaten going to the authorities to get him to sign away his parental rights. The fact that he hasn\u2019t come forward despite how he feels for your child just means he\u2019s afraid that someone will find out. It\u2019s a terrible situation to be in.

It was the holidays and I was very distressed because of other life stuff, and I know I over drank and took Xanax, likely blacking out. It\u2019s all the years of comments about how much my son looks like him as a little boy, sideways comments that led to directly ask if anything had ever happened. He fucking lied for YEARS, and I believed him because I trusted that he loved and respected me enough that he would never do anything like that.",
         "Not after that much time has passed, sadly. They will claim it was consentual and win because OP will be painted as someone who now wants (higher) child payments etc.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0There is no way for OP to prove anything but her word and sadly that's never good enough in court.\n\nedit: Even worse, if she confronts him with the genetic tests, she could be forced to give him parenting time. It is much better to go no contact with him and for the sake of fairness, get the ex to sign away his parental rights, so you can't be accused of disfrauding them.",
         "This guy sounds plain EVIL. To take advantage of someone that trusted you like that, that\u2019s just vile. I am sorry this happened to you.",
         "Please know this: people reacting like you describe, being flippant, are absolutely completely wrong. Your feelings - grief, anger, and loss - are entirely appropriate.\n\n\nAll of us here reading this would love to see this creep go to prison. But probably best to talk to a lawyer first to find out how it works, and whether it's in your best interest or not.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd before any of that, get counselling or some serious mental health support, because this is very very serious stuff that no one should go through alone",
         "OP, I am so so sorry this happened. And I hope you know that you are reacting right and valid and I have no clue what is wrong with the people in your life downplaying this. Well actually I do, but lemme not even start on how much that angers me.\n\nIn this moment where you are feeling violated and deceived and manipulated and lied to, I want to remind you of one thing that may or may not help but I think you should know:\n\nRight now, you hold all the cards. How that man spends his twilight years is up to you. Whether he gets to spend them in a cushy retirement home or a jail cell is up to you. Even if you decide not to press charges you have enough evidence to lean on him for him to step up and provide for your son. Not in gifts, not spoiling, but in real tangible and it sounds potentially life-changing ways. I am not saying to blackmail him (but I absolutely wouldn\u2019t judge if you did..) but that you now get to decide how this horrific story gets to conclude. You get to decide what punishment he should face. \n\nIn a moment, where he has completely robbed you of your agency, bodily autonomy, and power, he has somehow now also given you enough evidence to gain some of that power back. You don\u2019t have to use it, but please remember, especially in the moments you feel weak and betrayed, that it is there.",
         "I'm sorry you're going through this. You should read into the story of [Gisele Pelicot](https://time.com/7132718/gisele-pelicot-dominique-rape-trial-marriage/). A real case that's drawing a lot of attention in France right now. Basically, a husband drugged his wife and pimped out her unconscious body to strangers for years. She believed they were happily married & thought she had Alzheimer's because she was forgetting so much. Police found a folder of evidence in her husband's computer of men raping her. It's a horrible story, but Gisele has been iconic in how she handled it. Just saw some parallels with your story. Wish you the best",
         "I don\u2019t know if he drugged me or not. My guess is no. That holiday season was very rough and I was in a fairly bad emotional state. I know I would have drank alcohol, and I had an Rx for Xanax\u2026 so I could have caused my own self to pass out, which I knew was a risk because it had happened before. But I felt safe, and frequently stayed at his house when I went to the city, and he even kept a bedroom for me. I stayed because I trusted him 100%. I\u2019m absolutely certain that under no conditions would I have ever voluntarily slept with him because the idea is diagusting and he\u2019s more of a parent to me than my own parents.",
         "Before you do any of this, talk to an attorney. You would NOT want this man to in any way convince a judge that he has rights pertaining to your son.",
         "I\u2019d be worried he\u2019d try to take partial custody of the child!",
         "I asked him directly to do it after seeing the ancestry and he went into how he\u2019d remember if we ever had sex, blah blah lies. He dismissed my request for a lab DNA paternity test. I feel like I should feel more sane before I think of forcing the issue.",
         "This. I wouldn't put too much faith in those ancestral DNA tests. Some of them are basically garbage science",
         "No most people in my greater family are accounted for by DNA, and the rapist is not related to me or my ex, only my son. I did my sons for the heck of it, wanting to know his percentage on A and B, between my ex and I.",
         "Do I have to file something in court to force a paternity test at a lab if he won\u2019t voluntarily do it?",
         "That Christmas was an awful time in my life, as someone very close to me had passed, I worked and lived 2 hours away from all my friends, I hated my job, and I had a medical procedure at the start of the month. Over the holiday I drank A LOT, and if I drank a lot and took the Xanax, it did have the ability to just make me pass out. I know that for sure because it had happened before. I stupidly felt safe, not life I was at risk in anyway. I don\u2019t remember anything happening ever, but the DNA match came back at parental levels so my best guess is the above.",
         "I guess because I don\u2019t remember anything like that ever happening, and I know I would have been completely wasted\u2026 I cannot 100% account for myself. That said, I have sincerely asked him and he\u2019s denied it every time, yet kept the behavior of being way overly interested in my son and often comparing himself to my son. My best guess is that I passed the heck out, but having no memory of anything makes me feel extra confused and violated like my own mind is failing me.",
         "That would be highly, highly unlikely. The chances that her kid got some random person\u2019s results AND that they matched with the rapist\u2019s family would be astronomical. I\u2019m also assuming her child matches with his maternal (the OP\u2019s) family.",
         "That is absolutely horrific. I am so sorry. This must feel like being assaulted *now*. Please, get some counseling, and take care of your mental health. We're all on your side.  /hugs",
         "His current state of mild dementia may not interfere with legal procedures. Unless you're going to inherit a lot of money from him, it may be worth consulting a lawyer to understand legal processes you may need to be involved in and then filing a report with police. You may also be able to file a civil suit.\n\nI'm sorry this happened to you. There's hardly anything that can be more traumatizing and disturbing than this. May he suffer greatly and rot.",
         "He didn't have dementia 5 years ago... Press those charges",
         "While he might be able to get off, this is quite important information for hospitals, aged care facilities etc to know about.\n\nThis man should not be allowed in mixed wards and mixed dementia units.\n\nEven men with dementia are capable to raping other women in care.",
         "I undernstand you and I feel you. He deserves jail and the dementia thing is also deserved and is some kind of jail, he will not be free again in his mind.\n\n\nWish you all the best.",
         "When your emotions start picking on you, I hope you\u2019ll remind yourself that nothing you can think of would make you responsible for this. It was his decision and his alone. you did not have a say in it. I\u2019m so, so sorry that you\u2019re going through this OP. My heart just breaks for you",
         "If anyone ever tells you it\u2019s your fault, they are mental.",
         "So you\u2019ve already asked him if anything happened?",
         "Do not assume he will get off-Please press charges or at least do free consults with multiple attorneys. You have ~20y window, at least in my state. I\u2019m very sorry.",
         "I don\u2019t have any advice. Others here have been helping with that. I just wanted to say I\u2019m so sorry this happened to you. What a disgusting misuse of your trust. It\u2019s not your fault.",
         "Would Xanax cause you to not wake up or lose memory? I only ask because I have a Xanax script and I would definitely still at least half wake up if someone was moving or touching me. \n\nEither way, you couldn't have consented.  \n\nI would consult a lawyer and go from there.",
         "I know that\u2019s good advice. Thank you \u2764\ufe0f",
         "Thankfully, he was recently diagnosed with mild dementia, and I now live states away. There\u2019s no way a court would find him fit, I\u2019d guess.",
         "Technical question: is he already in the Ancestry DNA database and matched with your son? If so, what % did he match at?",
         "It's 100% a match for paternity. They're sometimes wrong about ethnicity, NOT parental relationship.",
         "Maybe the bs statistics, but matching DNA nearly 50% to this guy is no denying that\u2019s a parent.",
         "I feel horrible for saying this but please make sure there is not any possibility where he could be your father instead! At the end, do what feels right for you. The man deserve to rot in hell. I'm so sorry!",
         "you could give him an option of using a home test if you feel safe enough to ask but yes, judicially is the way to go. edit, contact your DSS child support office for the first step. good luck!",
         "Yes, my son matches with me and my family.",
         "The physical part makes me disgusted to consider, but right now I feel most violated by the fact he would do this because I trusted him entirely.",
         "Yes, there is a lot of money in his estate. He owned a large commercial construction for many years and invested well. How do his finances change this?",
         "For years I asked him because he kept doing weird stuff like sending me photo collages of him at my son\u2019s age. Undoubtably they looked alike. Then he pushed me to get my son\u2019s blood type done in case my son was ever in an accident. I\u2019m O+, he\u2019s AB-, my son is B-, and I have no idea about my ex, but figured it was just weird, not that he raped me. Overall he was just more interested and invested in my son than he ever has been with his own family. But it figured it was because I\u2019m like a daughter to him, and he just loves my son so much.",
         "Talk to a lawyer- whether or not he\u2019s competent to be punished may not preclude his being liable to pay support.",
         "I'm sorry for what he did to you.\n\nBut  I am not with the other people here saying you should go hard and press charges and blow everything to pieces. You need to weigh your options here and what is in the best interest of yourself and your son.\n\nSee a lawyer, get a professional opinion of what is likely to happen. A civil suit might be your best course of action for any kind of justice and repeerations.",
         "The Christmas at issue is the one where he bought DNA Ancestry tests. So he, my ex, and I all have profiles, and so do a bunch of my family members. His DNA wasn\u2019t as high as mine to my son, I think 47.something %. I know these tests are not the same as a lab test, and I would need a lab paternity. But this is all is stacking out to look really bad. Years ago he wanted me to have my son\u2019s blood type done in case he was ever in an accident, I\u2019m O+, he\u2019s AB-, no idea about my ex, but my son is B-.",
         "You need someone to talk this over with, though, especially since you\u2019re not getting emotional support from those around you.",
         "It's up to you if it changes anything. It's just that if you report him you will likely be removed from his will. So you have to make a personal choice on if you want to watch him slowly rot of dementia and collect the inheritance. Or if you want to get retribution through law. It doesn't change how awful he is. It's just about which path will give you the most peace. Which only you can decide.",
         "You want an attorney. Let them help you navigate this. Therapy probably better sooner than later as well. So sorry you are going through this.",
         "So his kid should be entitled to inheritance. Another reason report.",
         "I\u2019m so sorry dear. I think that any correspondence with him like a confrontation or questioning should be recorded or written in email or texts. Get him to admit it. I would also consult with a lawyer.",
         "That makes sense. I would guess that in order to keep his name clean he\u2019d willingly pay anyway.",
         "That's definitely in the parental range percentage. We inherit roughly 50% of our DNA from each parent.",
         "He knew what he did and felt no remorse about it. Him buying this gift should be included in court testimony.",
         "Would his kid be entitled to anything though?",
         "On the other hand, you may not be in his will anyway. Sounds like a close friend of the family - \"Like a father\".",

They already want to roll back the legal systems that force organisations to at least pretend to be inclusive. They're going to try and force women into marriage to survive.\n\nIf I was an American woman, I would be trying to leave the country. Fuck, illegally cross some borders. Escape, somehow, somewhere. \n\nEven here in Australia I'm afraid of the results of the US election. We've already had conservatives try and nearly succeed at banning abortion in 2 states (of which we only have 6 + 2 territories) in the last few weeks.",
         "This won\u2019t work. You\u2019re talking to American women\u2026Did it work LAST TIME? When the abortion ban first happened? American women are incapable of separating themselves from men. Now\u2026Korean and Chinese women, there 6B movement is amazing.",
         "Yeah. Can't be risking pregnancies when doctors will let you die if something goes wrong. I guess I'm dying a virgin.",
         "Seriously, the best thing women can do is stop having relationships with men and give them kids. Start working on leaving the country if you can. This shit isn't going away.",

         "Just like the underground Korean movement - 4b, where it's  not marrying a man, no sex with man, no dating and no kids.",
         "What we need to do is push for a law that requires all unmarried citizens that have vas deferens and are \"of breeding age\" to have a temporary vasectomy done. When they get married they can have it reversed and try to have kids. Then we would only need abortions when something goes wrong with the pregnancy. Problem solved. It would drastically reduce our need for birth control, too. Two birds, one stone. \n\nExtremist policies are all the rage right now, right? So this idea should be right up their alley, there's no logical reason for them to object. Of course, there's no such thing as a \"temporary vasectomy\" right now. But they can make do with the real deal until we figure that out, it is still (sort of) reversible.",
         "Love the idea - I decided I was done with men ever since my last ex-bf honestly. I am like a feminist separatist at this point. I can't actually get rid of men from my life entirely, but I'll do so as far as I can while not exiting society. I'm absolutely not going to be friends with any; I am cutting off my dad even and only gonna maintain a relationship with my mom; I also don't tip any men in service work either honestly. I'm only dating, supporting, befriending, and tipping women from here on out. Well, unless it's obvious she's a Karen, pick-me, or tradwife. Then nah.

         "Withholding sex as a protest against women\u2019s rights restrictions falls flat because it hits the wrong targets. The lawmakers clamping down on rights aren\u2019t the ones who feel the effects of personal relationship dynamics, so this tactic just strains individual partnerships, often between people who already support women\u2019s rights. Plus, it leans on tired stereotypes, casting women as the gatekeepers of sex, which undercuts the whole point of autonomy and equality. Instead of moving the needle on policy, it risks coming off as manipulative or regressive, which opponents will jump on as fuel for their own agendas. Effective change needs to be directed where it counts\u2014in voting booths, advocacy, and public protests, not in the bedroom, where it might alienate allies more than it pressures the real culprits",

Medicare/medicade/social security are 100% gone within our lifetimes if not within 10 years. The chevron ruling already said its ok for companies to pollute and kill people, they have absolutely nothing stopping them now. Conservatives have been -very- clear that their key priority is to \"fix\" voting should they win again (of course to non conservatives that means dictatorship). They probably won't even wait for SCOTUS to come down with a ruling about gay marriage, birth control, access to abortion or just women's healthcare in general. \n\nThe only thing left to wonder is how far they intend to go into the handmaid's tale.

For example - something like Trump should have never even been a candidate at all, regardless of who is willing to vote for him). \n\nhttps://redsails.org/the-pitfalls-of-liberalism/ (to understand why neoliberals are historically and systemically complicit in that violence).\n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1884/origin-family/\n(Works of Frederick Engels 1884, The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State, to understand how patriarchy, birth, capitalism and abortions are connected). \n\nBasically, the institution of patriarchal family required, as its foundation, the dominance of the man over the woman and the confinement of all property relations within the family / to secure property inheritance within male lineage. As a result, women were confined to roles of childbearing and household labor, making them \"means of production and reproduction\" to sustain family wealth. This structure arose from the value placed on private property and inheritance, creating social control over women\u2019s labor and reproduction. Capitalism later built on this setup, relying on women\u2019s unpaid domestic labor to maintain a steady workforce, reinforcing male dominance and the exploitation of women to sustain the economic system.\n\nIn addition:\n\n1) Read leftist theory. Political education IS important to truly grasp what is happening in your society & why and why it obviously affects you and your rights and so on. \n\n2) Join leftist orgs, in particular marxist feminist orgs in your community, if you have none, start forming them! Endless of women who could never rely on the US settler state and its laws  to protect them or aid them, had to rely through history on mutual aid, being part of a community that shows up for eachother and so on. (That includes underground movements). \n(Note: I wanted to make a radical marxist feminist platform on discord, meaning anti western imperial, capitalist and choice feminist nonsense, that does not center straight cis men - if anyone is interested, hit me up via PM). \n\n3) Organized protests. No, not holding signs and bs - organized worker protests with demands. You will have to connect across your country, decide on the demands you have and walk out. Walk out of your jobs, your roles as mothers, grandmothers, workers. You all have been the shit pacified while not acknowledging that your BIGGEST weapon is the fact that you make half of your society and if you refuse to do labor for a certain period of time - your society is gonna shake. They rely on your free labor, your physical labor, all of it. \n\n4) Divest from men, build and nurture solidarity and community with other women. Think \"xyz dude is cute\", does he give a fuck about your rights? Does he give a fuck about systemic oppression, history and so on? No? Move on. Stop putting your energy into relationships with men who do not even care for your basic human rights. \n\n5) Divest from sex in any form that can get you pregnant. There are endless of other ways to get off. Maybe that will motivate some of the men in your life to actually give a fck? Probably not hmm. Eitherway, less chances to get pregnant. \n\n6) If that is not a sacrifice you want to bring for more safety and you still want to take more risks, copper IUD, hormonal IUD, hormonal implant, tied tubes & expecting the men in your life to step tf up! Keep in mind that even after vasectomies it might not be safe for months & there needs to be a frequent visits to make sure sperm count is in order (plus still use condoms in addition to make sure you are safe). Never center short term convenience and pleasure over your physical safety in a society that will treat you as an incubator and is more than willing to see you dead.\n\n7) Pregnancy strike. I am not sure how any woman is still willing to pop babies... but those ideologies and rules are not only for women who don't want kids. If you want kids you are not automatically \"safe\". It could still get you killed. Consider that. \n\n8) Do not automatically trust your family, partner or doctors or anyone, if you deal with unwanted pregnancy. \n\n9) Don't leave any traces or records online those track your period & could potentially be used to incriminate you.\n\n10) Consider moving to another country if it is something you can afford. \n\n11) Have an emergency fund if that is something you can afford.\n\n12) Train & arm yourself.\n\n13) if you were contemplating divorce - go for it now",

We get to where we are in all dribs and drabs.... incremental steps that build together to make a more free and fair world. \n\nEach and every person through the course of history builds up what we have today. Think of it like each good person working toward equality was one brick that builds up the house we have. Just because the older bricks are not as shiny as the new ones does not mean they are bad. If you want to renovate, you dont remove the bricks unless you want the whole house to fall.",
         "So we excuse the racism and celebrate her? Pass. I\u2019m not interested in feminism that only applies to white women.",
         "https://www.history.com/news/suffragists-vote-black-women\n\ni don\u2019t understand why people who claim feminist beliefs fight for their own partial perspective and those before them who only fought for their own partial perspective. that\u2019s not true feminism. she was a textbook white feminist. Frances Ellen Watkins Harper, Sojourner truth ([Ain\u2019t I a woman](https://youtu.be/Ry_i8w2rdQY?si=-qAEyZmm1SQCv08m)?) literally anyone else. i don\u2019t understand why white women always do this and then beg Black and Indigenous women to do the organizing foot work they blocked multiple times and is now affecting them",
         "Seconding that this was her exact position. Also [history.com](http://history.com) isn't the best source of correct information (I'm a historian).",

         "Alice Paul in part formed her own organization because she believed that black women needed enfranchising just as much and it caused many whites of the time to be put off. If you want a radical at the time who had our modern values shes the one. \n\nNote the equal rights amendment was modified for her original demands after women got the right to vote because she knew voting alone wasn't the goal but meaningful equality.\n\nhttps://www.wesleyan.edu/mlk/posters/suffrage.html\n\nhttps://www.congress.gov/116/meeting/house/109330/documents/HHRG-116-JU10-20190430-SD013.pdf",
         "Reread your first sentence then find some actual primary sources on Susan B Anthony. Again, she did literally the opposite of fighting for \"her own partial perspective\". She fought for EVERYONE'S rights and she's being attacked here because she refused to accept a \"partial perspective\".\n\nAgain, she was a very active abolitionist, member of anti-slavery societies, part of the underground railroad and advocate for the enfranchisement of African Americans, just ALONG SIDE of Women, not INSTEAD OF Women.",
         "But, that's a very white perspective on it. I'm sure the black folks back then, both women and men, didn't see it as revolutionary",
         "Unfortunately Alice Paul has her own problems not caring about segregating Black women in the 1913 suffrage parade in DC, and turning a deaf ear to Black women's challenges in exercising their right to vote after the 19th amendment was passed.",
         "Quotes from the article I linked \n\u201cThe disagreements at that convention led not only to the dissolution of AERA, but a split in the women\u2019s suffrage movement between those who supported the 15th Amendment and those who did not. Stanton and Anthony joined the faction that did not; and after the amendment passed, many of the suffragists on that side pandered to white southerners by arguing that that if white women could vote, they could drown out the Black male vote.\u201d\n\n\u201cBoth Anthony and Stanton died more than a decade before the 19th Amendment passed. And although their work was instrumental in making that passage possible, they did not work to prioritize making voting rights accessible to all women. In 1920, Black women in the south and many Latinas in the southwest were still barred from voting because of racist voting restrictions. And when they tried to reach out to the main suffrage organizations at the time, they were ignored.\n\n\u201cThey say basically, \u2018Help us, we still can\u2019t vote,\u2019\u201d Tetrault explains. \u201cAnd those organizations basically say, \u2018That\u2019s a race question, it doesn\u2019t concern us.\u2019\u201d\u201d\n\nI am not saying these things to argue with you. I am saying these things bc they are true. Whitewashing history only benefits certain people \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f\ud83d\udc41\ufe0fbut me saying historical generations of feminism in the USA have been centered on the experiences and beliefs of white anglo , Saxon protestant women who don\u2019t really care about others partial perspectives and therefore are contradictory to the very values they\u2019re supposed to be fighting for\u2026 is problematic? ok\u2026",
         "But it's literally not true, which is why I'm asking you to GO LOOK AT PRIMARY SOURCES. Hell, you're own quote talks about the 1920 south...Susan B Anthony died in 1906. This article is nonsense.\n\nWhich isn't to say that there wasn't a significant element of racism with some elements of the Women's Suffrage movement, there absolutely was. But that's a far cry from saying that Susan B Anthony is racist."
