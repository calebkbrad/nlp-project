After my x-rays, a patient came in after me and I heard a hygienist that was helping mine talking politics with him. They were Trumpers. \n\nThen I heard the dentist come in and start talking to the other patient. Dentist is a Trumper also. At this point I put my earbuds in so I couldn't hear them. The dentist came in to talk to me about two minutes after that. I let him go through his whole spiel, and went back to the receptionist when we were done. She asked when I wanted to make an appointment. \n\nI literally told her I wasn't going to waste her time (she was nice), and that I wasn't coming back. I told her why. I said that I overheard the conversation, that our political views don't align, and that I cannot knowingly give my money to someone that supports Trump. I paid my co-pay and bounced. \n\nI am in desperate need of a tooth extraction, but I will suffer over patronizing a Trump supporter. I really wanted to let her know why, but I couldn't do it without getting angry, which would just make me look loony. \n\nI'll just eat ibuprofen (as needed) until I figure something out.",

      "title": "It\u2019s time for divorce. ",
      "text": "If you live in a red state and have been considering divorce, you need to get out now. You need to file now. The last state to enact no fault divorce was in 2010. 2010. If they can overturn Roe v. Wade, which was precedent for 50+ years, they can over turn no fault divorce. And this is one of the key signatures of the 2025 project. File now. Make a plan now. Get out now. Please leave so you\u2019re not stuck having to prove infidelity or abuse. That can be really hard to do, especially with judges who don\u2019t like women. \n\nEdit 1: I\u2019ve seen several folks asking what a \u201cno fault\u201d divorce is. I\u2019m not a lawyer, but I\u2019ll roughly explain.\n\nFirst, for those of you not in the US, you have to remember that each state has its own laws regarding marriage. The federal government does not currently define marriage, but under rulings by the US Supreme Court, the federal government can force the states to include some definitions that others don\u2019t for example Loving vs. Virginia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loving_v._Virginia), which forced states to allow interracial marriage. More recently, some states had allowed same sex marriage, but Obergefell v. Hodges (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obergefell_v._Hodges) forced all states to allow same sex marriage by saying it was a right for all citizens to marry, even if it was to someone of the same sex. \n\nSo each state has marriage laws. All states now have \u201cno fault\u201d divorce, which means that either person in a marriage can file for divorce against the other person without a reason and the court has to grant it. In past years, many states required that you prove one of three things to be able to divorce - infidelity or violence/abuse or substance abuse. Many conservative men (including our soon to be VP, JD Vance) want to end no fault divorce, so you could only get out if you prove, in a court of law, that one of those three things is true. Here is a CNN article that explain why requiring someone to be at fault (https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/27/us/no-fault-divorce-explained-history-wellness-cec/index.html) \n\nHere is a quote: \u201cBefore no-fault divorce, a woman in the US who was in an abusive or exploitative marriage didn\u2019t have many options. Husbands typically controlled a family\u2019s finances, and the social stigma for seeking divorce \u2014 not to mention the difficult process of having to prove \u201cfault\u201d \u2014 was a major deterrent. These problems got more complicated if a husband didn\u2019t want a divorce.\u201d\n\nIn the US, 70% of divorces are filed by women (https://www.whitleylawfirmpc.com/3-reasons-why-women-initiate-divorce-more-often-than-men/) and you only have to read through this sub to know why. Conservatives want to stop women from ending this marriages and they have plans to do it. \n\nEdit 2: I\u2019ve seen a couple comments about my circumstances, specifically. You can go back through my comment history or post history. I\u2019m not married. I was married for about 15 years (with two kids). We separated in 2021 and divorced in 2023. I would have been able to get divorced with a fault divorce because my ex cheated, but I spent $4000 on a lawyer (as did he) because things become somewhat contentious around the splitting of assets and child support. We did not say why we were divorcing in the paperwork. It was a no fault divorce and it still cost me $4000 and we never went to trial (and annoyingly, we came to an agreement outside of our lawyers because his lawyer was delaying things and he wanted to get remarried). So imagine what it would cost a woman trying to escape an abusive marriage from a spouse who does not want them to end the marriage. Women with limited resources would have no means of escape. \n\nAs a side note, I don\u2019t hate men and if you\u2019re happy in your marriage\u2026great. But I\u2019m sending this warning out for women who are unsafe and unhappy to get out now. My ex and I get along well, now. We have 50/50 custody of our kids, live four blocks from each other, coparent well, celebrate holidays and birthdays together and like each other\u2019s new partners. It is the best case scenario post divorce, but it is exceedingly rare. ",

         "I have two family stories to tell, and they're basically the good side and the bad of women and their experiences back in the day.\n\nMy Granny (great grandmother, born 1888, died 1983) was a strong as hell lady. She was a farmer, owned her land, voted in every election from 1920 until she died. She was widowed in 1928, with 5 daughters under age 10. The woman worked. She sent all of her daughters through high school during the great depression, even when that required paying for their room and board in town. Granny wasn't a cuddly woman, but she bleeping loved all of us kids, and lived a humble and quietly generous life.\n\nAfter my grandmother (Granny's youngest daughter) graduated from high school in 1942, Granny remarried. I don't know whether there was a great romance or something. I do know that (per family lore,) the second husband wasn't the kind of worker Granny was. Apparently, the divorce happened after Granny had been in the field all morning, went to take a break after the mail ran, and got upset because her then husband had just risen and picked up her (weekly rural) newspaper from the table in the front room. Granny told the man that it was her paper, she paid for it, and she'd read it first, thankyouverymuch. He got his galluses in a bind and declared that he'd go buy his own paper.\n\nWhen he got back from the nearest store (at least 5 miles of dirt road each way,) all of his worldly goods were in the ditch across the road, and Granny was sitting on her front porch, with a shotgun laying across her lap, reading her newspaper. \n\nMuch darker: I had a relative by marriage who didn't talk about it much, but apparently grew up with a horrifically abusive father. According to all the stories I heard, from multiple sources that seem reliable, the in-law's mother took the worst, because she tried to protect her children. There were few resources for a victim of domestic violence in that time and place.\n\nAfter the youngest child established his own separate home, the abused wife committed a murder-suicide. She apparently gut-shot her husband, watched him suffer and die, and then cleanly shot herself. The children had a funeral for her. They never claimed his body.",

Democrats are policy wonking in an age of populism. \n\nThe Democratic party is absolutely better for the economy... but the economy doesn't really serve the working class. The economy was great under Biden, but we all saw money work less for us, and work more for the wealthy. \n\nThat translated to \"Dems? Meh,\" for a lot of voters.\n\nAnd that isn't their fault. You can't individually blame all the 15M voters who didn't care to show up. That is not how systemic problems work.  \n\nThe Electorate is moving Left, but the party keeps going Right. This L was coming. It just came at the worst time. The Democratic party failed to align with the needs and inclinations of their base, so they failed.\n\nThis is Kamala's fault, and Biden's, but more than anyone, it's the DNC's fault, with their hundreds of billionaire-bought soulless advisors taking money to ensure the policies continue to favor the rich. \n\nSo what it amounts to is we have two parties paying the game the same way, but the GOP was always better at being corrupt. The Democratic party never answered the call of the voter who hated the corruption and wanted policies more to the Left. The Democrats abandoned Medicare for All. They abandoned progressive tax policy. \n\nPut the blame where it lies. This is a party failure. \n\nIf we have elections again, and if the Democrats move Left and start to put people like Bernie and AOC and Tim Walz out front, maybe they will do better. \n\nBut I doubt our institutions hold. The Right was losing power every cycle. They won't let it go willingly. The time will come when they falter, though. Fascists can't endure long in places with a strong democratic tradition.",

If this wasn't happening right now it would have been a landslide in the other direction. I would not be surprised if the Hamas attacks were actually false flags at this point.\n\nTrump got less votes than he did last time. \n\nKamala got way less than Biden did.\n\nPeople stayed home because people are assholes and didn't pay attention.

Yea his base loved every minute of it, but even most voters - particularly swing voters - just aren't plugged into mainstream political news or ongoings. \n\nWhy did they vote for Trump? Rampant inequality and the cost of living is still squeezing the working class. The inflation was far more Trump's fault than anything else, but again, *these people don't understand politics or economics with that level of complexity.* \n\nSo they still feel left behind, and they have economic concerns. Aggregate classical measures of the economy are biased towards the rich, measuring high-water marks and ignoring the human pain at the lower ends of all of the numbers. And Republican feaux-populism addresses those fears - even if stupidly and dishonestly. \n\nHarris never appealed to voters strongly and clearly enough on this issue. Those people want either snappy slogans that they can cling to, or clear and bold promises. Harris didn't do either. I remember her talking about small business loans (most people aren't entrepreneurs, so the vague promise of \"more jobs\" through that just isn't landing with people) and some mention of the CHIPs act (too nebulous for most people, and not appealing to every industry) as well as her touting Biden's nice \"soft landing\" on inflation. I don't remember anything else sticking. I may have missed something, but I'm as plugged in as anyone can be and was out knocking doors and I don't know what else she was promising on the economy. At the time I was okay with it because I thought everyone else thought Trump was awful and the hope of a young candidate was exciting and a little blinding. \n\nDems have abandoned the labor class, and in doing so have also effectively alienated white and Latino men - and even kept lots of white women away!\n\nWe don't have to appeal to masculinity directly to win more of that demographic, but we *do* have to understand their anxieties and fears. And it's the economy. \n\nAnd don't get me wrong. There is real hatred and sexism and racism out there as well. But Harris didn't even get all of Biden's voters back out in 2024, much less convince the Swing voters. That's a bad campaign.",
         "I think people who are saying that, and frankly I really haven't seen that sentiment, are using that as a scapegoat for other reasons they voted against Kamala.\n\nThings like the switch to Biden feeling more like an \"anyone but Trump\" campaign rather than a uniquely positioned campaign, Democrats in generally spending exorbitant amounts of money on that to boot (so many of the ads I saw for the Harris campaign were basically just anti-trump ads more than simple and understandable appeals to goals and concerns of potential voters), without addressing the plethora of misinformed statements by the Trump campaign (eg., thinking Harris wanted to tax everyone's 401k and remove their Social Security benefits).",

I'd say so.  Was it amazing?  I wouldn't say that.  Was she held to a higher standard than Trump?  Certainly.

      "text": "I (20F) had been dating this guy (24M) for about one month when we had a conversation about abortion. We hadn't had sex before because I had an iffy feeling about him but I couldn't say why so I didn't even let him kiss me or anything. \n\nBy the way I live in an European country where you can abort up to 12 weeks and don't really face any problems regarding that besides maybe the high price for the abortion. \n\nIt's always been a sensitive topic for me, even though I consider myself a rational person. In past relationships, I\u2019ve brought it up early to see where the guy stands, and both of my exes gave what I considered the perfect response: \"I don't have an opinion, it's the woman's choice, and I\u2019ll support whatever she decides.\" So when I asked this guy about it, I was not expecting his answer. I mean I kind of did since he always claims to be traditional, which he isn't exactly since he smokes, drinks a lot and talks about sex a lot even though I told him it makes me uncomfortable. \n\nHe told me, \"I wouldn't love the woman anymore if she got an abortion and killed our child. I'd be too sad to know she killed our love. I would leave her.\" \n\nI was honestly shocked. First of all, \"killed\" isn\u2019t the right term, and second of all - what? He quickly tried to backpedal, adding things like, \"It\u2019s okay if the woman's life is in danger\" and \"No, I wouldn\u2019t leave you.\" But he kept justifying his position by bringing up his faith, which felt especially disrespectful. Until now, he barely mentioned his religion, but suddenly it was the reason behind his opinion. \n\nWhat really upset me, though, was when he said, \"Women nowadays go to clubs, sleep around, and then get abortions. They kill children. It shouldn\u2019t be normalized. Most women are whores. They treat abortion like it\u2019s going to McDonald's.\" This was just disgusting. I told him how dangerous and hurtful those kinds of generalizations are, especially considering how many women in the US are suffering because of abortion bans. I think it's heartbreaking that men who don\u2019t understand the reality of women\u2019s health and autonomy think they should have a say in something so personal.\n\nHe got angry and tried to deflect, saying, \"You always act all traditional and arrogant, but you sent me a picture of your boobs.\" To clarify, it was a bikini pic, just showing him that my top didn\u2019t fit properly since we were talking about women's sizing including bras and it wasn\u2019t sexual. Also, he had pictures in his Instagram highlights where his female friends were wearing bikinis. But he used that as a way to shame me, which was infuriating. He was always the one bringing up sexual questions, even when I told him it made me uncomfortable, and yet he tried to play the \"traditional\" card.\n\nAfter that, I was done. I told him I never wanted to hear from him again because his views were harmful and disrespectful. That was a couple of days ago and he\u2019s been spamming my phone every day, begging for another chance, telling me I\u2019m his \"dream wife,\" (probably because he is into my looks and me wanting to be a tradwife) and even saying he\u2019d change his views for me. \n\nI can\u2019t be with someone like that. Not only do I disagree with his stance, but it also breaks my heart to see how many women, especially in places like the US, are suffering because of abortion bans. I read everyday the articles and I pray for the women in the US. This is now a deeply personal issue for me, and I can\u2019t be with a man who doesn\u2019t respect a woman\u2019s right to choose.\n\nExtra: He also mentioned how he had rejected girls because they already took of their clothes by the second date. He let them feel comfortable enough to do that, so he isn't in a position to shame anyone. Also, he tried to kiss and hold my hands on the first few dates a couple of times and I didn't let him so huh, who is the problem. Also, in my last relationships I already had sex or kissed them by the third date because I don't care about how long we are dating - when I trust you then I trust you. It doesn't matter how early or late a woman decides to have sex and it doesn't determinate her worth. \n",

But their lives and/or health would have been destroyed if they continued the pregnancy - and as a generalisation for most of their situations - they had ended up pregnant by crappy partners who would be unwilling and awful fathers. \n\nThe most heartbreaking one was a woman who was unwittingly pregnant when given a certain life-saving medication, which would have 100% led to terrible birth defects. She would have loved another child, but it would have destroyed her family having to prove 24/7 care for a child with extreme needs, if she even survived the pregnancy, which was definitely a huge question mark after two traumatic C-sections and tons of scar tissue. And so, heartbreaking decision, but necessary. \n\nThat's the reality. An abortion is not like buying fast food, JFC. It's an emergency procedure and it's rare to have one. It's not easy, it's not nice, but it's necessary. \n\nAnd if there was some living parody of a \"nasty woman\" who was getting an abortion every weekend, then why isn't she being given the option of sterilisation? And what about the man/men getting her pregnant? Why aren't they being hunted down with the same fury? Why isn't there a global campaign to stop men impregnating all these women? Why is it all on women? It takes two to tango. \n\nThe whole argument absolutely stinks when you point out why men aren't being held accountable for all these wild pregnancies. It's then you cannot deny the misogyny. It's the woman's fault, every time. Even if she was raped. \n\nI cannot believe the idiocy, misinformation, more idiocy and total lies surrounding this entire argument about a health procedure. \n\nBut this is the world we live in, now.

This is a misunderstanding of how victims respond to trauma, particularly in abusive relationships.\u00a0\n\n\n>By framing the emotional attachment of hostages to their captors as a syndrome, Bejerot pathologized and oversimplified the behavior of victims, particularly women.\u00a0\n\n\n>Stockholm Syndrome has been perpetuated as something that only affects women. It suggests that women are more likely to submit to or romanticize abusive situations, reinforcing traditional gender roles that view women as the nurturing and vulnerable ones.\u00a0\n\n\n>It's also often romanticized, framing it as a love story rather than a psychological response to trauma.\u00a0\n\n\n>This perspective obscures the realities of coercion and manipulation that characterize abusive relationships, further perpetuating the idea that women are incapable of self-determination.",

Harris had a 6 percentage point advantage. Hillary had 18, Biden 25. Young people shifted to Trump.\n\n* Young women. Harris won then by 12 points, Biden won them by 24, twice the gap in 2020 vs. 2024.\n\n* Women in general. Trump won 42% of the women's vote in 2016, then 43% in 2020, increasing it again to 45% in 2024.\n\n* White women. They have only voted for the Democrat twice, in 1964 for Johnson and 1996 for Bill Clinton. Trump captured 52% of their vote. (Higher than that for older white women.)\n\n* White men. Trump won white men by 20 points, which is massive. However, he won white men by 24 points in 2020, so he lost some white male support. \n\n* Black men. Harris won 80% of Black men, when this whole election we were told black men wouldn't vote for her, and that they were [intellectually deficient](https://x.com/kbyrd2_/status/1853883382998204681?s=46) because of that.\n\n* Black women. Harris won 93% of their vote.\n\n* Trump has (somehow) diversified the GOP in ways the Democrats took for granted. The Harris vote was much less diverse (by half) than the Biden vote in 2020.\n\n\n\n* Hispanic women. Clinton won them by 44 points, Harris won them by 24 points. That's a massive shift of 20 points. \n\n* Hispanic men. In 2016, Clinton won Latino men by 31 points. In 2020, Biden won them by 23 points. In 2024, Trump won then by 10 points. That's a shift of 41 and 33 points. That's not just a slice of voters, that's a wholesale reversal. \n\n\nThe DNC basically has blood on its hands for how horribly it misjudged this electorate and how badly it has run its elections.\n\n> The Harris campaign tried, with good reason, to convince white women that their future was at stake. Trump is all but guaranteed to oversee a further rollback in reproductive rights, and the president-elect has also openly flirted with a federal ban on abortion. \n\n>And yet that was not a winning message for white women, at 52%. A recent Times/Siena showed that the majority of white women, like their white male counterparts, saw inflation and the economy as their top voting issue. Abortion was second, and immigration was third. To be sure, there is a notable age split here: Gen Z women only went 36 percent for Trump, women aged 30 to 44 went 41 percent for Trump, women aged 45 to 64 went 48 percent for Trump, and women over 65 backed the former president 45 percent.",

Can we really wonder why they uphold the patriarchy, yte supr3macy, misogyny? I think cult methods of control are used on a pretty big portion of the population. Parents, teachers, social media. They all use behaviourism to control a vulnerable population (children) who grow up to be voting adults.\n\nIn terms of direct election results, foreign influence propaganda is not an insignificant effect. No one is above it and no one can critically think their way out of being influenced by propaganda. Personally, I think it is a pointless exercise in trying to blame these women. I think efforts need to move towards breaking down systems of propaganda and oppression and manipulation of children. \n\nIt seems the education divide is well correlated with the election results, except for black women who sent that rapist a message.

Make them live in constant paranoia of being disliked and worthless unless they act the way we want them to (which is with empathy lmao) just like the world has programmed us to do. \n\nEdit 2: Want to clarify something. 4B isn't about punishment or hatred.

Because if he truly did love me he wouldn't treat me like this after the breakup.\n\nHe has pretty much made me realize that one can never trust men.\n\nAnd let me tell you, he was for a big big portion a good man when we were together.

The people who keep having kids and teaching their kids those \"family values.\"\n\n4B is a nice thought, but it dooms society to be even more patriarchal in 30 years' time. Do whatever you want, of course, I'm not trying to tell you what to do or not do. But I'm letting you know you should think farther ahead about the long term consequences, not just the immediate consequences of your actions.\n\nLook at Mormon populations, they are absolutely booming. They have tons of kids and indoctrinate them well. Sure some will leave the church but they are breeding much faster than losing members. Meanwhile the feminists numbers are plummeting because they don't want kids, so they must rely on \"converts\" to join the cause.\n\nThis is not even a philosophical or moral argument, this is simple math. Just play this out, in 60 years or 100 years, do you think we will have more feminists or more Mormons?\n\nBeing a woman is not like being in a union where everyone can get on the same page and negotiate as a group. Maybe if all women belong to the \"woman\" union, 4B can work and successfully change society. But there is a huge amount of diversity in women, especially in the US. When only a small percentage of a workforce is unionized, the union basically has zero power.\n\nThe result of 4B in the US will just be that the men will find Trump-supporting women to date and marry and have kids with. Just check the election results, there are *plenty* of them, and their numbers are growing, and will keep growing as they have more kids than feminist women.\n\nI understand the cause of 4B, I really do. It is a gasp for some shred of power and self determination. It is honorable and beautiful and affirming. It is a powerful middle finger to the powers that be. But it is incredibly short sighted, because it guarantees that the other side will be *more* powerful after you die.",

The general sentiment of losing trust all around and now living by the, \"Trust but verify\" method. \n\nWeeks after Roe v Wade was overturned, I asked my wife how she felt. After talking about it for weeks, I asked her if she was still entertaining the idea of children together. She said no, not really, and I felt the same. We fortunately live in a state where a life saving abortion would be legal and allowed(for now), so we kept our regimen of safe practices to avoid getting pregnant. \n\nFast forward to Trump getting the candidacy locked in, I told my wife I simply couldn't ask her to carry a baby, risking her life, with the thought that a federal abortion ban was very possible under a second clown presidency. \n\nOur decision was made for us with the results on Tuesday. I'll be getting a vasectomy and we will not be having children. \n\nI had hope this nation would change for the better as Boomers started falling off, but we were shown the generations that followed and the brain rotted gen Z, do not care about much else than \"the economy\", which is really just caring solely about *their* economy at home. Themselves. \n\nI am very grateful to have met my wife. She opened me up to countless experiences, opinions, and feelings I don't fully understand because they are not 100% mine, but are invaluable because they come from the source: a woman. \n\nI'm almost excited to inform my parents, who are blind conservative voters, as to what some personal consequences are of only thinking about \"ma guns\" and \"god\" when considering our entire nation. My mom thinks I will have tons of kids and be a great dad while also still trying to convince me to become a Preacher(I'm atheist, openly). They already ran off my brother, who is gay and has a wonderful partner he loves, because they are absolutely ignorant to the struggles anyone else has. \n\nMy heart goes out to the people who feel struggles i can't comprehend as a white male. I have the pit in my stomach now too. I won't allow anger to fill it, there is enough of that. No..I am going to work twice as hard to be vocal, active, informed, and supportive. \n\nGood luck everyone, we have to adjust the bring the fight harder next time. We have to fight to push push push to make sure *everyone* can feel safe someday.",

Really, unless you're a boy lucky to grow up in a family that has a strong male role model, you're fucked. I'm just really lucky my dad is such a positive, kind person and I've really become a better man because of him (I haven't ever expressed that to him but probably should).\n\nAnyway, I'm not excusing this behaviour and it really sucks that this 4B movement is happening as a result of this.

Thinking about that scenario is enraging, how frightening and callous that is. \n\nSo when Trump people tell me they think they aren't bad people, \"Half the country\" this or that, I just laugh. \n\nYou are a bad person, because on top of a million other examples you're willing to let my wife bleed out and die on a dice roll if she gets pregnant, because you want eggs to go down 35 cents, or think Imani Khelif is a man. \n\nYou are my enemy at that point.

Dating the wrong guys because they enjoy the thrill, and then having that become a lifetime habit. \n\nThose girls and those teens are the ones who need to learn to respect themselves. To protect themselves. To know they can make their own path to life. To understand the life or death consequences of sex even though their teen brains don\u2019t do well at thinking about consequences. \n\nUntil that happens, this cycle will keep on going. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong - it\u2019s never a bad time to start having good standards and boundaries.

And that\u2019s fine. \n\nBut how can those younger women be helped? How can the message reach them, especially now as things will begin to clamp down on any \u201cunacceptable\u201d messages?

Always think first if this interaction serves you and your goals. You don't even have to actively refuse or have a confrontation -  just quietly quit.\n\nAlso we need to talk about the women in our lives that prop up toxic masculinity/patriarchy. Resist them - resist their norms. Don't let them get to you - be the calm reasonable one - but assertive. Stop people pleasing - or seeking approval from these women.

All that happened while the man who put those judges on the stand wasn't even in office or flexing his influence in an official capacity.\n\nTo add gas to that fire, thst same court wrote an opinion outlining how a sitting president basically can't be convicted of any crime for actions they take while in office just in time for perhaps the most sued / legally dubious man in the history of this nation to get back in the oval office.

Yes of course some of them come to the other side, but having a cultural default is incredibly powerful.

Again, I'm just saying that any movement that has kids and propagates their values will keep growing, and any movement that doesn't have kids or fails to propagate values will keep declining. It's simple math. \n\nYes it's possible to propagate values without having kids, by gaining converts, doing public education, but that's much harder, and riskier in the long run. \n\nIn some sense there will always be converts to feminism in a repressive patriarchal society, but the issue isn't feminism going to zero, the issue is feminism never having more than a tipping point of support that lets the movement actually enact policies.",

I\u2019ve been on the fence because I\u2019ve been there done that and I\u2019m perfectly happy with my life the way it is.\n\nThis morning, I told my boyfriend I\u2019m not getting pregnant during this next administration or while we live in Texas because I\u2019m not willing to die if some complication arises during the pregnancy. We can\u2019t move because of a child custody arrangement I have here. So Texas is the hellscape we\u2019re bound to.\n\nI asked if he would stay with me now that he knew where I stood. He said he wasn\u2019t sure because having a child and a family of his own was important to him. I asked if he was open to adoption or fostering. And after some back and forth trying to pull the answer out of him. He said no. The only way he\u2019d consider that is if he couldn\u2019t have them himself.\n\nI doubled down on my stance that I won\u2019t be getting pregnant. And by the time a new administration and new policies roll around, that\u2019ll put us approaching 40 and past the point of having a child.\n\nI told him he needed to think about it. Really think about it and have an answer for me before this weekend. I was supposed to meet his parents on Sunday. He was supposed to meet my family during the Thanksgiving holiday.\n\nThat conversation was 3 hours ago. He\u2019s cried on his own. I\u2019ve cried on my own. I\u2019m pretty sure I know his answer at this point.\n\nIt hurts to realize that what we have isn\u2019t enough for him. That his vision for his future doesn\u2019t necessarily include me if I can\u2019t provide him his idealistic family. It feels like he wasn\u2019t with me out of love, but out of prospect.\n\nEdit: Y\u2019all are truly amazing. Thank you for the support. I\u2019ve read almost every comment. And most are very insightful. Even the less supportive ones. This isn\u2019t easy for any of us. But it\u2019s life, we do what we can to keep living. I wish you all as much peace and happiness as possible. Someone mentioned that we have to stop crying under the covers and get behind a podium and I couldn\u2019t agree more. I\u2019ll be getting involved with my local organizations. I hope you all decide to too.",

It\u2019s dangerous, and you clearly have other children to worry about. Miscarriages are not rare!!",

If there was a law in place that he had to report your pregnancy and miscarriage the authorities\u2026 would he be willing to break the law to protect you? If your life was endangered due to the pregnancy, how many thousands of dollars would he pay to fly you to somewhere safe? Is there a limit to how much money he would spend? Would he be able to his or would he need to tell his family? And then maybe he would tell the government?",

You've had time to think about this and consider things and live through the experiences he wants. For him, he's still mourning what he hoped his life would be. Ultimately though, he has his priorities and you have yours. It sucks that these decisions and conversations are being had everywhere across the country right now.\n\nWould you be able to modify your custody agreement?

If I cant advocate and make the decisions you want (as next of kin) in an emergency, then I dont want to take that chance\u201d \n\nWe have decided to look into freezing some embryos incase we change our minds in the future.

As someone who quite some years ago has been on the other end of a similar conversation (turned out to be moot in the end and a no-kids-not-by-choice situation), it\u2019s an incompatibility issue with no blame to place on either side IMO. He\u2019s apparently always been upfront about wanting kids, and it\u2019s ok that he still wants that, and of course it\u2019s entirely, 100% understandable that you don\u2019t want to risk it under the current situation. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t diminish the love you had for each other. People can love each other and STILL walk away if they have fundamentally different ideas of what they want out of life.",

I wanted that baby, and something had happened in my body that prevented that baby from living -- it was a horrible feeling. \n\nThe one feeling I didn't have was fear. I didn't fear that my life was in danger, I didn't fear that if I went to the hospital they wouldn't help me because of some decision a politician made. No one should feel this way when they are in the midst of a miscarriage or other type of pregnancy loss. This feels like it should be a basic human right.",

Once Roe v Wade was overturned the hope of trying for a biological child died. So we looked at adoption. Certainly there would be a child out there who needed us. This election killed that dream too. I no longer want children. I can't bring myself to raise a child in this world anymore. How can you raise a tiny human in a place that you know is actively becoming worse? How can you comfort a child when you know they don't have a future? Literally my one dream I've had for the past 28 years is gone. I feel so lost, so empty inside.

         "From one Mike to another. Regardless of the statistics you're quoting, each woman has the absolute right to make decisions about her own body and reproductive choices. This isn't about \"not getting her way in one election\" - it's about her personal assessment of risks she's willing to take with her life and health. She's being incredibly thoughtful and upfront with her partner about her boundaries and concerns.\n\nNo one should have to justify their reproductive choices with statistics. The reality is that any risk of death or serious complications is a valid concern, and she's the only one who gets to decide if that risk is acceptable to her. The risk of dying in a plane crash is extremely low statistically, but imagine if someone not only forced you onto that plane while you were terrified, but also took away your right to get off if something started going wrong during the flight. Those statistics wouldn't matter much to you then, would they? That fear and loss of control would be very real. The feelings are real. Yet, you nor I will ever experience it. \n\nInstead of dismissing her very real concerns, perhaps consider that she's making a difficult but clear-eyed decision about her future. She's being honest with her partner and giving him the respect of making his own informed choice as well. That's not \"blowing up her life\" - that's being a responsible adult who knows her own mind.\n\nSometimes people have fundamentally different life goals, and recognizing that early is far better than compromising on something as life-changing as having children. Maybe you should respect her agency in making this decision rather than trying to minimize her valid concerns. Baring that, respectively stay in your lane.",
         "Uhm, no. \n\nFirst of all, pregnancy is the most dangerous time in a women\u2019s life, period (not just from medical complications either) so acting like there is little risk for a pregnant woman is just not accurate. 6-8% of pregnancies are considered high risk. The US has a higher maternal death rate than other comparable countries, and that was from data before abortion was banned/limited. You are also only using statistics for the mother\u2019s mortality, never mind the long term complications that the woman could experience if there was a medical situation and the mother lived. But even if you want to focus on death rates only, the statistics you are providing are not accurate to the real threat today for a woman, because they are from when abortion was legal and more easily accessible - mortality rates are going to go up a significant amount now. In fact, 4 in 5 pregnancy related deaths were already considered preventable, so going back to the 6-8% being high risk pregnancies, a significant amount of them that would have been prevented previously are no longer going to be prevented.\n\nSecondly that medical malpractice lawsuit is not going to result in hospitals acting quicker. They have malpractice insurance, they won\u2019t pay out of their pocket for any claims, their insurance will, and the doctors are more concerned for themselves being charged with a crime than with a civil suit resulting in monetary damages. Doctors have already come out to say this while sending a petition to the government about the recent teenager dying.",

I feel like I must've been very close to death at that point, because I've never felt like the world was so surreal. And while it would've been very terrifying under normal circumstances, I think I was too sick & delirious to know how scary that truly was. I can't imagine going through all of that while pregnant and possibly going through a myriad of other pregnancy issues. That sounds like pure torture. No woman should be forced into facing that because of dumb legislation. \n\nI'm in CO, so I'm very lucky atm. We codified both abortion rights (along with allowing taxes to help pay for them, and forcing Medicaid coverage) and gay marriage rights.

My second is a typical kid. \n\nMy husband and I had wanted a big family but we met in our 30s and were later starting a family. We had a few nights away from the kids going to a music festival and had a conversation about how we'd like another baby but it is so nice that the kids are getting bigger and more self sufficient and can be left with their grandmother for a few nights without too much hassle. I joked that we should leave it up to the universe and if the universe wanted us to have another baby then it would happen (knowing that I have a 15% at my age on any given cycle and significantly less than that since I was on birth control). \n\nPoof. 3 weeks later I tested positive.",

         "Universe was listening! You may end up with that big family after all.",
         "Yes, and it\u2019s also true that women at 40 are more likely to struggle and seek fertility treatment. I 100% do not subscribe to the idea that our ovaries are shriveling on the vine at 35 and I\u2019m certainly glad we have dispelled those myths. But really, I am saying this from an evidence-based place: most 40 y/o women aren\u2019t gonna have a baby. Not without help, and maybe not even then. 40 y/o\u2019s are overrepresented at fertility clinics\u2026 because our fertility at 40 is precarious at best. Our likelihood of a pregnancy steeply drops around 39. Age is a huge negative indicator for fertility whether you have fertility problems or not. If you do, your chances are that much worse. If you don\u2019t, by the time you hit 40 your chances of being diagnosed as infertile are much higher. I dunno why folks are railing so hard against this. \n\nLike, it\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t want to try for a baby till you\u2019re 40. For some that bet will pay off. For a significant number of us it won\u2019t. If you want to wait till 40 I\u2019d strongly suggest freezing embryos now. Most women do not have good enough egg reserve for IVF at 40 and you\u2019ll probably need donor eggs. I don\u2019t really care to argue minutia. It\u2019s just how it is. We have finite eggs and we stop producing certain hormones in high numbers as we age. Some women get lucky at 40 but that in no way means we can hang our hopes on our chances. You can\u2019t know until you are there and the heartache when you realize it\u2019s too late will be all-consuming. If you want to play those odds because you\u2019re sure I\u2019m wrong have fun. But I wouldn\u2019t recommend it.",
         "Tbh, I have terminal cancer so I am interested this veil feeling because I will be facing death \n\nIf you don\u2019t mind (it\u2019s totally okay if you do) was it a feeling of peace or just disconnection?

I could go on and on, but it's nice to run into a fellow Coloradan here. I wish you all the best and I'll be by your side whatever happens in the future here.",
         "No, it\u2019s fine.  Main note is that I can\u2019t vouch for how it is for anyone else, just myself.\n\nI\u2019ve been relatively close to death I think 3 times so far, and it\u2019s all been relatively similar.  The biggest feeling is just exhaustion.  I would feel so incredibly, overwhelmingly tired where just falling asleep is the most tempting thing in the world.  Staying awake and aware is so much work and it\u2019s so easy to just let go and slip away.  I don\u2019t know if I would describe it as peaceful but it definitely wasn\u2019t scary until I got better enough to contextualize everything.  At the time it was just like\u2026calm?  I weirdly had no anxiety and even though I knew I wasn\u2019t doing well, it didn\u2019t matter.  I felt like I would just accept whatever happened if I could just rest.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry for what you are going through, that\u2019s an incredible psychological challenge.  I think that the actual dying part isn\u2019t that bad in the moment, it just feels like finally being able to rest after so much suffering.  Obviously the situations aren\u2019t the same since ultimately I could recover, but in the moment actually experiencing it?  It was a relief.  I\u2019d definitely say that you shouldn\u2019t worry about the actual dying part.  You should be loaded up with morphine and the scary part will just be seeing your loved ones so sad and thinking about what you will miss out on, not the actual process of dying.\n\nI\u2019m sorry if that reply is too presumptuous on my part.",
         "Yeah, sadly the whole stapling ranked choice voting to jungle primaries is what killed it 100%.  I\u2019m hoping that they can drop the jungle primaries and just put ranked choice on the ballot in 2 years if possible because I would love to see how it does then!\n\nAlso, thank you!  Given how we\u2019ve enshrined abortion rights I get the feeling that we are gonna have to be there for women from Texas, Oklahoma, etc as well."

It has always been in the back of my mind that I am prone to complications. I  mean, endometriosis alone causes several.

I cannot predict the future so rather than taking that chance, today I made it abundantly clear that I will not be trying for any more children and if anyone asks they will receive an earful as to why.\n\n  \nI come from a conservative, republican, Catholic family.

When I asked him why, just because I wanted to understand, he said he liked trmp\u2019s policies more, but that he also didn\u2019t want to talk about politics with me at the moment. I started crying. He instantly tried comforting me. He said he doesn\u2019t want politics to come between us. How can I still love him like I do? I\u2019m so confused and I don\u2019t want to leave him over this. It would actually break me. He\u2019s the sweetest person in general that I\u2019ve ever met, and you would never know he was a republican just by talking to him because he seems to just care about everyone around him so much. Does this make me complicit? Am I becoming part of the problem? What do I even do?",

I think you really need to have a conversation with him about the reasons he would vote that way when it's clear he's voting for a party that cares little for anybody who is not a white male. The only way to get past this wall is to have the conversation and see if redemption is possible.",

Trump's *entire platform* is about the destruction of human rights, and *anyone* who tries to pretend like there's any merit to the republican platform at *all* in 2024 is a disgusting human being who is either full of hate or too selfish to care about anyone but themselves (aka our favorite, priveleged white men). Maybe it wasn't always that way, obviously it *shouldn't* be that way, but it is. \n\nAnyone who can't face it and accept it is not deserving of your time, attention, or love. Throw him in the garbage. There is absolutely, unequivocally no way to reconcile 'love' with voting the way he did. The only people voting red are: genuinely clueless, brainwashed, coerced, or - most commonly - monstrous. \n\n'I don't want to talk about politics' just means I don't give a shit about your rights and never will. This is how it is now. There is no grey area, there's no, 'wElL bOtH sIdEs HaVe ThEiR iSsUeS.' There is voting for progress, rights for women, people of color, and those in the LGBT+ community, and there is voting *against* those same rights and progress. Not our fault either.

He might be good at putting on that appearance, but when it comes down to it, he\u2019s selfish enough to disregard the harm that he\u2019s helped cause.  He\u2019s willing to vote for an administration that would actively put your life at risk if you ever need another abortion.\n\nI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through this.

If they want to value their red baseball caps and orange douchebag dictator more than our lives and safety as human beings than let them lose us and keep him. Its clear that by voting not just for Trump but republicans down ballet he neither sees you as an equal human being because of your gender nor does he truly prioritize your safety. He is willing to live in a world in which he lets conservative men risk your health, safety and even untimatly your very life. You might think you know this man but maybe you misjudged him.

We try and decide who will do the greatest good for the greatest number of people and who will do the most harm to the greatest number of people. We get informed, or at least try, and we do the hard math...and still don't arrive at the same conclusions.\n\nSometimes the morality/amorality of these choices have casualties, and often those casualties are loved ones.

Honestly, in that world...if you were worrying about being pregnant before, you would have had to worry for at least 3 more years.\n\nCurrently (depending on where you live) now might be the SAFEST time to be pregnant. In states with abortion rights, the GOP can't do anything. Once Jan 20, 2025 hits...I don't think a ban will come immediately. I think it may take a year. There will be clammorings for an abortion ban nationally, and we can't trust the GOP to not go along and try. They WILL ban abortion drugs crossing state lines, that will be quick. A flat ban, truth is 50% chance it even happens...and will certainly be at least a year before taking effect.\n\nNow, say you are in a state with NO abortion protections: it is more grim than you think (sorry). Trump will get 2 more justices on SCOTUS, which will enshrine Dobbs for at least 25 years. So, no help within the next 4 years minimum.\n\nNow, say Dems take power in 2028...we will have to see. Truth is, same analysis from the first situation, they won't pass national abortion rights immediately. The bill will take time, be contested tooth and nail, and won't even be possible with certain margins of victory. And if they get passed, any law will CERTAINLY be litigated for years, and end up with (possibly even more) conservative SCOTUS.\n\nThis election wasn't about having abortion rights in 2025...it was really about having a chance at them by late 2026. Now, BEST case nationally is 2030.

He convinced me that his girlfriend was extremely abusive to him. I'll keep this short and just tell you all I hated this woman from the bottom of my heart for what she \"did\" to him. So I justified how he left her - he moved out with the promise that it was only because he had gotten a great job and he'd be sending her money until they got back on their feet. I thought this was for his safety and I supported it.\n\nAnd then he did the same to me. We were married for 10 years. Our relationship started shortly after he \"got out\". I thought things were great but apparently that was just me. His reddit account is dripping in thirst posts on the mutual masturbation subreddits. I didn't know this til later. \n\nHe stopped coming home to our marital home.

But your comment happened to put me on a train of thought that snowballed and I just ended up with an autistic brain dump of a comment.\n\nI remember reading about this study where they surveyed a ton of couples with objective \"does your partner do x, y, z?\" types of questions as well as more subjective ones, all pertaining to different degrees and forms of abuse. The findings were very interesting.\n\nBy contrasting the objective and subjective responses, they found that women are much more likely to recognize abusive behavior as abuse. They found that emotional abuse was split pretty evenly according to the objective responses, but men responded in the subjective portion that their partners were not abusive despite indicating abuse in the objective portion far more often than the women, showing that most men simply don't understand what constitutes abuse.\n\nThose findings were actually fortified when split for same-sex couples where gay men's relationships reported around half the abuse of hetero relationships and lesbian relations reported twice as much abuse according to the subjective portions, but I believe the objective portions were still about the same. Most LGBTQ people carry a lot of trauma, though, so I think there's probably a lot to be compensated for to properly understand some of those dynamics.\n\nThat's not to say men are the victim, though. That lack of understanding goes both ways in that men are also less likely to recognize their own behaviors as abusive. I think this is also why it's so important to say \"I\" instead of \"you\" when communicating. When we say \"I feel this way about...\" we frame it from a personal perspective and when we say \"you x/y/z\" we're framing it as though it's fact, and that can potentially be a form of abuse.\n\nI think this lack of understanding is a large part of why men will use words like \"crazy\" or \"bitch\". Whether their partner is abusive or not is irrelevant, abuse is wrong, but as the study shows, most men won't recognize that behavior as abusive in either direction.\n\nPersonally, my gender identity is a little bit washy, I've never considered myself to be a \"man\", adult male sure, that's biology, but the notion of manhood doesn't really resonate with me and feels somewhat alien (gender identity can be different for those with autism). Nonetheless, I still try to view myself through the analytical lens applied to men's behavior.",

She\u2019s not a happy person and just wants other women to get punished and \u201cface the same consequences\u201d that she did. She won\u2019t stop listening to Christmas music with no headphones today and I hate her.",

So they lost there\u2019s and fuck everyone else. \n\nShe said she didn\u2019t want her kid to go to war. Russia is now free to take Ukraine and will probably try to take any other ex-Soviet countries they can. That will probably start a war within nato in the next 10 years when her children are prime military age. \n\nWe live amongst selfish idiots.",

I want to somehow express hope for the future but right now I\u2019m afraid we lost a major election that this country may never recover from.  I see many women who are married to Trump supporters and I just don\u2019t understand it.  They vote for Trump right alongside their husbands.  As a 37 year old male I am very worried about the future.  I can\u2019t even begin to understand how women in this country feel after this horrific event.

         "Time to pick up Andrea Dworkin\u2019s Right Wing Women again: \n\n\u201cRight-wing women have surveyed the world: they find it a dangerous place. They see that work subjects them to more danger from more men; it increases the risk of sexual exploitation. They see that creativity and originality in their kind are ridiculed; they see women thrown out of the circle of male civilization for having ideas, plans, visions, ambitions. They see that traditional marriage means selling to one man, not hundreds: the better deal. They see that the streets are cold, and that the women on them are tired, sick, and bruised. They see that the money they can earn will not make them independent of men and that they will still have to play the sex games of their kind: at home and at work too. They see no way to make their bodies authentically their own and to survive in the world of men. They know too that the Left has nothing better to offer: leftist men also want wives and whores; leftist men value whores too much and wives too little. Right-wing women are not wrong. They fear that the Left, in stressing impersonal sex and promiscuity as values, will make them more vulnerable to male sexual aggression, and that they will be despised for not liking it. They are not wrong. Right-wing women see that within the system in which they live they cannot make their bodies their own, but they can agree to privatized male ownership: keep it one-on-one, as it were. They know that they are valued for their sex\u2014 their sex organs and their reproductive capacity\u2014and so they try to up their value: through cooperation, manipulation, conformity; through displays of affection or attempts at friendship; through submission and obedience; and especially through the use of euphemism\u2014\u201cfemininity, \u201d \u201ctotal woman, \u201d \u201cgood, \u201d \u201cmaternal instinct, \u201d \u201cmotherly love. \u201d Their desperation is quiet; they hide their bruises of body and heart; they dress carefully and have good manners; they suffer, they love God, they follow the rules. They see that intelligence displayed in a woman is a flaw, that intelligence realized in a woman is a crime. They see the world they live in and they are not wrong. They use sex and babies to stay valuable because they need a home, food, clothing. They use the traditional intelligence of the female\u2014animal, not human: they do what they have to survive.\u201d",

She still ended by saying she was voting for Stein because Harris hasn't done anything for the environment and Stein actually cares. \n\nPeople who had Gaza as their main issue and refused to vote for Harris are even more delusional than that.

These figures typically include things like farming subsidies that go to predominantly rural areas, which tend to skew heavily republican, to encourage farmers to invest more in agriculture or subsidies for energy like shale or oil exploration/drilling/refining.  This helps to keep America from being dependent on foreign interests and helps to lower prices nationally, including in blue states.\n\nI am certain there are still gaps, and the cities will always to some extent prop up rural areas, but it's not as clear cut as some articles report it to be.

         "A common sentiment in the comments is \"division is why we are here\".  I want to interrogate that a bit.\n\nThere is a gulf between people.  What is that gulf?  The current assertion is that it is a gap of attainment and sense of purpose, that people feel left behind by modern economic society and want something else - literally anything else - and Trump's republicanism is portrayed as both incredibly shit and also something else.\n\nLet's set aside that Trump is obviously neoliberalism on steroids.  Is that gap to do with civic division? Not really - people across the political spectrum agree that neoliberalism isn't working.  The difference isn't between people doing relatively well and people poorer off, because there is lunatic wealth atop the pyramid on both sides of the division.\n\nBut there is a suggestion that there is something culturally divided between those on each side.  Except it's hard to say that this gap is not itself one of consumer culture.  Do you watch Joe Rogan and Andrew Tate and Fox, or alternatively the many Christian cultural bubbles?\n\nThere is clearly a gap here, because this media simply doesn't appeal to people who lean left, and there's a similar repulsion of people in left-leaning media towards people who lean right.  Our media consumption has split into streams - there is liberal and there is conservative, and what people consider \"balanced\" seems to be viewed as either suspicious, boring or \"inaccessible\".\n\nThis in itself need not necessarily be a problem.  However, what you find with a lot of modern media and consumption in general is that we started somewhere to introduce the idea of \"Community\".  You are the \"Joe Rogan Community\", the \"Magic the Gathering community\", the \"Walmart Employee Community\".  Participation in a particular consumable thing becomes a site of collective organisation as a marketing tool, brands now become part of individual identities, and consumption culture is key to the curation of the self.\n\nDivision is not why we are here.  \"Communities\" are why we are here.  People have begun not to divide themselves from each other but to seek more active bonds with other people that share their views and watching preferences, and this isn't something that comes from the desire to separate but a desire to closer connect.\n\nI believe this is the key argument against the \"we have to stick together\" case to reject reconfiguring the state.  People do not really abstractly work like that any more - they pin their identities and being to their beliefs, their consumption, their media, much more than they do towards the people around them.  It is in fact much more likely to successfully establish a liberal constitution at a more local level to work with this fact of modern human psychology, because people can buy in or sell out as they like.\n\nThis is, after all, what capitalism has trained them to be.",

         "In all seriousness I'm not asking for the US to break up, but I am always going to push back on the ridiculous american and western chauvinism that so many feminists haven't killed in themselves yet. I also do know US history, especially post WWII history, pretty well so I'm gonna provide a bit of context as to why I don't agree.\n\nI mean not for nothing post WWII we're talking supporting dictators all over the global south. Millions dead. Women and girls sexually assaulted constantly in Vietnam, for instance. The genocide in Argentina, all the shit in Afghanistan and Iraq over the decades, the radicalization of a lot of Arab counter-revolutionaries to fight the Soviets in Afghanistan, etc etc etc. Brutalizing Cuba with an embargo for no good reason. \n\nWe weren't just doing fuck shit in Latin America in the 60s and 70s, you have to go back to the late 1800s to see the beginnings of US imperialism in Latin America. Banana republic the term was coined in 1904. The crap we did later on, the coups and support of genocides and dictators, was largely us trying to maintain hegemony in the region when anti-colonial movements arose.\n\nWe allowed trade to flow through the Suez Canal by supporting ethnic cleansing and occupation of the Palestinians. Did it stabilize life for US? Yes, life for those of us in the global north is stable largely because of our dominance abroad. I don't value my comfort over the lives of everyone else though.\n\nWe have famously destabilized much of the global south.  I think a lot of the problem is that as Americans we really do not know our own history, and that's a problem if we are going to talk about how good a stabilizing force we are. \n\nAs far as Russia and China go, yeah they've got their fuck shit too. A friend of mine is Ukrainian and it pains me every day to see what Russia has done to her people, as well as the indigenous Crimean Tatars and other groups. I am more educated on Russian imperialism than I am Chinese imperialism and neo-colonialism. Also I'm an American so I am complicit in the brutality of my country whereas obviously Russian and Chinese people have their own culpabilities wrt their governments' aggressions and crimes against humanity.\n\nI'm also a Marxist feminist so I'm never going to support any of these capitalist hegemonic powers. All of these things and so many others harm women and children, and as a feminist I cannot accept that.",
         "Maybe I wasn't clear. I'll restate the sentence: american hegemony is not why the world is more peaceful now than it ever has been before. It's also really not super clear if it's true or accurate that the world IS more peaceful now than ever before, but rather that there are likely fewer deaths from war due to technology development, the UN and international law mostly being followed SORT OF PERHAPS. I imagine that as time has gone on, the technological developments of war have allowed for countries to do violence without experiencing it as much as they used to (see: drone strikes and bombings as opposed to ye olden battlefields with horses and swords and shit). But that doesn't mean they aren't brutal, and that people don't experience great cruelty in war still.\n\nI think it's actually possible that we will see an increase in conflict deaths and genocide due to climate change, for instance.\n\nHowever even the researchers who conduct these studies have said that it is hard to say for sure if it is accurate - here's the lead researcher, Brennen Fagan, PhD: \n\n\"Data on war deaths will never be perfect. Firstly, it is difficult to know which deaths to include in the data set as many deaths are often brought about indirectly from war -- such as famine or outbreaks of disease. For example, should deaths from Spanish Influenza be counted in the total number of deaths from the First World War?\n\n\"We also acknowledge that the data is likely to be Eurocentric, with the possibility that many deaths incurred by conflicts in the developing world have not been included.\n\n\"While it has its shortcomings, our analysis provides a methodology for future investigations and an empirical basis for political and historical discussions.\"\n\nhttps://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/06/200616113913.htm",

      "text": "Dear Mom,\n\nWhen I was a little girl, you told me how historic it was for women to get the right to have a bank account and credit card in the 1970s. You were a young woman, just starting out in the adult world, and you had hope for equality.\n\nIn 2nd grade, for career day at school we were asked to dress up as what we wanted to be when we grew up. I said I wanted to be a teacher like you and grandma. You sat me down and explained how you didn't have many options for a career, and you were fortunate to go to college at all. You said I had so many options you didn't, and I better not waste them. I promised I wouldn't be a teacher. \n\nAfter you separated from my father, I watched you run the household all by yourself. You mowed the lawn, fixed the toilet, painted the house. You told me men will let you down and I needed to know how to do things myself. \n\nI moved away for college and grew into a successful independent woman. I did not repeat the mistakes you warned me about, with my career or my relationships. I carried those lessons with me. You were proud.\n\nYet today, I am so deeply disappointed in you and the million women like you. How did you raise me to be a feminist and then fail to be one yourself? What made you choose a rapist and conman who will hurt my future and the future of your granddaughters?\n\nYour father fought the nazis in north Africa. Your grandmother you never met was in a camp in Vichy France. The horrors of facism are not some distant history. It's our family's history, and so many other American families too. How can you be on the side of people who wave swastika flags?\n\nI thought you were better than this. I thought our country was better than this. I feel absolutely sick to be so wrong. And now I don't know how to speak to you again. \n\nSincerely,\n\nYour Daughter",

That includes this election too. For example - something like Trump should have never even been a candidate at all, regardless of who is willing to vote for him). \n\nhttps://redsails.org/the-pitfalls-of-liberalism/ (to understand why neoliberals are historically and systemically complicit in that violence).\n\n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1884/origin-family/\n(Works of Frederick Engels 1884, The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State, to understand how patriarchy, birth, capitalism and abortions are connected). \n\nBasically, the institution of patriarchal family required, as its foundation, the dominance of the man over the woman and the confinement of all property relations within the family / to secure property inheritance within male lineage. As a result, women were confined to roles of childbearing and household labor, making them \"means of production and reproduction\" to sustain family wealth. This structure arose from the value placed on private property and inheritance, creating social control over women\u2019s labor and reproduction. Capitalism later built on this setup, relying on women\u2019s unpaid domestic labor to maintain a steady workforce, reinforcing male dominance and the exploitation of women to sustain the economic system.\n\n\nIn addition:\n\n1) Read leftist theory. Political education IS important to truly grasp what is happening in your society & why and why it obviously affects you and your rights and so on. \n\n2) Join leftist orgs, in particular marxist feminist orgs in your community, if you have none, start forming them! Endless of women who could never rely on the US settler state and its laws  to protect them or aid them, had to rely through history on mutual aid, being part of a community that shows up for eachother and so on. (That includes underground movements). \n\n(Note: I wanted to make a radical marxist feminist platform on discord, meaning anti western imperial, capitalist and choice feminist nonsense - that does not center straight cis men - anyone is interested, hit me up via PM). \n\n3) Organized protests. No, not holding signs and bs - organized worker protests with demands. You will have to connect across your country, decide on the demands you have and walk out. Walk out of your jobs, your roles as mothers, grandmothers, workers. You all have been the shit pacified while not acknowledging that your BIGGEST weapon is the fact that you make half of your society and if you refuse to do labor for a certain period of time - your society is gonna shake. They rely on your free labor, your physical labor, all of it. \n\n4) Divest from men, build and nurture solidarity and community with other women. Think \"xyz dude is cute\", does he give a fuck about your rights? Does he give a fuck about systemic oppression, history and so on? No? Move on. Stop putting your energy into relationships with men who do not even care for your basic human rights. \n\n5) Divest from sex in any form that can get you pregnant. There are endless of other ways to get off. Maybe that will motivate some of the men in your life to actually give a fck? Probably not hmm. Eitherway, less chances to get pregnant. \n\n6) If that is not a sacrifice you want to bring for more safety and you still want to take more risks, copper IUD, hormonal IUD, hormonal implant, tied tubes & expecting the men in your life to step tf up! Keep in mind that even after vasectomies it might not be safe for months & there needs to be a frequent visits to make sure sperm count is in order (plus still use condoms in addition to make sure you are safe). Never center short term convenience and pleasure over your physical safety in a society that will treat you as an incubator and is more than willing to see you dead.\n\n7) Pregnancy strike. I am not sure how any woman is still willing to pop babies... but those ideologies and rules are not only for women who don't want kids. If you want kids you are not automatically \"safe\". It could still get you killed. Consider that. \n\n8) Do not automatically trust your family, partner or doctors or anyone, if you deal with unwanted pregnancy. \n\n9) Don't leave any traces or records online those track your period & could potentially be used to incriminate you.\n\n10) Consider moving to another country if it is something you can afford. \n\n11) Have an emergency fund if that is something you can afford.\n\n12) Train & arm yourself.\n\n13) if you were contemplating divorce - go for it now.",

         "Ahh, but it's the same as abortion, it's one that can be enforced at leisure, if you're one of the \"in\" crowd, it's acceptable. If you're not it's illegal.\n\n\nAnd same as the other items, the goal is to increase pregnancy, and unfortunately, thanks to the reason why abortion is bad letters, we know the republicans are of the opinion that it should be teenagers.\n\n\nThe violent urges are, based on the leniency and downplaying of rape convictions, also deemed acceptable in the real world. So not having an alternative isn't deemed an issue.",

That\u2019s not to say that I\u2019m not in full support, I am and I think any action women want to take right now that gives them some semblance of their power and a sense of safety back is absolutely worthwhile.

That just feeds into their entitlement and justifies their atrocities.  \"Hey, they love being beaten because they keep coming back for more.\"\n\nUntil guys learn that being crappy human beings means they're going to be lonely, they're not going to change.\n\nAs for Trump getting a higher share of the White women vote, I'm not sure it's because more women voted for Trump so much as fewer women voted for Harris.  Despite record early ballot mail-ins, the actual number of ballots cast in the election was lower than 2020, which is strange IMO since a lot of people were saying that there were record numbers of people at the polls on election day as well.  I can't find hard numbers on the drop in ballots cast, but it sounds like far more Dems decided not to vote than Republicans.  That skews the statistics.\n\nTo simplify things, let's pretend the country is evenly split between Harris voters vs. Trump voters.  If everyone shows up, out of every 100 votes it's 50 votes for Harris, 50 votes for Trump, so 50% vs. 50%.  If 20 Harris voters don't vote and 10 Trump voters don't vote, it's 30 votes for Harris and 40 votes for Trump.  Out of the 70 votes cast, 42.8% are for Harris and 57.2% are for Trump.  That makes it look like Trump picked up a lot of votes/support when the reality is he simply didn't have as many people no-show.

She ended up with Biden which went well but as far as a singular campaigner for President, had there been time for a proper a primary election where there was a vote on the presidential candidate - I strongly suspect she would have failed in that endeavour, too. She is deeply unpopular in some ways due to backflipping on things she said earlier in her career during her time as a prosecutor.     So you have the fact that plenty of people would have not voted for her because they didn\u2019t get the chance to say yes or no in the Primaries.  \n\nShe was the ONLY choice they had, so they threw everything at her campaign without enough time to curate and formulate it to appeal to as broad a cross section as possible. \n\nI was back home seeing family during the bulk of the time of her campaign so I didn\u2019t see all the ads on tv but I looked for a few of her interviews and speeches, and she comes across as well spoken, well educated and IMO a bit out of touch - \u201cI grew up middle class\u201d is meant to make you relatable but at the moment even the middle classes feel like they\u2019re doing worse now than 4 years ago (despite all signs pointing to the economy doing better\u2026 cost of living has risen dramatically in that time and wages haven\u2019t).  There\u2019s also all the celebrity endorsements which is a \u201cboth sides\u201d problem for sure but IMO an already difficult candidate (not just a woman but a woman of colour) being endorsed by wealthy celebrities like Beyonc\u00e9 or Taylor Swift likely had a not-insignificant number of people who loathe them register and vote Trump just to \u201cstick it to the Swifties\u201d \n\nIt shouldn\u2019t be this way, but honestly I think that if they\u2019d held off, found a white dude in his early to mid 50s who was palatable and charismatic, they could have won. The Dems underestimated the fact that there would be a not small number of people who would have voted for any other Democratic nominee that would not vote for a woman of colour. \n\nAnd there is also the not small number of people who didn\u2019t vote because their online and IRL echo chambers told them that she would win in a landslide.

And it's their fault for not having fair primaries and instead choosing Harris who was literally the most unpopular candidate in the 2020's primaries. It's also Kamala's fault for trying to appeal so much to moderate Republicans and middle class suburban white people, who'd never vote for her anyways, instead of actually leaning hard on the reliable Democrat base. Something that Republicans did without being scared of scaring off the moderates. The biggest problem with the elections is that the Republicans were determined and showed up, while Kamala failed to motivate the Democrats with actually inspiring policy. Instead she run a campaign on strong borders, lethal military, loyalty to the police, and being pro small business.

      "title": "Tips for getting sterilized from someone that did it at 25",
      "text": "First off, here is the list of OBGYNs that have shown they are willing to sterilize young people with or without kids. This list is not exhaustive but a good resource. My doctor is not on this list. \n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Djia_WkrVO3S4jKn6odNwQk7pOcpcL4x00FMNekrb7Q/edit?resourcekey=&gid=1318374028#gid=1318374028\n\n\n1) Do not be afraid to switch doctors. I go to a large practice with several doctors. I really disliked my OBGYN for multiple reasons and had been wanting to switch to a different one for a while and also knew she would never do the surgery. I spoke with my NP at the practice who I love and she helped me switch to a doctor at the practice that she was pretty confident would do the surgery.\n\n\n2) so important: ASK FOR THE SURGERY EVERY TIME YOU INTERACT WITH THE OFFICE EVEN IF YOU KNOW THEY WILL SAY NO. This is the only reason I was able to get my surgery. When I switched to my now doctor, our first every appt together we did my surgery consult and at the end she said \"ok we will get you scheduled. I normally would make patients wait a year but I see in your chart you have been asking for this every appointment since you started coming here at 18\". If your appointments are a couple months out I would even call the office every 2 months or so and just say \"I would like a note added to my chart that I am calling on X day reiterating my decision and request to be sterilized\". MAKE SURE THEY ARE PUTTING YOUR REQUESTS IN YOUR CHART. YOU NEED THIS PAPER TRAIL.\n\n\n3) Know your reasons/come up with reasons you are willing to share but do not share them unless asked. For example, one of my 100s of reasons is climate change but that is kind of controversial so I didnt share that. I just reiterated my firm decision that I am sure I dont want children. During the consult my doctor said something like \"ok I just want to make sure I know why you are choosing this and its not like climate change fears or something external\". So play your cards close to the chest but know you will have to give firm reasons so have them ready. If you seem like you are coming up with answers on the spot, that may hurt you. They need to know you have thought hard about this for a long time.\n\n\n4) Time it right! As stated before I had been asking for years but I put all my energy into this post Dobbs and made sure it was completed before I turned 26 so that my parents insurances covered it. Given the ACA is likely about to be gone, do not wait on this if this is an option for you.  ended up having to pay ZERO for my surgery.\n\n\n5) do not be scared of the surgery. probably preaching to the choir here but the surgery is the easiest medical procedure i have ever done. recovery pain was almost no existent. my scars are tiny/basically non existent. the surgery also actually helps reduce your risk for ovarian cancer which is a huge bonus.\n\n\n6) dont tell people that dont need to know, at least until those tubes are out. you dont need anyone gumming up the works, causing issues. now that they are out, i tell everyone. \n\n\n7) last funny tip, they probably wont let you keep your tubes afterward but it doesnt hurt to ask. mine were sent off to be tested for cancer but I really wanted to keep them in a jar on my shelf lol\n\n\nIm almost 28 now and I do not regret the surgery at all. I love my doctor and Im so glad she did this for me. \n\n\nplease share any tips you have in the comments.",

And I had the surgery scheduled days later. \n\nThese institutions still have a eugenicist underbelly. Tickle it to get what you need. I had endometriosis growths on my lungs and have zero regrets using my disabilities this way.\n\nWhile it's in my chart and have official diagnostic papers for both, they didn't ask for additional confirmation of my disorders.",

I encourage you to read project 2025 \n\nHere is just a small amount of what is in project 2025. We can expect a national abortion ban. Ban health care for women to keep from dying, even ban birth control and condoms. D&C's used to save women's lives when they are dying from miscarriage banned. Pills for abortion or saving lives during miscarriage are banned. Tracking when women travel. And that's only the part of women's health.  They also want to get rid of women's ability to vote. There is so much more in Project 2025. \n\nTrump literally said he wants to ban all vaccines. So many people are going to be affected. And he wants a dictatorship. He doesn't want to leave after 4 years. This might quite literally be the last American president we have, and he has every single branch of government to pull it off.

The Democrats were *sure* she was going to win in 2016. Why? She didn\u2019t. They were *sure* Harris was going to win this time. She didn\u2019t. How can they be this oblivious? \n\nThey botched this whole 2024 process (or lack thereof) with someone who was the first to drop out in 2020. And so, in every single metric, Harris did worse than Hillary Clinton. \n\nAnd the Democrats had a good message over the summer, about the economy, but dropped it to focus on things that are misunderstood or are abstractions to most voters. \"Fascism\" and \"democracy on the ballot.\" While most voters are saying, \"why are eggs so expensive?\" Harris dropped all that good summer stuff about affordable rent, college, gas and power bills, corporate responsibility, minimum wage. Just poof. Exit polls in swing states showed that Biden had a 60% disapproval rate there. Harris did nothing to distance herself from him or his record (even for political reasons).\n\nThe Democratic Party thinks it's a majority party, but it's not. America is high school. The Democrats are the theater kids, the AV club, the chess team, debate team, the kids taking AP classes, Tracy Flick and Mark Ratner. The Republican (voters) are the kids taking regular classes, playing sports, fixing cars, having keggers, Stacy and Brad Hamilton. The \"regular kids\" aren't going to follow the theater kids, unless someone comes along with super charisma like Bill Clinton or Obama. *And* speaks about the economy. \n\nIt's always the economy. People throw names around like \"socialist\" and \"fascist\" but it's always the economy. Trump supporters, 49% said that the economy was their #1 issue. For Harris voters it was 12%. Almost everyone who was worried about the economy voted for Trump. Because nobody knew who Harris was or what she was going to do (a) differently than Biden, and (b) to help.\n\nAbortion is incredibly important, but it's not something that most Americans (including, we discovered, most women) care about enough to swing things. Abortion is a \"tomorrow problem\" for voters. Maybe it'll be a problem for them in the future. The economy is a problem for them now.\n\nThis was so botched.

Instead of dancing around the topic, I think I\u2019ll just cut to it; one of the few issues that Kamala made a clear stance on was abortion, this is a very odd hill to take a stance on, in my opinion. It\u2019s being talked about like it\u2019s the only option. It sounds like people think the only branches on this decision tree are giving birth or abortion. No one is talking about abstinence, birth control, or contraception; the literal ABCs of safe sex. Are there cases where these aren\u2019t options? Of course. Do I think there is a place for abortion? Yes. No woman should have to fee they have to die to give birth in the instance of a problematic birth and no woman should be forced to birth the child of a rapist\u2026FURTHER contributing to the physical and psychological trauma they have endured. But I feel that instead of a stance of abortion, a much more communal topic to rally behind should be free birth control options or free feminine hygiene products to negate, what fees like, a gender tax.",

This poses as a major vulnerability, particularly for those at risk of criminalization for seeking an abortion.\n\nBefore *Roe v Wade* was even overturned, Dr. Randall Williams, former Missouri state health director, tracked the menstrual cycles of women who visited Planned Parenthood, which was used to identify individuals who might have had abortions following failed termination procedures. To clarify, this doctor holds anti-abortion views.\n\nSource: [*Should you worry about data from your period-tracking app being used against you?*](https://www.politifact.com/article/2022/may/12/ask-khn-politifact-should-you-worry-about-data-you/)\n\nThe former director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, Scott Lloyd, took a disturbing approach by tracking menstrual cycles for potential criminal prosecutions and, in at least one instance, for experimentation:\n\n>Lloyd has\u00a0admitted\u00a0to pressuring these young women to keep their pregnancies. Seemingly, he was quite strenuous in his insistence. In one email, Lloyd relates that a pregnant woman in his care who was seeking\u2014and being kept from having\u2014an abortion mentioned suicide. In response to that,\u00a0he writes: \u201cThe clinician describes her demeanor as 'obnoxious' and that 'the unborn child is in our care so the medical team should continue with standard prenatal care.'\" If she continued to want an abortion after \u201cspiritual counseling,\u201d Lloyd continues, she\u2019d have to obtain parental consent.\n\nSource: [*The U.S. Is Tracking Migrant Girls' Periods to Stop Them From Getting Abortions*](https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/politics/a26985261/trump-administration-abortion-period-tracking-migrant-women/)\n\nExperts are concerned.

It is difficult to get most people to care about other issues if they are struggling to pay the bills. Regardless of who has the best plan and whos fault it is, and how bad tarrifs might be (people dont understand tariffs) Kamala is too close to Biden to not get the blame on this one from the common voter. Immigration is the second which plays into the economy as people see oh we are paying x amount per immigrant and i see them on every corner and i am struggling to pay the rent and now my taxes are going up. The third most important is of course abortion. It will be #1 among this sub and #1 among women but the issue is i think it's harder to get the voters from older non child bearing women even many mothers, as well as men of course even fathers and especially not young men. \n\nSo ultimately in short it's just people cared about the economy more that they did abortion, not because it's a more important issue, but it just effects more people so it will be a larger voting issue for them.",

         "I will repost this (you can quote me and repost it too if you want) cause women in the US really need to grasp they can't just cherry pick which violence of the US settler state they embrace - eventually it is gonna come for them one way or another. \n\nRegardless of who wins, I actually truly hope that if none of the other violence the US settler state causes makes a lot of you reflect on your \"electoral politics\" - this shit right here will make you angry enough to not want to entertain something like it again & also understand that no matter what political theater your society pulls, you cant just \"outvote\" the racist and fascist nature of your society. \n\nhttps://www.indigenousaction.org/voting-is-not-harm-reduction-an-indigenous-perspective/\n\nhttps://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/coordination-of-anarchist-groups-against-democracy (to understand why neoliberals in the West acting like electoral politics for the status quo, are not the \"freedom\" and fair process most of you all think it is. That includes this election too. For example - something like Trump should have never even been a candidate at all, regardless of who is willing to vote for him). \n\nhttps://redsails.org/the-pitfalls-of-liberalism/ (to understand why neoliberals are historically and systemically complicit in that violence).\n\n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1884/origin-family/\n(Works of Frederick Engels 1884, The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State, to understand how patriarchy, birth, capitalism and abortions are connected). \n\nBasically, the institution of patriarchal family required, as its foundation, the dominance of the man over the woman and the confinement of all property relations within the family / to secure property inheritance within male lineage. As a result, women were confined to roles of childbearing and household labor, making them \"means of production and reproduction\" to sustain family wealth. This structure arose from the value placed on private property and inheritance, creating social control over women\u2019s labor and reproduction. Capitalism later built on this setup, relying on women\u2019s unpaid domestic labor to maintain a steady workforce, reinforcing male dominance and the exploitation of women to sustain the economic system.\n\n\nIn addition:\n\n1) Read leftist theory. Political education IS important to truly grasp what is happening in your society & why and why it obviously affects you and your rights and so on. \n\n2) Join leftist orgs, in particular marxist feminist orgs in your community, if you have none, start forming them! Endless of women who could never rely on the US settler state and its laws  to protect them or aid them, had to rely through history on mutual aid, being part of a community that shows up for eachother and so on. (That includes underground movements). \n\n(Note: I wanted to make a radical marxist feminist platform on discord, meaning anti western imperial, capitalist and choice feminist nonsense - that does not center straight cis men - anyone is interested, hit me up via PM). \n\n3) Organized protests. No, not holding signs and bs - organized worker protests with demands. You will have to connect across your country, decide on the demands you have and walk out. Walk out of your jobs, your roles as mothers, grandmothers, workers. You all have been the shit pacified while not acknowledging that your BIGGEST weapon is the fact that you make half of your society and if you refuse to do labor for a certain period of time - your society is gonna shake. They rely on your free labor, your physical labor, all of it. \n\n4) Divest from men, build and nurture solidarity and community with other women. Think \"xyz dude is cute\", does he give a fuck about your rights? Does he give a fuck about systemic oppression, history and so on? No? Move on. Stop putting your energy into relationships with men who do not even care for your basic human rights. \n\n5) Divest from sex in any form that can get you pregnant. There are endless of other ways to get off. Maybe that will motivate some of the men in your life to actually give a fck? Probably not hmm. Eitherway, less chances to get pregnant. \n\n6) If that is not a sacrifice you want to bring for more safety and you still want to take more risks, copper IUD, hormonal IUD, hormonal implant, tied tubes & expecting the men in your life to step tf up! Keep in mind that even after vasectomies it might not be safe for months & there needs to be a frequent visits to make sure sperm count is in order (plus still use condoms in addition to make sure you are safe). Never center short term convenience and pleasure over your physical safety in a society that will treat you as an incubator and is more than willing to see you dead.\n\n7) Pregnancy strike. I am not sure how any woman is still willing to pop babies... but those ideologies and rules are not only for women who don't want kids. If you want kids you are not automatically \"safe\". It could still get you killed. Consider that. \n\n8) Do not automatically trust your family, partner or doctors or anyone, if you deal with unwanted pregnancy. \n\n9) Don't leave any traces or records online those track your period & could potentially be used to incriminate you.\n\n10) Consider moving to another country if it is something you can afford. \n\n11) Have an emergency fund if that is something you can afford.\n\n12) Train & arm yourself.\n\n13) if you were contemplating divorce - go for it now",

         "I will repost this (you can quote me and repost it too if you want) cause women in the US really need to grasp they can't just cherry pick which violence of the US settler state they embrace - eventually it is gonna come for them one way or another. \n\nRegardless of who wins, I actually truly hope that if none of the other violence the US settler state causes makes a lot of you reflect on your \"electoral politics\" - this shit right here will make you angry enough to not want to entertain something like it again & also understand that no matter what political theater your society pulls, you cant just \"outvote\" the racist and fascist nature of your society. \n\nhttps://www.indigenousaction.org/voting-is-not-harm-reduction-an-indigenous-perspective/\n\nhttps://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/coordination-of-anarchist-groups-against-democracy (to understand why neoliberals in the West acting like electoral politics for the status quo, are not the \"freedom\" and fair process most of you all think it is. That includes this election too. For example - something like Trump should have never even been a candidate at all, regardless of who is willing to vote for him). \n\nhttps://redsails.org/the-pitfalls-of-liberalism/ (to understand why neoliberals are historically and systemically complicit in that violence).\n\n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1884/origin-family/\n(Works of Frederick Engels 1884, The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State, to understand how patriarchy, birth, capitalism and abortions are connected). \n\nBasically, the institution of patriarchal family required, as its foundation, the dominance of the man over the woman and the confinement of all property relations within the family / to secure property inheritance within male lineage. As a result, women were confined to roles of childbearing and household labor, making them \"means of production and reproduction\" to sustain family wealth. This structure arose from the value placed on private property and inheritance, creating social control over women\u2019s labor and reproduction. Capitalism later built on this setup, relying on women\u2019s unpaid domestic labor to maintain a steady workforce, reinforcing male dominance and the exploitation of women to sustain the economic system.\n\n\nIn addition:\n\n1) Read leftist theory. Political education IS important to truly grasp what is happening in your society & why and why it obviously affects you and your rights and so on. \n\n2) Join leftist orgs, in particular marxist feminist orgs in your community, if you have none, start forming them! Endless of women who could never rely on the US settler state and its laws  to protect them or aid them, had to rely through history on mutual aid, being part of a community that shows up for eachother and so on. (That includes underground movements). \n\n(Note: I wanted to make a radical marxist feminist platform on discord, meaning anti western imperial, capitalist and choice feminist nonsense - that does not center straight cis men - anyone is interested, hit me up via PM). \n\n3) Organized protests. No, not holding signs and bs - organized worker protests with demands. You will have to connect across your country, decide on the demands you have and walk out. Walk out of your jobs, your roles as mothers, grandmothers, workers. You all have been the shit pacified while not acknowledging that your BIGGEST weapon is the fact that you make half of your society and if you refuse to do labor for a certain period of time - your society is gonna shake. They rely on your free labor, your physical labor, all of it. \n\n4) Divest from men, build and nurture solidarity and community with other women. Think \"xyz dude is cute\", does he give a fuck about your rights? Does he give a fuck about systemic oppression, history and so on? No? Move on. Stop putting your energy into relationships with men who do not even care for your basic human rights. \n\n5) Divest from sex in any form that can get you pregnant. There are endless of other ways to get off. Maybe that will motivate some of the men in your life to actually give a fck? Probably not hmm. Eitherway, less chances to get pregnant. \n\n6) If that is not a sacrifice you want to bring for more safety and you still want to take more risks, copper IUD, hormonal IUD, hormonal implant, tied tubes & expecting the men in your life to step tf up! Keep in mind that even after vasectomies it might not be safe for months & there needs to be a frequent visits to make sure sperm count is in order (plus still use condoms in addition to make sure you are safe). Never center short term convenience and pleasure over your physical safety in a society that will treat you as an incubator and is more than willing to see you dead.\n\n7) Pregnancy strike. I am not sure how any woman is still willing to pop babies... but those ideologies and rules are not only for women who don't want kids. If you want kids you are not automatically \"safe\". It could still get you killed. Consider that. \n\n8) Do not automatically trust your family, partner or doctors or anyone, if you deal with unwanted pregnancy. \n\n9) Don't leave any traces or records online those track your period & could potentially be used to incriminate you.\n\n10) Consider moving to another country if it is something you can afford. \n\n11) Have an emergency fund if that is something you can afford.\n\n12) Train & arm yourself.\n\n13) if you were contemplating divorce - go for it now",

My point is that sexuality is personal and human and important and it's 1) unreasonable to demand that all women go on \"sex strike\" and 2) the idea of a \"sex strike\" carries some implications that imo are pretty misogynist and backwards and that echo the lies incels/religious conservatives believe about women, our sexuality, and our role in relationships.\n\nTake care of yourself <3",

I care about our side and what the idea of a sex ban implies for women.\n\nI'm saying that expecting women to \"withhold sex\" assumes that sex \u2014 and romantic love, more importantly \u2014 is something most of can and should be expected to cut out of our lives. To me, this idea echoes the sexist thought you see in conservative religious and incel spaces that women have this cool detachment from sex \u2014 that we aren't sexual creatures  like men are, that we can just decide to be \"\"\"pure\"\"\" and celibate without losing something important about ourselves and our humanity. That sex isn't a part of our humanity. Sex isn't just about fun. It is about love. And love is part of our humanity. \n\nPersonally, I can't give that up.  I can't give up love, and I won't. I love my partner, he loves me. He's as torn up \u2014\u00a0if not more \u2014\u00a0about what's happening than I am. He isn't the problem. A lot of individual men aren't the problem. I have a lot of rage at men as a class, but I don't hate the individual men I know who are good allies now just because they're men.\n\nDo I think women should be in partnerships with men who don't respect their humanity and who vote and act against their rights? Absolutely not. Do I think women should consider very carefully who they get into relationships with and effecitvely trust with their lives? Yes. I just find the idea of a blanket ban on heterosexuality pretty ridiculous.  \n\nI definitely have empathy. I wouldn't have kids in the US right now. But I understand that some women will still choose to risk their lives having kids *because the risk is personally worth it to them \u2014* and yes, some women already willingly do this already, i.e. people choosing to go forward with risky multiples pregnancies and other high-risk pregnancies.

Giving myself a day from my task list, stayed in bed a little longer, ate that last bit of ice cream, having that beer. Going to read a new book I got here soon. Self-care. \n\nAnd now that the work day is done, tearing up, too.

I used to dream of moving to America. My own country is regressing in a similar way and progressives barely scraped by in the last election and not without having to form a coalition with the very villains that we all came out in force to vote and overthrow.

To my surprise, he voted for Kamala and my other uncles didn't. He apparently read them the riot act and they got very pissed off. He was crying on the phone to me, and he said that he doesn't think he can believe in God anymore.\n\nWhen he's a voice of reason in my family, I don't know what to fucking think.",
         "Understood. It's new and raw. Women around the world are concerned for you, because your troubles are, or soon could be, ours too. Personally, I wanted to slap our Prime Minister when he was one of the first to congratulate Trump! That aside, I'm old now, and remember when women had fewer rights than farm animals. We survived and thrived. We're still doing it.

If Trump's people behind the scenes have their way, everything the women fought for and died for will be gone. Abortion is the easiest. They couched voting rights with the term Women's Suffrage. There was a show called \"The Man Show\" years ago. They did an episode on getting women to sign a petition to end Women's Suffrage. Women were signing it in droves because they wanted women to stop suffering. Eventually a man stood there trying to tell these idiots that they were signing away their right to vote.

Once their laws are on the books, and Trump will have at least 2 years of the Republicans being in resounding control, it will be near impossible to get them overturned with the current Supreme Court. Congress isn't know for upending enacted laws. They rely on the SC to fix that issue.

And anyone who voted for him for economic reasons is either an idiot or a liar, as his proposed tariff laws will screw over average Americans. His presidency will only benefit the rich. \n\nThe problem though is that the Democrats refuse to take a stance on what's happening in Gaza, including Kamala, and it's not like she hasn't been in office for 4 years. You can argue that vice-presidents have barely any power, but that doesn't change the fact she comes from a very unpopular administration, and that Biden has pretty much failed on all his promises that secured him the leftist vote. As much as I wish that all leftists voted for Kamala anyway, I can't really say I don't understand people that refused to vote for her.

         "It continues to become more and more clear that women in America will never be seen as equal to men. Not equal enough to make laws about our own bodies. Not equal enough to be in the executive leadership office.

I thought women dying from being unable to access healthcare changed people\u2019s minds. And Harris was such a promising candidate, with experience and charisma - I thought people would turn out for her and her vision.

I knew it'd be close but I just had a tiny glimmer of hope that MAYBE it would not be like this.\n\nI just don't get it? people are looking at Trump, a convicted felon, a violent instigator of an insurrection, a man who has admitted he'd be a dictator and has threatened political violence on people, an ACTUAL RAPIST, and they're like, \"oh yea I can vote for that!\" Or, they ignore it because \"the economy is bad\" like they haven't been paying enough attention to see that Trump's plans are going to actively harm them?\n\nHOW IS THIS HAPPENING??? How are we here again??? I feel so sorry for us, for us women, for us as a country. We owe ALL those women who have died after not receiving the healthcare they need better. I'm sorry we failed them.",
         "Yes. I mean...I'm so dumbfounded how people are so blind. Trump has made it VERY easy to want to vote against. The things he says, the dumb things he says, all the legal evidence, recorded evidence, the way his followers act, the bullying they use as a political leg to stand on...how how do people see all this and still say...yeah he's better than Harris. If it really comes down to they rather have any man than a woman...then wow...",

IE, polling numbers are showing Trump went from 10% black male voter support, to 25% this election, and if he wins that's the difference.

         "Trump set us so far back with a single term - climate, human (women\u2019s especially) rights, foreign relations, you name it. And in that term, he had a divided Congress, did not yet have a Supreme Court supermajority, and most importantly, did not yet understand the government apparatus, and was surrounded by Republicans who, while I disagreed with them, at least had enough integrity to put country over party and check his worst impulses. \n\nLiterally all of that is gone now. It\u2019s looking like both halves of Congress will be Republican, the Supreme Court remains 6-3, and he\u2019s replaced anyone disagreeing with him with yes men. And plans to displace subject matter experts with his own appointees across all of our regulatory agencies. The guardrails are truly broken. \n\nI honestly don\u2019t know how we come back from this. The damage of the next four years may be irreparable. Democracies like Ukraine and Taiwan in other parts of the world will fall to other strongman types like Xi and Putin. Trump may even help them do it. And what\u2019s left of Gaza will be newly leveled with US dollars funding all of it.

It's hiw a country who keeps crowing about how much they hate criminals and \"soft sentences\" just elected a man who was convinced of 34 felonies to be president, after spending the 2016 campaign shouting \"lock her up\" to Hillary.",

The Democrats messed up.\n\n> The Democratic National Convention in August was roundly acclaimed as a great success, presenting a unified front [\u2026] Over the past few weeks, however, Harris has dropped in the polls, and heading into Election Day, many Democrats feel less than confident.\n\n> What\u2019s going on? A poll of 1,000 Pennsylvania voters from the Center for Working-Class Politics (CWCP), Jacobin, and YouGov shows that the campaign was tentatively heading in the right direction this summer.\n\n> In late August, the historian Eric Foner wrote that Democrats were attempting to make the election about competing definitions of freedom \u2014 about, as Tim Walz said in his acceptance speech, \u201cthe freedom to make a better life for yourself and the people that you love,\u201d against the freedom of corporations \u201cto pollute your air\u201d and banks to \u201ctake advantage of customers.\u201d UAW president Shawn Fain went even further at the national convention in naming and blaming the villains that stand in the way of a better life for working people: \u201cCorporate greed turns blue-collar blood, sweat, and tears into Wall Street stock buybacks and CEO jackpots,\u201d he argued, adding that Trump was a \u201cscab\u201d who would protect the interests of corporations and billionaires. That same month, the campaign announced a series of commitments to tackle the housing shortage, crack down on price gouging, and raise the minimum wage.\n\nOur survey found strong support for this kind of economic populist messaging and widespread antipathy for billionaires and corporate elites, especially among constituencies that Harris has struggled to reach \u2014 union members, voters without a college degree, and blue-collar voters, with whom Harris was trailing by 4, 7, and 19 points respectively in our poll. Despite these clear findings, Harris has pivoted away from anti-elite, economic messaging in the last month of the campaign and backtracked or de-emphasized some of her more popular policies in response to pressure from the business community.\n\n> Democrats have once again decided to place the very risky bet that catering to moderate, college-educated voters will win more support than it loses in working-class defections. Leading up to election day, they\u2019ve put most of their chips on a message that warns voters of the threat posed by a second Trump presidency.

I remember how much I wanted her to win. I remember thinking, \"My GOD, that's something to look up to. That's someone I want to be like!\" \n\nI want little girls and young women to look up to Harris like I looked up to Ferraro and know that this was possible and even though she didn't make it, it wasn't because of her but because of sexism. We need to ban together and fight back. We're stronger together. We're better together. They should not divide us. We cannot afford to let them.",

After seven long years of this, I finally realized it was extraordinary, that this was not how a family was supposed to act, we weren't supposed to be tearing at each others throats all the time and one time when I was serving once more as the family chew toy, I had enough, and demanded to know how she could act so ruthlessly to her own flesh and blood. She couldn't look me in the eye, but just said something to the effect of \"you'll understand when you have kids.\" She, at least in the moment, denied that she had agency and was actively choosing to be abusive and to stay with an abuser. Retrospectively, this is what caused the first major depressive episode of my life.\n\nShe did leave him later that year, one of the happiest moments of my life, and I like to think it was partially my obstinance that gave her the courage to do so, though she's never admitted as much.  I think she's still angry at me because I gave him the benefit of the doubt when I saw him.... humbled for the first time in my life.  I never thought before meeting him for the first time after the divorce that I'd ever feel even the tiniest drop of sympathy for that man, but there he was like a wounded animal, my father being polite, kind and most surprising of all, respectful, to me in a way none of the rest of my family ever once acted towards me, not that it lasted very long, but I had no way of knowing that at 7 years old.\n\n  My mom never forgave me for forgiving him, not even 15 years later at his funeral, she just made some snide remark towards me about him I can't even remember the details of besides the pain of old wounds being callously opened again. It's okay though, I don't know everything he put her through, so I can't exactly judge her.\n\nThinking back though, that feeling you mention about never thinking we'll actually move the needle but refusing to give up, that was the feeling that got me to speak up, and it was the tiny ember that smoldered within me no matter how powerless I felt as a kid.  I am not them, I would not do what you are doing to me at seven years old.  In my darkest moments, when I feel everything is lost, I just whisper to that seven year old little boy, \"don't worry, she's wrong. you'd never be her, you're better than that.\" and it always gives me at least a little bit more strength.",

It's heart breaking how so many can vote and ignore the context of it, or choose not to vote.

Unfortunately it will probably be too late. America is just too big to not have an eventually cataclysmic fall and we are watching it in action.

If anything, it proves we are no different than a large portion of the world. There is no American exceptionalism. We can just as easily slip into fascism like we have seen happen again and again elsewhere.  \n  \nAll I can say is we need to put all of our energy into what we can control. What we have right in front of us. We need to be ready to defend each other and ourselves. For those that can afford to move out of the country, I wish you wouldn't, but that is selfish of me and I totally understand where you are coming from. For those of us that stay by choice or by necessity, we have to watch out for each other. We need to lower our walls for our sisters and try to be the safety we deserve. Now is the time we stop thinking about having families and start thinking about what we can do to help the generations that will have to suffer beyond us.  \n  \nThis may be violence, this may be peace, or this may be somewhere in the middle. We can no longer lie to ourselves that good will prevail at least in the short term. We have to be ready for what is to come and shedding our American idealism for good is the first step and seeing this country for what it really is.

         "Side note: last year my students on the FIRST LEGO League team made talking planters that told you about their water needs for the innovation project. \n\nAs part of this they wanted to give each planter a different personality. \n\nI played them the Cave Johnson video, and so they made a \"Cave Plantson\" planter. I will never forget that they made a judge laugh so hard he fell out of his chair with that.",
         "I agree. The GOP is smarter at playing the game than the Dems",
         "She let her ego ruin her office. It defaced her legacy.",
         "There is nothing to love about someone who let their own ego get in the way of the future of millions of people",
         "I hate RBG. shes selfish. She undid all of the work done in her lifetime by her ego",
         "Honestly I don\u2019t love her anymore. She should have stepped down. All the good she did was undone because of it. \n\nI hope Sotomayor isn\u2019t making the same mistake.",
         "I'll never understand why she didn't retire voluntarily.",
         "And Sotomayor is doing the exact same thing. She should have left as soon as Biden got in.",
         "Yup. Vance is a horrific person, with extreme polices. Project 2024 is reality now.\n\nAnd to tie in Trump's two new picks for the Supreme Court.... this will span at least 30 years. \n\nThis will be a problem and a reality for the rest of my life.",
         "As soon as the clock ticks over which says Vance can run twice more, Trump is dead. (Is my assumption, not a threat).",
         "God isn\u2019t that fucking maddening? I kind of hope she\u2019s rolling in her grave a bit over that decision.",
         "And Trump wants to dismantle the DOE. That will genuinely be the death blow to our country.",
         "Mostly criminally uneducated. I'm from rural Kentucky, and the amount of people who don't realize that higher tariffs means the customer paying MORE is insane. There really needs to be an IQ test before people are allowed to vote. If you have the IQ of a coal dusted rutabaga, your opinion doesn't matter.",
         "My husband is a black man and a feminist and he was really upset by the pundits talking about his demographic voting for trump. I\u2019m a white woman and all I could do was commiserate because a lot of my demographic voted for trump too. Racism and misogyny go hand in hand. I guess everyone fucked around and now we are all about to find out how little we matter to our country.",
         "Nobody believed me when I mentioned this. I'm glad to see others mention it now.\n\nBeen working on the maps to show the evidence. My guess is that it is the statistically significant variable this election (as it was in 2016).\n\nI mean, they used the very same tactics piloted in the gamergate movement (of which Bannon, Yannocopolis and the tech bro influenced/influencer bro dudes were part of).",
         "Underprivileged men simply couldn't allow a woman to win.\n\nI think all the 'vote in secret' ads got under their skin too.",
         "I think the exit polls showed negligible movement in the Black male vote from 2020 and something like a 40% swing in the Latino male vote.",
         "Poor guy has been listening to my podcasts (Visible Women) about all the things women have had to fight for and are still fighting for. He constantly says how stupid men are to be such assholes about absolutely everything.",
         "This is it. My spouse kept saying the same thing - it will be a landslide. And I kept telling him, you don't know how much they hate women. And a woman of color? America says no.",
         "And racism.",
         "And sexism here is really bad too.",
         "Don't rule out stupidity. People were ***told*** that Biden was ruining the economy and that Trump would make it better. It's not true, but we're well into the post-truth era.",
         "You are absolutely right, Gen Z and Latino men carry the weight.\n\nI just mean to say that white women we 51% for Trump, which is a miniature majority.\n\nI don\u2019t mean to shame or call anyone out. There\u2019s more than enough negativity.\n\nUltimately the fact white men are the thing all voters must fight against is the deepest problematic population.\n\nSo it isn\u2019t even about shaming Gen Z or the Latino population either.\u00a0\n\nMen were completely fine with voting for a ticket likely to harm people unlike themselves. And that is shitty, with no way to spin or apologize for it.",
         "That is weirdly convenient I must admit. All indicators were that there would be more participation than in 2020, it the numbers are lower then that needs to be investigated. \n\nI honestly would not put it past them to cheat - after all, that's what they tried last time.",
         "i hate how right you most likely are",
         "i mean, in the grand scheme of things & ESPECIALLY compared to him.",
         "damn, white western women really have solidarity for Gazan women  being eviscerated by their girlboss",
         "I get it. I slept like shit last night.",
         "wow men are weak.",
         "Nearly the country did not vote for her unfortunately. Voter turnout was down for her and a lot of people sat out the election or voted third party. Hell only a little more than half the country votes in the election.",
         "You did nothing wrong. But sadly you live in a country full of bigots, idiots, and people who didn\u2019t care enough. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s fair to those who tried to do the right thing. But the reality is America as a country made a choice and now it\u2019s going to suffer the worst possible outcome.",
         "I think my purpose right now is just on surviving, which is a good enough purpose.",
         "I think it's just the fact that for just how scary Trump is, he and his cronies will still be dealing with the absurdities and ineffectiveness of the US government.",
         "It also killed Roe v Wade. Obama begged her to step down so he could apoint a younger dem judge, but she refused. The \"*great feminist judge*\" set women back decades.",
         "She would have had to retire in the first 2ish years of Obama's presidency, sadly. Republicans spent over a year blocking Obama's Supreme Court picks, and I don't doubt that they would have spent longer if they could have.",
         "Look at the facts, Obama wouldn't get anyone through....he couldn't even get Garland approved by McConnell.",
         "Her legacy had catastrophic consequences for indigenous people, so her ego isn't the only thing that defaced it.",
         "Yup. Completely fd her legacy on the way out the door. I still haven\u2019t forgiven her for that.",
         "Do you think they would have allowed him to appoint a judge? I\u2019m remembering Garland not being approved and then Amy being shoehorned in so fast\u2026",
         "Frankly I hope hell is real just for people like that",
         "And the EPA. Death blow to our planet.",
         ">I'm from rural Kentucky, and the amount of people who don't realize that higher tariffs means the customer paying MORE is insane.\n\nOn the other hand, we've seen over the last 30 years with unchecked globalization what happens with no tariffs - stuff in the shelves might become cheaper but you can't afford it anyway as your employers all left for China, India, Vietnam or whatever wage dumping country is the current hot shit. That devastation for blue-collar jobs is what's fueling the rise of the populists across the Western world.",
         "I agree. There needs to be some kind of civics test that shows that you understand *something* about how our government and economy works. It doesn't need to be hard. I don't care if that's \"classist\". The dumb fucks are ruining our country. Like goodbye 'American bounty' hello 'starving to death in the streets because our majority voter base is uneducated, greedy, and stupid'. All the men worship Putin so fucking much I hope you like it when he sends you to war to die. Good riddance.",
         "My in-laws live across from a couple who have always been hardcore Trumpers. Big ass banner and everything. The man is black and I don't understand how he loves Trump. You're black, you're poor, and you don't have kids so you aren't feeding the capitalist machine. They're on welfare too iirc. Like my brother in christ, he HATES you.",
         "Misogynoir specifically.\u00a0",
         "It\u2019s not sexism if the men says so /s",
         "No. Men voted for him or stayed home. That\u2019s what happened.",
         "I agree its possible. Ballot machines were shipped abroad to be experimented on. Sexism and racism definitely played a strong role, though, in people staying home or voting against our democratic republic.",
         "It seems so",
         "It\u2019s crazy.",
         "Icelandic men probably aren't full-on misogynists like many US men, so it probably worked faster.",
         "Obviously, or they would respect women.",
         "Fair. Thank you for explaining further. Thank you for not also directly lumping me in with those people or telling me that I am to blame. I feel so ashamed to live here. This is depressing.",
         "Yes. We have to! Thank you for reminding me.",
         "Yep. Ego got in the way. She thoroughly mangled her legacy on the way out. As was expected."
