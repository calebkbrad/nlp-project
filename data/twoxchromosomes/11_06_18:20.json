She\u2019s not a happy person and just wants other women to get punished and \u201cface the same consequences\u201d that she did.

So they lost there\u2019s and fuck everyone else. \n\nShe said she didn\u2019t want her kid to go to war.

I see many women who are married to Trump supporters and I just don\u2019t understand it.  They vote for Trump right alongside their husbands.  As a 37 year old male I am very worried about the future.  I can\u2019t even begin to understand how women in this country feel after this horrific event.

I want to blame the men who dreamed this shit up and I will, but I know I will be getting trashed from all sides. It adds a whole other dimension to the depression this is causing. For me there is no \"I got mine\". I am not one of the women in that video where a politician who would never personally produce a baby was baffled that women over 50 would care about a situation they wouldn't be in any more than he would. By that logic, why the hell should he have been so focused on it. \n\nSorry, I am ranting. Just fuck this shit all to hell! The closest I can come to hope at this point is if that orange lard ass dies of a heart attack before inauguration, but that still leaves all those 2025 architects still in place. Just shit.",

If anything, it increased, as there's now no need for contraceptives.\n\n  \nAs for why he won't give you a straight answer, it's likely one of a couple reasons.   \n  \n1. Either he is afraid of getting the operation, in which case, he should understand, should you become pregnant and possibly have to undergo a C-Section, you'd be going through a MUCH WORSE operation that risks your \\[and the babies\\] life. If he can't understand this, there will be no way of convincing him that it is the right choice.\n\n2. The second reason being that maybe he thinks it will make him less of a man; this is a flawed view and ultimately boils down to being insecure with who he is. You've already mentioned that you already have children and can't afford to provide for another, this is logical and a smart choice.\n\n  \nFrom the way it looks, he doesn't view your relationship (and by extension, the family) as important as his view of himself; he is willing to put your Health \\[Both Mental and Physical\\] and the families Financial stability at risk, **for what? To keep the ability to make more children?** Again, if his main concern is his own safety during the operation then he clearly doesn't view your safety the same way (Referring to Reason #1)\n\n  \nI think he needs to be honest with himself and with you, about why it isn't a priority. **There is no shame in being open and honest about how you feel, most men feel like it is** ***unmanly*** **to open up, yet it can strengthen the relationship.**",

We can have empathy too. Even if it seems ridiculous. I don't know, after seeing him hopeless and in pain all the time, I regret being so callous and dismissive about the whole thing. But that's just me.",

Wouldn't we want partners to give a shit that we have concerns and listen and consider them? It's literally a reoccurring theme here and in life when talking to other women.\n\nGood relationships involve talking to each other about things, especially important things.\n\nHow the conversation goes and what is said would determine if it's parenting or not imo. But in a healthy relationship it should be entirely acceptable and normal to discuss it so both people understand thought processes and can express their thoughts and both know what will happen going forward.\n\nI would want to know why he changed his mind and would ask.",

         "I didn\u2019t cause anything more than she did. We had no plan for me to get vasectomy at that point. It was an eventual AFTER another child or adoption.

We'll have you out in no time.\"\n\nI don't regret it, but I would have liked to know of the potential complications.",

Some recent studies even suggest that age is not as much a factor for reversal than originally believed. From what I understand, it depends on the type of vasectomy that was performed. Microsurgical technology has also come really far so studies and data that are decades old that talked about are believed to no longer be as relevant. Since the pool of men who actually desire a reversal is quite small (I believe 5-6% or less), from what I understand, there is not enough data and published literature on this.\n\nAll that being said, I'm not a doctor so definitely don't know all the detail.

We have feelings too. Where's the room for her feelings there? She can't have any, she has to parent her partner to get him to follow through on his promises. How is that a partnership?",

So in this case he should say as much. But he hasn't said why so if OP wants to know they will have to talk to him and decide how to proceed.\n\nHaving a conversation doesn't mean you can't have your own thoughts and feelings and time to process. I also never said anyone had to do it. I asked how it's parenting because in a healthy relationship it would be communicating. I also didn't say she should be asking with the aim of getting him to actually do it. It's highly unlikely. She needs to make her own decisions.",

Trump can\u2019t just snap his fingers and make global inflation vanish. In fact, our economy was already performing relatively well, especially compared to much of the world. But don\u2019t expect that to last - people like Musk are already hinting at rough times ahead, which likely means they\u2019ll skew the economy to favor corporations while pretending it\u2019s all a necessary struggle for the \u201cgreater good.\u201d\n\nSecond, Trump will accomplish next to nothing in his first two years and likely his entire term. With a narrow Senate majority, Republicans would need 60 votes to push through controversial legislation under current filibuster rules - not even all Republicans would back his extreme agenda, let alone 8 Democrats. Sure, Senate leadership could try lowering the cloture threshold to 51 votes, but that\u2019s wishful thinking. Even if they could, moderate Republicans aren\u2019t likely to support radical ideas like those in Project 2025.\n\nAnd in the House, things aren\u2019t looking much better. Neither side will likely hold a big majority, so Republicans would need every single one of their members on board, and that\u2019s before even thinking about Democrat opposition.\n\nWithout support from both houses, Trump will be stuck. His only moves will likely be executive orders- limited in scope, mostly symbolic, and easy to undo by the next administration. Trumps only legacy will be what a jerk he is and this entire chapter of American history will serve as a warning for future generations.\u00a0\n\nSo, what\u2019s the payoff here for them?

The same reason people like Logan Paul, Andrew Tate draw in these men, Mr Beast knows boys being boys is something boys wanna see. At the release of his employer manifesto where he encouraged as much lawlessness as possible, to lean into boys being stupid I feel that this Trump fraternity is what drew this in. \n\nThere's also been a huge shift in culture to be very hateful and annoyed at LGBTQ and especially the trans community with that push of \"super straight\" trend on Tiktok. \n\nPeople think that the crazy wild things that Trump is saying is just sensationalized but we already know the abortion bans have affected so many women. The infant mortality rate STATICALLY has shown more deaths but no one cares because a death of a baby from lack of abortion care doesn't affect the men. They don't realize that these abortion bans affect women who also WANT their baby.

And with GenZ being the least turn out Chappell Roans indifference created so much apathy that it made you feel like it didn't matter if you voted.

I have five close male friends who did the same. These men are out there and if a man isn't like that, DO NOT SLEEP WITH HIM. Or marry him. Or ever cook a single meal for him. I don't care if he's has a six pack and is sooooo cute. Pay attention to the things that matter.\n\nMan says something like \"oh, a woman should cook\"?

If it's a smaller issue that could be a genuine misunderstanding, a conversation about it is fine. If it's a clear pattern that they adhere to patriarchal beliefs, instant dump. \n\nMen care a lot when women withhold sex, affection, etc. from them. Look at all the pent-up rage on any incel forum for hard proof. Men do care if nobody ever goes near them with a ten foot pole because of their disgusting outdated beliefs and if women choose anybody but them. Not passing down their disgusting genes is also a long-term bonus. \n\nBut if you fail to do this, and keep fucking, reproducing with, and cooking for the men who support a rapist because \"oh, he's just so cute and has amazing abs, I'm so attracted\", then yeah, you're enabling this. \n\nActions have consequences. \n\nDo not fuck the \"cute country boy\" who votes for Trump. \n\nIf you fuck him, absolutely never have his baby.

That includes this election too. For example - something like Trump should have never even been a candidate at all, regardless of who is willing to vote for him). \n\nhttps://redsails.org/the-pitfalls-of-liberalism/ (to understand why neoliberals are historically and systemically complicit in that violence).\n\n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1884/origin-family/\n(Works of Frederick Engels 1884, The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State, to understand how patriarchy, birth, capitalism and abortions are connected). \n\nBasically, the institution of patriarchal family required, as its foundation, the dominance of the man over the woman and the confinement of all property relations within the family / to secure property inheritance within male lineage. As a result, women were confined to roles of childbearing and household labor, making them \"means of production and reproduction\" to sustain family wealth. This structure arose from the value placed on private property and inheritance, creating social control over women\u2019s labor and reproduction. Capitalism later built on this setup, relying on women\u2019s unpaid domestic labor to maintain a steady workforce, reinforcing male dominance and the exploitation of women to sustain the economic system.\n\n\nIn addition:\n\n1) Read leftist theory. Political education IS important to truly grasp what is happening in your society & why and why it obviously affects you and your rights and so on. \n\n2) Join leftist orgs, in particular marxist feminist orgs in your community, if you have none, start forming them! Endless of women who could never rely on the US settler state and its laws  to protect them or aid them, had to rely through history on mutual aid, being part of a community that shows up for eachother and so on. (That includes underground movements). \n\n(Note: I wanted to make a radical marxist feminist platform on discord, meaning anti western imperial, capitalist and choice feminist nonsense - that does not center straight cis men - anyone is interested, hit me up via PM). \n\n3) Organized protests. No, not holding signs and bs - organized worker protests with demands. You will have to connect across your country, decide on the demands you have and walk out. Walk out of your jobs, your roles as mothers, grandmothers, workers. You all have been the shit pacified while not acknowledging that your BIGGEST weapon is the fact that you make half of your society and if you refuse to do labor for a certain period of time - your society is gonna shake. They rely on your free labor, your physical labor, all of it. \n\n4) Divest from men, build and nurture solidarity and community with other women. Think \"xyz dude is cute\", does he give a fuck about your rights? Does he give a fuck about systemic oppression, history and so on? No? Move on. Stop putting your energy into relationships with men who do not even care for your basic human rights. \n\n5) Divest from sex in any form that can get you pregnant. There are endless of other ways to get off. Maybe that will motivate some of the men in your life to actually give a fck? Probably not hmm. Eitherway, less chances to get pregnant. \n\n6) If that is not a sacrifice you want to bring for more safety and you still want to take more risks, copper IUD, hormonal IUD, hormonal implant, tied tubes & expecting the men in your life to step tf up! Keep in mind that even after vasectomies it might not be safe for months & there needs to be a frequent visits to make sure sperm count is in order (plus still use condoms in addition to make sure you are safe). Never center short term convenience and pleasure over your physical safety in a society that will treat you as an incubator and is more than willing to see you dead.\n\n7) Pregnancy strike. I am not sure how any woman is still willing to pop babies... but those ideologies and rules are not only for women who don't want kids. If you want kids you are not automatically \"safe\". It could still get you killed. Consider that. \n\n8) Do not automatically trust your family, partner or doctors or anyone, if you deal with unwanted pregnancy. \n\n9) Don't leave any traces or records online those track your period & could potentially be used to incriminate you.\n\n10) Consider moving to another country if it is something you can afford. \n\n11) Have an emergency fund if that is something you can afford.\n\n12) Train & arm yourself.\n\n13) if you were contemplating divorce - go for it now.",

I\u2019ve been on the fence because I\u2019ve been there done that and I\u2019m perfectly happy with my life the way it is.\n\nThis morning, I told my boyfriend I\u2019m not getting pregnant during this next administration or while we live in Texas because I\u2019m not willing to die if some complication arises during the pregnancy. We can\u2019t move because of a child custody arrangement I have here. So Texas is the hellscape we\u2019re bound to.\n\nI asked if he would stay with me now that he knew where I stood. He said he wasn\u2019t sure because having a child and a family of his own was important to him. I asked if he was open to adoption or fostering. And after some back and forth trying to pull the answer out of him. He said no. The only way he\u2019d consider that is if he couldn\u2019t have them himself.\n\nI doubled down on my stance that I won\u2019t be getting pregnant. And by the time a new administration and new policies roll around, that\u2019ll put us approaching 40 and past the point of having a child.\n\nI told him he needed to think about it. Really think about it and have an answer for me before this weekend. I was supposed to meet his parents on Sunday. He was supposed to meet my family during the Thanksgiving holiday.\n\nThat conversation was 3 hours ago. He\u2019s cried on his own. I\u2019ve cried on my own. I\u2019m pretty sure I know his answer at this point.\n\nIt hurts to realize that what we have isn\u2019t enough for him.

         "From one Mike to another. Regardless of the statistics you're quoting, each woman has the absolute right to make decisions about her own body and reproductive choices. This isn't about \"not getting her way in one election\" - it's about her personal assessment of risks she's willing to take with her life and health. She's being incredibly thoughtful and upfront with her partner about her boundaries and concerns.\n\nNo one should have to justify their reproductive choices with statistics. The reality is that any risk of death or serious complications is a valid concern, and she's the only one who gets to decide if that risk is acceptable to her. The risk of dying in a plane crash is extremely low statistically, but imagine if someone not only forced you onto that plane while you were terrified, but also took away your right to get off if something started going wrong during the flight. Those statistics wouldn't matter much to you then, would they? That fear and loss of control would be very real. The feelings are real. Yet, you nor I will ever experience it. \n\nInstead of dismissing her very real concerns, perhaps consider that she's making a difficult but clear-eyed decision about her future. She's being honest with her partner and giving him the respect of making his own informed choice as well. That's not \"blowing up her life\" - that's being a responsible adult who knows her own mind.\n\nSometimes people have fundamentally different life goals, and recognizing that early is far better than compromising on something as life-changing as having children. Maybe you should respect her agency in making this decision rather than trying to minimize her valid concerns. Baring that, respectively stay in your lane.",

You were a young woman, just starting out in the adult world, and you had hope for equality.\n\nIn 2nd grade, for career day at school we were asked to dress up as what we wanted to be when we grew up. I said I wanted to be a teacher like you and grandma. You sat me down and explained how you didn't have many options for a career, and you were fortunate to go to college at all. You said I had so many options you didn't, and I better not waste them. I promised I wouldn't be a teacher. \n\nAfter you separated from my father, I watched you run the household all by yourself. You mowed the lawn, fixed the toilet, painted the house. You told me men will let you down and I needed to know how to do things myself. \n\nI moved away for college and grew into a successful independent woman. I did not repeat the mistakes you warned me about, with my career or my relationships. I carried those lessons with me. You were proud.\n\nYet today, I am so deeply disappointed in you and the million women like you. How did you raise me to be a feminist and then fail to be one yourself? What made you choose a rapist and conman who will hurt my future and the future of your granddaughters?\n\nYour father fought the nazis in north Africa. Your grandmother you never met was in a camp in Vichy France. The horrors of facism are not some distant history. It's our family's history, and so many other American families too. How can you be on the side of people who wave swastika flags?\n\nI thought you were better than this. I thought our country was better than this. I feel absolutely sick to be so wrong.

It\u2019s being talked about like it\u2019s the only option. It sounds like people think the only branches on this decision tree are giving birth or abortion. No one is talking about abstinence, birth control, or contraception; the literal ABCs of safe sex. Are there cases where these aren\u2019t options? Of course. Do I think there is a place for abortion? Yes. No woman should have to fee they have to die to give birth in the instance of a problematic birth and no woman should be forced to birth the child of a rapist\u2026FURTHER contributing to the physical and psychological trauma they have endured.

         "Reposting my comment from another post, because it's important.\n\nStart researching historical emmenagogues. Stay away from any that include mineral ingredients, and look up the contraindications of botanical ingredients. Be safe and smart - just because it's not a \"chemical\" (and really, everything's a chemical) doesn't mean it's safe... but women have managed their fertility since long before condoms (c. 1750), IUDs, and hormonal birth control. And they wouldn't have kept using these compounds if they didn't work.\n\nEmmenagogues were a class of medicines to \"bring down the menses,\" or, in other words, to enact an early abortion, from a time when abortion wasn't abortion until the fetus quickened (started moving in the womb). Tansy, pennyroyal, black cohosh, rue - these and more are botanical ingredients that one can still safely purchase (for now...). A self-managed abortion can be just as safe and effective as the more traditional, facility-based approach, but DO NOT GO TO TIKTOK FOR RECIPES. \n\nYou will want to have someone you trust with you when taking an emmenagogue, if at all possible, in case something goes wrong, because things can go wrong with even the safest of medications/treatments for the most benign issues. You could have an unknown allergy to one of the botanicals you've selected. Be on the lookout for a very high fever, or an extended high fever - this can be a sign of allergic reaction, or worse. Don't take aspirin for any aches or cramping, because it's a blood thinner and can increase bleeding - a heating pad, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or a tea made from poppy petals (you can get this online, especially on Etsy, by searching for either poppy petals or poppy tea, and no, California poppy is not the same thing) are safer options. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, low fever, chills, and dizziness are all common side effects of emmenagogues. The earlier in the (suspected) pregnancy that you self-medicate, the more likely it is that the embryo (gray or white tissue) will pass unnoticed within a blood clot, and if it's early enough, it won't be big enough to be visible to the naked eye at all. Embryos are less than 1 inch in size until about 9 weeks after the first day of your last menstrual period. At 10 weeks, the cells, now called a fetus, are about 1.5 inches in size and may have recognizable details. Cramping and bleeding will slow after it comes out. If you are going through pads like crazy while bleeding - NO TAMPONS - for more than 4 hours, then you will want to head to the ER (obviously it's probably unsafe to say that you tried to self-induce an abortion, but do be honest in what you took regarding ingredients, because that may affect the medications you're given - \"I took an herbal supplement to regulate my period, it had black cohosh and rue\" is not technically a lie).\n\nA false-positive pregnancy test result can happen up to 4 weeks afterwards, because your hormone levels are still reflecting your previous pregnancy, and it takes a little time for them to go back to their typical levels. Take a pregnancy test about 2 weeks after taking all medications or passing the pregnancy. Take note of the date and the result received, then take another pregnancy test the following week. If the results of the first and second tests are negative, the emmenagogue likely worked as intended.\n\nYou may find the Reproductive Health Access Project's page [useful](https://www.reproductiveaccess.org/resource/insights-herbal-abortion-a-holistic-approach-to-care/).\n\nTheir page of [do's and don'ts](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qpvgqa6_W6nIYTklznFpT8tnR-XhernoEiPTLv_-lio/edit).\n\nYou might also find this recent [academic article](https://academicworks.cuny.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1146&context=gj_etds) on the experience of an herbal abortion useful.\n\nHope the formatting works. I am a medical historian who is not a doctor, so of course I cannot (and thus am not) diagnosing, prescribing, or recommending anything, but providing some information so that my sisters who can't afford or otherwise access formal reproductive care can make their own informed choices - especially if republicans take away other birth control options.",

That includes this election too. For example - something like Trump should have never even been a candidate at all, regardless of who is willing to vote for him). \n\nhttps://redsails.org/the-pitfalls-of-liberalism/ (to understand why neoliberals are historically and systemically complicit in that violence).\n\n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1884/origin-family/\n(Works of Frederick Engels 1884, The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State, to understand how patriarchy, birth, capitalism and abortions are connected). \n\nBasically, the institution of patriarchal family required, as its foundation, the dominance of the man over the woman and the confinement of all property relations within the family / to secure property inheritance within male lineage. As a result, women were confined to roles of childbearing and household labor, making them \"means of production and reproduction\" to sustain family wealth. This structure arose from the value placed on private property and inheritance, creating social control over women\u2019s labor and reproduction. Capitalism later built on this setup, relying on women\u2019s unpaid domestic labor to maintain a steady workforce, reinforcing male dominance and the exploitation of women to sustain the economic system.\n\n\nIn addition:\n\n1) Read leftist theory. Political education IS important to truly grasp what is happening in your society & why and why it obviously affects you and your rights and so on. \n\n2) Join leftist orgs, in particular marxist feminist orgs in your community, if you have none, start forming them! Endless of women who could never rely on the US settler state and its laws  to protect them or aid them, had to rely through history on mutual aid, being part of a community that shows up for eachother and so on. (That includes underground movements). \n\n(Note: I wanted to make a radical marxist feminist platform on discord, meaning anti western imperial, capitalist and choice feminist nonsense - that does not center straight cis men - anyone is interested, hit me up via PM). \n\n3) Organized protests. No, not holding signs and bs - organized worker protests with demands. You will have to connect across your country, decide on the demands you have and walk out. Walk out of your jobs, your roles as mothers, grandmothers, workers. You all have been the shit pacified while not acknowledging that your BIGGEST weapon is the fact that you make half of your society and if you refuse to do labor for a certain period of time - your society is gonna shake. They rely on your free labor, your physical labor, all of it. \n\n4) Divest from men, build and nurture solidarity and community with other women. Think \"xyz dude is cute\", does he give a fuck about your rights? Does he give a fuck about systemic oppression, history and so on? No? Move on. Stop putting your energy into relationships with men who do not even care for your basic human rights. \n\n5) Divest from sex in any form that can get you pregnant. There are endless of other ways to get off. Maybe that will motivate some of the men in your life to actually give a fck? Probably not hmm. Eitherway, less chances to get pregnant. \n\n6) If that is not a sacrifice you want to bring for more safety and you still want to take more risks, copper IUD, hormonal IUD, hormonal implant, tied tubes & expecting the men in your life to step tf up! Keep in mind that even after vasectomies it might not be safe for months & there needs to be a frequent visits to make sure sperm count is in order (plus still use condoms in addition to make sure you are safe). Never center short term convenience and pleasure over your physical safety in a society that will treat you as an incubator and is more than willing to see you dead.\n\n7) Pregnancy strike. I am not sure how any woman is still willing to pop babies... but those ideologies and rules are not only for women who don't want kids. If you want kids you are not automatically \"safe\". It could still get you killed. Consider that. \n\n8) Do not automatically trust your family, partner or doctors or anyone, if you deal with unwanted pregnancy. \n\n9) Don't leave any traces or records online those track your period & could potentially be used to incriminate you.\n\n10) Consider moving to another country if it is something you can afford. \n\n11) Have an emergency fund if that is something you can afford.\n\n12) Train & arm yourself.\n\n13) if you were contemplating divorce - go for it now",

People voted on race and figured as long as they don\u2019t have brown skin, the racists won\u2019t go after them and they\u2019ll be better off. \n\nAs for blue states, yes blue states might in the short term be safer, but the republicans control the pipeline of federal monies in a few months. Blue stronghold states are going to be punished by Trump and his sycophants, and any state that depends on federal funding or has a high amount of federally controlled land is thoroughly screwed if they\u2019re a blue stronghold. \n\nStates such as Washington, Oregon, Hawaii, and Minnesota for example. California at least has a solid tax base that they might be fine, but huge amounts of land in California are federally controlled still. \n\nGetting out of the country is difficult and expensive as well, and honestly most people won\u2019t be able to afford it. \n\nI fear many of us may find ourselves researching how to apply for asylum in other countries in the coming months and years.",

         "I will repost this (you can quote me and repost it too if you want) cause women in the US really need to grasp they can't just cherry pick which violence of the US settler state they embrace - eventually it is gonna come for them one way or another. \n\nRegardless of who wins, I actually truly hope that if none of the other violence the US settler state causes makes a lot of you reflect on your \"electoral politics\" - this shit right here will make you angry enough to not want to entertain something like it again & also understand that no matter what political theater your society pulls, you cant just \"outvote\" the racist and fascist nature of your society. \n\nhttps://www.indigenousaction.org/voting-is-not-harm-reduction-an-indigenous-perspective/\n\nhttps://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/coordination-of-anarchist-groups-against-democracy (to understand why neoliberals in the West acting like electoral politics for the status quo, are not the \"freedom\" and fair process most of you all think it is. That includes this election too. For example - something like Trump should have never even been a candidate at all, regardless of who is willing to vote for him). \n\nhttps://redsails.org/the-pitfalls-of-liberalism/ (to understand why neoliberals are historically and systemically complicit in that violence).\n\n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1884/origin-family/\n(Works of Frederick Engels 1884, The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State, to understand how patriarchy, birth, capitalism and abortions are connected). \n\nBasically, the institution of patriarchal family required, as its foundation, the dominance of the man over the woman and the confinement of all property relations within the family / to secure property inheritance within male lineage. As a result, women were confined to roles of childbearing and household labor, making them \"means of production and reproduction\" to sustain family wealth. This structure arose from the value placed on private property and inheritance, creating social control over women\u2019s labor and reproduction. Capitalism later built on this setup, relying on women\u2019s unpaid domestic labor to maintain a steady workforce, reinforcing male dominance and the exploitation of women to sustain the economic system.\n\n\nIn addition:\n\n1) Read leftist theory. Political education IS important to truly grasp what is happening in your society & why and why it obviously affects you and your rights and so on. \n\n2) Join leftist orgs, in particular marxist feminist orgs in your community, if you have none, start forming them! Endless of women who could never rely on the US settler state and its laws  to protect them or aid them, had to rely through history on mutual aid, being part of a community that shows up for eachother and so on. (That includes underground movements). \n\n(Note: I wanted to make a radical marxist feminist platform on discord, meaning anti western imperial, capitalist and choice feminist nonsense - that does not center straight cis men - anyone is interested, hit me up via PM). \n\n3) Organized protests. No, not holding signs and bs - organized worker protests with demands. You will have to connect across your country, decide on the demands you have and walk out. Walk out of your jobs, your roles as mothers, grandmothers, workers. You all have been the shit pacified while not acknowledging that your BIGGEST weapon is the fact that you make half of your society and if you refuse to do labor for a certain period of time - your society is gonna shake. They rely on your free labor, your physical labor, all of it. \n\n4) Divest from men, build and nurture solidarity and community with other women. Think \"xyz dude is cute\", does he give a fuck about your rights? Does he give a fuck about systemic oppression, history and so on? No? Move on. Stop putting your energy into relationships with men who do not even care for your basic human rights. \n\n5) Divest from sex in any form that can get you pregnant. There are endless of other ways to get off. Maybe that will motivate some of the men in your life to actually give a fck? Probably not hmm. Eitherway, less chances to get pregnant. \n\n6) If that is not a sacrifice you want to bring for more safety and you still want to take more risks, copper IUD, hormonal IUD, hormonal implant, tied tubes & expecting the men in your life to step tf up! Keep in mind that even after vasectomies it might not be safe for months & there needs to be a frequent visits to make sure sperm count is in order (plus still use condoms in addition to make sure you are safe). Never center short term convenience and pleasure over your physical safety in a society that will treat you as an incubator and is more than willing to see you dead.\n\n7) Pregnancy strike. I am not sure how any woman is still willing to pop babies... but those ideologies and rules are not only for women who don't want kids. If you want kids you are not automatically \"safe\". It could still get you killed. Consider that. \n\n8) Do not automatically trust your family, partner or doctors or anyone, if you deal with unwanted pregnancy. \n\n9) Don't leave any traces or records online those track your period & could potentially be used to incriminate you.\n\n10) Consider moving to another country if it is something you can afford. \n\n11) Have an emergency fund if that is something you can afford.\n\n12) Train & arm yourself.\n\n13) if you were contemplating divorce - go for it now",

My point is that sexuality is personal and human and important and it's 1) unreasonable to demand that all women go on \"sex strike\" and 2) the idea of a \"sex strike\" carries some implications that imo are pretty misogynist and backwards and that echo the lies incels/religious conservatives believe about women, our sexuality, and our role in relationships.\n\nTake care of yourself <3",

I care about our side and what the idea of a sex ban implies for women.\n\nI'm saying that expecting women to \"withhold sex\" assumes that sex \u2014 and romantic love, more importantly \u2014 is something most of can and should be expected to cut out of our lives. To me, this idea echoes the sexist thought you see in conservative religious and incel spaces that women have this cool detachment from sex \u2014 that we aren't sexual creatures  like men are, that we can just decide to be \"\"\"pure\"\"\" and celibate without losing something important about ourselves and our humanity. That sex isn't a part of our humanity. Sex isn't just about fun. It is about love. And love is part of our humanity. \n\nPersonally, I can't give that up.  I can't give up love, and I won't. I love my partner, he loves me. He's as torn up \u2014\u00a0if not more \u2014\u00a0about what's happening than I am. He isn't the problem. A lot of individual men aren't the problem. I have a lot of rage at men as a class, but I don't hate the individual men I know who are good allies now just because they're men.\n\nDo I think women should be in partnerships with men who don't respect their humanity and who vote and act against their rights? Absolutely not. Do I think women should consider very carefully who they get into relationships with and effecitvely trust with their lives? Yes. I just find the idea of a blanket ban on heterosexuality pretty ridiculous.  \n\nI definitely have empathy. I wouldn't have kids in the US right now. But I understand that some women will still choose to risk their lives having kids *because the risk is personally worth it to them \u2014* and yes, some women already willingly do this already, i.e. people choosing to go forward with risky multiples pregnancies and other high-risk pregnancies. I don't see those women as gender traitors. I see them as sisters who made a choice I wouldn't. And I empathize with women who feel they cannot be in any relationship with any man right now. I just would hope that those women would extend the same empathy to their sisters who cannot or will not make the same choice. \n\nI hope that's a bit clearer.",

We are experts at taking care of the emotions of the people around us, but we fail to recognize our very own emotions as what they are and do something with them. \n\nInstead of feeling angry because we've had to ask 1000x for whatever we feel guilt because we asked 1000x for whatever. Or instead of realizing we're surrounded by fucking losers that can't be bothered to care or because we are unsafe we think our anxiety is because we didn't do what we should have. We care so much about taking care of others' emotions that we ignore our own.\n\nSome women have done an amazing job of correcting that in themselves, I look up to those women, and I often fail, but even those women I think can do better. \n\nDon't forget  judgemental, embarrassed, appalled, revolted, nauseous, detestable, horrified, and resentful feelings are feelings of **disgust**\n\n**We should be disgusted**\n\nHelplessness, Frightened, Overwhelmed, Worried, insignificant, excluded, persecuted, nervous, and exposed are feelings of **fear**\n\n**We should be fearful**\n\nDisappointment, fear, resentment, bitterness, hostility,  numbness, indignant, infuriated, betrayed, violated, annoyed feelings are feelings of **anger**. \n\n**WE SHOULD BE ANGRY**\n\nDon't let it fade.  Hold into the anger.  Do Something with it, maybe not today,  but tomorrow or the next day. \n\nDon't let it fade.  Remember it.  Don't be complicit.  Revolt in the ways you can. Remember that not one of the fuckasses that voted for that litigated rapist, felon, and pedophile or couldn't hold their nose to vote for a woman gave a flying fuck about you. Be manipulative. Hide what you must. Pull strings in the background.\n\n\nI haven't been cared about by my own family since I was raped by my sisters fiance when I was 14. They preferred to sweep it under the rug and ignore me.  And later on, when I was maladjusted to  blame demonic influences instead of own up to their horrific, sexist, belittling, gross fucking parenting of a child. And yet.. i still found it within me to care about them. They voted for trump,  all of them, and *I'M FUCKIN DONE*\"\n\nSomething broke in me,  I'm fucking angry. I'm never going to capitulate. I'm never going to show *real* respect for anyone that hasn't fucking earned it.  The ones who haven't earned it deserve all of my wrath and there's a fucking lot of it. I will not be remorseful for manipulation against those that voted for a fucking lunatic because he's not a woman and economy.  I will not pour all of myself into those that are dry wells of fucking nothing for me.  I will not work diligently to support some mother fucker than only wants me in the workforce to extract the unique skills I provide as a woman that further their profits, instead I will be inept and incapable.\n\nWe are the fucking Goddess Kali.

At the head of the world's mightiest military? Honestly, nothing short of nukes is even gonna slow down the US. Ukraine has been working with US' dregs and castoffs and utterly clowning on Russia. Unless China is much better, and considering the state of their infrastructure, I'm not counting on it, things might heat up in ways even the other oligarchs didn't expect.",
         "Yep. They have taken abortion,  birth control and no fault divorce is next. They stacked the courts already from top to bottom, and more they have full control over the entire fucking government.  \n\nThomas in his RvW decision actually mentioned same sex marriage and birth control,  and in so doing (despite his fetid attempt to set down limits) opened up the door for a target on interracial marriages. When he stops being useful,  he and his wife will be on the chopping block with the rest of us and all the other useful idiots.",

Clearly, he was still a scumbag, but he's now such a seething, ranting, narcissistic person in public. Hard to know what to take away from the fact that people apparently have no problem with that. He's spent like 75% of his rallies for months now just going on about how bad his enemies are, how good his crowds are, how no one could ever compare to him, how he could go home and relax but he's there to talk to everyone because he's such a swell guy, etc. So fucking over just hearing the cunt talk, let alone his policy ideas",

It's no shit that if you consume media that's on one side, it will eventually convince you otherwise... Right? Which is why I think it's a bit funny too and ironic too. \n\nShe kept saying how the interviews Joe Rogan did with Trump and Elon says a lot about 'what you need to know'. I'll be honest, I DON'T think I can sit through like an hour long podcast of either one of them talking LOL\n\nEta: I just wanted to say I think it's crazy in general how a convicted felon can run for this position...

Not worrying about the women who have to make such a devastating decision. I actually feel sorry for her and her lack of empathy.",
         "It's really more simple than that. People didn't vote for her cos she was both female and POC. Ofc, they couldn't SAY that in public, so when pollsters asked, they lied. Gotta face facts: Humans are evil and dumb. They will literally trade 50% of their population to a guy who claims he has an answer to their economic woes, even if he's talking bullsheet, compared to someone who doesn't have a clear answer.",

The craziest thing is realising they are both total grifters who've seemingly only gone to the hard right for power, after years of not even believing some of this crap. Fucking insane to consider. Imagine not only going on to damage your country greatly, but doing so while perhaps not even holding the beliefs underpinning your disastrous policy moves",

And I mean, we really are all taught that women and women's issues are not very important. There are alot of conservative pro choice women who are just like \"yeah, I'm upset about women's lives being at risk, but that's less important than [whatever mens issues etc]\"",

A poll of 1,000 Pennsylvania voters from the Center for Working-Class Politics (CWCP), Jacobin, and YouGov shows that the campaign was tentatively heading in the right direction this summer.\n\n> In late August, the historian Eric Foner wrote that Democrats were attempting to make the election about competing definitions of freedom \u2014 about, as Tim Walz said in his acceptance speech, \u201cthe freedom to make a better life for yourself and the people that you love,\u201d against the freedom of corporations \u201cto pollute your air\u201d and banks to \u201ctake advantage of customers.\u201d UAW president Shawn Fain went even further at the national convention in naming and blaming the villains that stand in the way of a better life for working people: \u201cCorporate greed turns blue-collar blood, sweat, and tears into Wall Street stock buybacks and CEO jackpots,\u201d he argued, adding that Trump was a \u201cscab\u201d who would protect the interests of corporations and billionaires. That same month, the campaign announced a series of commitments to tackle the housing shortage, crack down on price gouging, and raise the minimum wage.\n\nOur survey found strong support for this kind of economic populist messaging and widespread antipathy for billionaires and corporate elites, especially among constituencies that Harris has struggled to reach \u2014 union members, voters without a college degree, and blue-collar voters, with whom Harris was trailing by 4, 7, and 19 points respectively in our poll. Despite these clear findings, Harris has pivoted away from anti-elite, economic messaging in the last month of the campaign and backtracked or de-emphasized some of her more popular policies in response to pressure from the business community.\n\n> Democrats have once again decided to place the very risky bet that catering to moderate, college-educated voters will win more support than it loses in working-class defections. Leading up to election day, they\u2019ve put most of their chips on a message that warns voters of the threat posed by a second Trump presidency. If our study\u2019s results are any indication, it\u2019s a gamble that could backfire massively.",

That's someone I want to be like!\" \n\nI want little girls and young women to look up to Harris like I looked up to Ferraro and know that this was possible and even though she didn't make it, it wasn't because of her but because of sexism. We need to ban together and fight back. We're stronger together. We're better together. They should not divide us. We cannot afford to let them.",

After seven long years of this, I finally realized it was extraordinary, that this was not how a family was supposed to act, we weren't supposed to be tearing at each others throats all the time and one time when I was serving once more as the family chew toy, I had enough, and demanded to know how she could act so ruthlessly to her own flesh and blood. She couldn't look me in the eye, but just said something to the effect of \"you'll understand when you have kids.\" She, at least in the moment, denied that she had agency and was actively choosing to be abusive and to stay with an abuser. Retrospectively, this is what caused the first major depressive episode of my life.\n\nShe did leave him later that year, one of the happiest moments of my life, and I like to think it was partially my obstinance that gave her the courage to do so, though she's never admitted as much.  I think she's still angry at me because I gave him the benefit of the doubt when I saw him.... humbled for the first time in my life.  I never thought before meeting him for the first time after the divorce that I'd ever feel even the tiniest drop of sympathy for that man, but there he was like a wounded animal, my father being polite, kind and most surprising of all, respectful, to me in a way none of the rest of my family ever once acted towards me, not that it lasted very long, but I had no way of knowing that at 7 years old.\n\n  My mom never forgave me for forgiving him, not even 15 years later at his funeral, she just made some snide remark towards me about him I can't even remember the details of besides the pain of old wounds being callously opened again. It's okay though, I don't know everything he put her through, so I can't exactly judge her.\n\nThinking back though, that feeling you mention about never thinking we'll actually move the needle but refusing to give up, that was the feeling that got me to speak up, and it was the tiny ember that smoldered within me no matter how powerless I felt as a kid.  I am not them, I would not do what you are doing to me at seven years old.  In my darkest moments, when I feel everything is lost, I just whisper to that seven year old little boy, \"don't worry, she's wrong. you'd never be her, you're better than that.\" and it always gives me at least a little bit more strength.",

Seemingly, he was quite strenuous in his insistence. In one email, Lloyd relates that a pregnant woman in his care who was seeking\u2014and being kept from having\u2014an abortion mentioned suicide.

I also, in the past week, had a neighbor kid attack my kid and then his dad threaten us so badly the cops were like \u201cwhoa, that\u2019s bad. Glad you reported\u201d, found out my mom has cancer, and found out my senior dog is senile and probably won\u2019t last to Christmas. The only benefit is that I\u2019m too numb to feel the bulk of the crushing sadness and rage I know is lurking inside of me.",

         "I'm absolutely gutted. There really aren't words to describe how I'm feeling right now. It's like experiencing all the of grief while simultaneously drowning in a pit of hellfire. Hopelessness, despair, shame for my country, devastation, anger... \n\nBut mostly I'm just sad. I'm sad that after all the hope I had, it was for less than nothing. I'm sad that I have a daughter whose entire life could be affected. I'm sad that so many people hate the idea of progress so much that they'd rather have... him. I'm sad for everyone that will be harmed and endangered for years to come because of this. I'm just sad.",
         "I had to ask my therapist to move my appointment online because I feel too unsafe to leave my house alone. Having flashbacks to the last Trump election when I was attacked by two supporters while walking my service dog.",

It doesn't matter that he's been here since he was 1 and has bent over backwards making sure his citizenship is valid. They're going to come for him. And if it isn't ICE, I've had to listen to my coworkers talk about taking it into their own hands for weeks now. Attack them, kill them, leave the bodies to be seen as a message. Im so fucking scared and I don't want to uproot my entire life, but I have to now. I'm not going to be safe either, I've been hearing talks of kill the f***ots and round up the disabled, I fall into both of those categories. If it's not the government thay gets us, it's the supporters.",
         "This makes the shock and grief I felt in 2016 pale in comparison. I'm ashamed and angry that so many Americans feel like the rising tide of fascism is a *good* thing and they want in on it. I'm wishing I'd gone for a tubal ligation instead of an IUD earlier this year. My husband is a teacher, and we're in a state that relies heavily on federal funding for education funding because of our fakakta state taxation system. I'm worried for his job. I'm worried for his students.",

I am horrified and terrified at what that idiot plans to do to our country, but I know the only people who will benefit from him will be other awful rich white men.  Anybody else can go fuck themselves.  I'm old, I can hide, sorta.  My kids and grands?  They have to LIVE through this.",

My stomach has been in knots since last night when I kept watching his electors get closer and closer to 270.",
         "It's horrifying to see this all happen again, but worse. I've studied our history and believed that we, as a people, were at least improving. Seeing the results today has been soul crushing. I don't think I can believe in humanity, even after seeing what we can do. It's heart breaking how so many can vote and ignore the context of it, or choose not to vote. History is pretty dark, and seeing the U.S. embrace someone so openly fascistic and such an awful human, while also hearing what the goals of his party are in Project 2025... I want to do what I can to keep pushing forward, but today is just grieving. Hugs to everyone here.",

To be afforded healthcare is not a niche issue - it's a mark of a civilised society. It's a goddamn travesty we have continued to rear children with zero transfer of the wisdom and skill it takes because the men are persistently disinterested. \n\nGive the men lime in their water barrels on the ships. It will stop them from dying from scurvy. \n\nGive them penicillin in the trenches it will save their limbs. \n\nGive the woman a curette, it will save her life and fertility. \n\nCan someone point me to the point where it all went wrong.",

         "The GOP has the corner on hate. And hate is an easier sell than hope and logic. Yet I still cannot believe how blind people are. Honestly, it makes me wonder if they did some of that vote tampering they have been accusing Dems of. Because we all know that everything they accuse Dems of doing, they are doing themselves.\n\nI don't know where it is safe to live in the US anymore.  I woke up this morning thinking that the rational states should withdraw. Let the poor Red states pay for themselves.",
         "Blue dot in red Utah. I was up all night with my husband. We were both crying and horrified that this is what our world has come to. Choosing a convicted criminal for president after the threats he\u2019s made. I\u2019m so scared for our country and what is to come. I can\u2019t focus on work, can\u2019t think, can barely breathe. I just ache all over and I know it\u2019s not going to stop because it hasn\u2019t even started yet.",
         "Unfortunately I don't think the country will recover from this one.  Not only has Trump been reelected, but now he has the House and Senate who will write him a blank check to change everything that once made this country great.  I will resist the urge to gloat when those who did vote for him this time around, will see their selfish attitudes come back and bite them on the rear when they cut social security, Medicare and everything else that they have promised to do.",
         "I've been struggling to put into words how I feel.  I saw a meme that described it as the same feeling when the second tower was hit and you realized what was going on.  Pure terror.  And I think that's where I am.  Except everyone around me is cheering.  It's horrifying.",
         "I had my cry, now I'm angry. I'm ready to take action. I just don't know what that action should be. How does one start a revolution? I'm not joking.",
         "The commonality between the two Democrat losses was that the candidate was a woman.  \n\nMen, a lot of men, will not allow a woman to have that type of power.   The amount of woman hate on my twitter timeline is gobsmacking.  Even Democrats are spewing that nonsense.  \n\nIt is incredibly sickening and it feels to me boys growing up now are learning this lesson and our outlook will continue to decline. \n\n I'm a guy but I will continue to fight alongside you folks as best I can.",
         "My worldview shattered in 2016. As a queer, disabled woman, I thought those who hated me were on the fringes. I didn't expect that hate to be from neighbors, college buddies, family friends... family. \n\nI thought, maybe, we were healing come 2022; things felt like they were turning around. Then this year, when Kamala was announced, the energy -- the joy -- the hope! It was infectious. I thought for sure we were on he right path. \n\nTo wake up, to learn that fascism won because a bunch of people decided to stay home, and another bunch of people decided that the cost of Milk was a decision Biden made personally to spite them, I... I just can't. \n\nI feel alone. I feel like my little family and I are on a raft at sea, praying that the storm clouds we see in the distance don't overtake us. If we can just weather these choppy waters, if we can just hold on for four years... \n\nIn the years between 2016 and 2020, I became a bitter, hateful, angry person because it's the only thing you can be under the trump administration. When everyone is attacking you, you either grow spikes like a cactus, or you wither. I grew spikes. I didn't like who I was made to be, but I had to be it, I had to be rude and mean in order to *live*. When Biden took over, I could relax. I could be myself again. Guarded still, but... kind. My days weren't filled with dread. My anxiety was chill. It was great. \n\nI don't want to go back to hissing and snarling at others. I want to live my life without having to defend it every day. I don't want to be the person these times turn me into. \n\nI feel terrible.",
         "I am just at the point of being numb to it all. It all seems so cyclical. Every experiment for a democracy has devolved into this. A democratic shell with an authoritarian fascist core.\n\nPart of me is ready for it all to fall apart. Apparently America needs to descend into total chaos before anyone wants progress. Unfortunately it will probably be too late. America is just too big to not have an eventually cataclysmic fall and we are watching it in action. Slow and insidious destruction of freedom in service of racism and misogyny.  \n  \nMany will die as they did during the last Trump presidency, I may be one of them. But at least we now know without a shadow of a doubt where we stand. Women and minorities dying is something a majority of this country is okay with. I think we all knew under the surface this is what America was, but we had hope we could defy it.  \n  \nWe always wonder how countries turn into dictatorships and complete dystopias, always assuring ourselves \"not in America\". If anything, it proves we are no different than a large portion of the world. There is no American exceptionalism. We can just as easily slip into fascism like we have seen happen again and again elsewhere.  \n  \nAll I can say is we need to put all of our energy into what we can control. What we have right in front of us. We need to be ready to defend each other and ourselves. For those that can afford to move out of the country, I wish you wouldn't, but that is selfish of me and I totally understand where you are coming from. For those of us that stay by choice or by necessity, we have to watch out for each other. We need to lower our walls for our sisters and try to be the safety we deserve. Now is the time we stop thinking about having families and start thinking about what we can do to help the generations that will have to suffer beyond us.  \n  \nThis may be violence, this may be peace, or this may be somewhere in the middle. We can no longer lie to ourselves that good will prevail at least in the short term. We have to be ready for what is to come and shedding our American idealism for good is the first step and seeing this country for what it really is. Just another slab of land that men will kill and be killed for so they can retain privilege and power.",

BUT...abortion must be addressed state by state and get out of the hands of legistlators who end up criminalizing medical needs and really- if \"ok for rape and incest\" that's just male outrage. The Missouri law that passed is a sign of the way to go. I know a lot of women, esp younger will disagree with me but I respect where you're coming from.

It\u2019s a good gauge for the general support of a candidate, but not necessarily indicative of who will win.\n\nThat said, 3rd party votes matter so so so much. Look at Pennsylvania. In Erie county PA the difference between DT and KH was about 1900 votes. Stein and the Libertarian candidate made up about 1240 votes and about 300 were write-ins. So, had those votes instead gone to KH, or not voted at all, the difference would be just over 300 votes. That\u2019s like, a movie theater full of people. That\u2019s it.\n\nAnd that happened/is happening all across the state, and other states with high electoral values. KH could lose the state of PA because several, certain *relatively small* counties had a couple movie theaters full of people who decided it was more important to vote for someone who would never win than to protect women, our democracy, and quite frankly our planet. \n\nThings are about to be pretty grim, I\u2019m afraid.",

I\u2019ve lost hope I\u2019ll ever live to see a woman president and I\u2019m so disturbed by what the future will look like for anyone unfortunate enough to be born female in this country.

Now, we know that this inflation was (a) less than in many other countries and (b) a direct result of the stimulus to avoid crashing the economy during the pandemic, but these complex arguments are not swaying the low-information, disengaged voter.\n\n(3) Kamala inherited (from Biden) the pandemic lockdowns and many low-information voters were angry that they couldn't move around as they might like.\n\n(4) Kamala only did 10-or-so major interviews, preferring to spend her time on the campaign trail doing rallies. This prevented people from seeing her respond to different questions and becoming familiar with her. Psychology repeatedly shows that people will choose someone whose name they recognize and who they feel familiar with EVEN IF they hate this person rather than a person that they don't feel that they know. One of the things that Obama made sure to do (and Trump also did) was heavily engage with both legacy media interviewers and social media interviewers that could create the sense of familiarity and allow the candidate to field more nuanced and individualistic questions.\n\n(5) Psychological studies have also shown that \"protecting democracy\" is actually not a very compelling argument for low-information voters, most of whom don't understand how democracy works and generally dislike the idea of governmental negotiations taking time and resulting in compromised outcomes. These people prefer an authoritarian who can \"get things done\" rather than this more consultative process. Additionally, since they are not political, they don't actually worry about the \"high-minded\" political issues but care more about tangible changes in their lives. (It's the \"Is your life now better than 4 years ago?\" question.)\n\n(6) On the other end of the spectrum, many more politically-astute voters were waiting to hear more details on Kamala's policies, especially since they diverged so strongly from her positions in 2020. She did not clarify why she flipped on these positions. So, it meant that when she spoke about women's rights (for example), she sounded genuine -- since she has consistently held this position -- and when she spoke about foreign policy (for example), she sounded like a pre-programmed soundbyte machine -- since her foreign policy position changed significantly sicne 2020.",

         "Same. Upset and enraged almost beyond words but count me in for villain era of disobedience - civil and uncivil alike - though. Resistance in large numbers is so, so SO critical from here forward. People have got to let go of the fantasy that fascists can be reasoned or compromised with, have empathy to be appealed to, any of it. \n\nI\u2019ve been very disturbed how conplacent or clueless some are - it terrifies me some miss the gravity, or simply lack the guts to defy, subvert and fight on a riskier, yes, but actually consequential level, when standing up for our rights and what is right, requires more than the familiar, widely accepted, and comfortable. I\u2019m talking about the pearl clutching for civility when some think others have gone too far, got too angry. How every fucking thread on here where someone might need or want an abortion, it seems someone is like \u201coh well, might be illegal where she is.\u201d Nothing about the possibility of getting the meds by mail or underground network, or traveling (seeking financial and logistical support from loved ones and/or groups that assist with). Like, WHO GIVES A FLYING FUCK it\u2019s illegal (besides that it shouldn\u2019t be, duh). We still have a right to travel out of state and country - and if they come for that, frankly to me that\u2019s a get out and stay out if you can, even if you have to seek asylum, level of threat. I know if I got pregnant, nothing will stop me getting UNpregrant stat. And if people had just rolled over and accepted terrible laws in past extremist regimes, where the fuck would that have gotten things? Resistance is CRITICAL. \n\nI don\u2019t have all the answers how exactly to subvert and fight to protect ourselves and other vulnerable folks as best we can. I think just starting such work - getting focused, connect to likeminded people, put initial strategy together and into action - can be one of the hardest bits, even more at the outset of threat still being processed emotionally. But I\u2019m not a total neophyte, I\u2019ve strengths and privileges to leverage - hell knows rebellion and fighting  bullies and injustice are hardwired into the core of who I am.  \n\nAnd I\u2019m fucking angry. Have been a while. In one sense, my whole life in a female, mixed race body. It\u2019s not about me more than anyone else that doesn\u2019t tick the white male hetero Christian boxes (or complicit Mrs BangMaidMommy\u2019s) but this is extra galling in a way with half my family being Indian/Caribbean Black like Harris. I\u2019m half white and hard to place without context, but  Photoshop her in a family pic on that side and it\u2019s wild how she\u2019d blend in like a younger auntie or older cousin. And two things have radicalized me in recent years (besides, you know, the news). A fight for healthcare for an otherwise life altering issue, which with getting into advocacy for gave me a whole new view of abusive systemic corruption here. And having to divorce my ex who became abusive - poisoned if not by the rest of alt right ideology, but manosphere misogyny.\n\nWords that feel anemic for how chilling that was.    I thought I had the measure of misogyny: musician since teens, raped in college, all the shit heard from friends or news. Was like I\u2019d formed my view standing on trapdoors that gave out. Wasn\u2019t physical til the very end losing his shit with losing me and basically held me hostage for a week at home. I think any abusive behavior by someone meant to love you (that has, and very possibly still acts like it between blowups) can trigger incredible cognitive dissonance. The depths of aggression and sadism at the end though\u2026 and even before, loss of ability to see me as I was thru the garbage in his mind, increasingly sexualizing everything, weaponizing sex to control and degrade. All unimaginable when we dated/married, and 20 fucking years before as friends. Thought I knew who the real scumbags in our circles were - never my nice, supportive friend that was pretty  involved in activism with all the big leftist concerns - antiracism, civil and human rights (women\u2019s included), economic and climate justice and such. 2+ years and a LOT of learning about DV, and still so much I haven\u2019t made sense of, but it\u2019s forever changed how I see men (some - but how do you really know before they inflict harm and it\u2019s a whole thing to extricate yourself) and relationships with.",

He uses appeals to emotion, strawman fallacies, ad hominem attacks; you name the logical fallacy, he uses it, and it gets an emotional reaction out of the right.  \nHe panders to racists, bigots, Christians and right-leaning men.

I'm firmly of the opinion that if the Republicans had run a moderate, statesman-like candidate they'd have an even bigger victory.  Going by the voting patterns there are millions of people who voted R in spite of Trump, not because of him. That is very telling.\n\nWe are seeing a combo of\n\n- Wholesale rejection of progressive social stances by centrist/moderate voters, including white women, college educated, and POCs/Latinos. These policies have *never* been popular with the majority; doubling down on them and making them so visible and central to policy is a vote-loser for Democrats. You simply cannot convince a majority of people that men are women, mass immigration is good, and that every last thing is either racist or transphobic or misogynistic. There are also many economically left wing people who do not subscribe to extremely these progressive positions. The bud light Dylan Mulvaney backlash is an example of how deeply unpopular these stancesare with a huge number of people. This is unfortunate but it's the reality - a \"do you want to be right, or do you want to win?\" situation for Dems. \n\n- 8 years of right wing social media indoctrination of young men (funded by various nefarious actors). The results of this are absolutely frightening \n\n- Economic illiteracy and people being unable to understand that inflation was not caused by the Dems and that an R vote is going to make the economic inequality caused by late stage monopoly capitalism worse.\n\nDems do not seem to understand that people vote on emotion rather than logic. Rs have been very good at harnessing that to get people to vote against their economics for decades now. Until they dial back on identity politics and start campaigning heavily on inequality and how Rs are the party of the rich and how their policies screw over the working and middle class then they're not going to win big at election time and time soon\n\nWriting this off as a \"people wouldn't vote for a woman\" situation is far too simplistic.",

Being autistic and constantly abused for it, I never had the luxury in believing that most people are even halfway decent. In 2016, I learned just how depraved many of my fellow citizens are. And so when I was diagnosed, a mere few weeks after Roe fell, I was *relieved*. I saw this coming, so I skipped the less invasive treatment options and had my uterus and fallopian tubes removed. My other health conditions meant a pregnancy might kill me. Why risk dying, knowing that the government had made it illegal to save me?

I could imagine this applies to many red voting people aswell, those that make money above the brackets that Trump gives benefits, want that money, they don't care about other people.

They was a rise in hate crimes immediately after; in my local town, Black people were getting threatening/hateful hand written letters and nooses sent to their homes etc etc; it was scary. Even the Obamas were getting death threats. So when I see ppl suggesting that somehow America was \u201cokay\u201d with a Black man as president, it feels dismissive.",

A man would have likely beaten Trump, so the things you are claiming would make a difference are wrong, including your claim about people's lives not being up to their standards, which with real wages outpacing inflation for a couple years now, lowest unemployment rate, etc., etc., is a either a delusion or a lie. It's not economic anxiety now or before--it's a reactionary response to women and poc making gains (never mind running for president), so a different message was never going to matter."

I tried to read up about it and found that it's called \"normalcy bias,\" a kind of thinking error that causes people to minimize warnings of actual danger.\n\nThink about all the people who didn't vote in 2000, or 2004, or 2016, and if you had said that Roe v. Wade could be overturned, they would say \"Roe v. Wade has been the law for 50 years, of course it's not going away.\"  It's not that they hated women and wanted it overturned, they just didn't believe it was going to happen.  Roe v. Wade had become normal, and so they assumed it would always continue.  I've been reading stuff online about Trump, with people saying, \"Oh, he's not going to do all that awful stuff, be a dictator, he was just joking.\"  They don't want a dictator, they're just not able to get past their normalcy bias and see that he does mean what he says.\n\nNow that I learned about that, I plan to keep it in my back pocket for the next time a \"men are more logical\" discussion gets started.  Men supporting Trump are proving that they are not objective or logical, they are thinking with emotions instead of reason, and when they dismiss warnings about how terrible he is they are proving that they lack the brainpower to get past their own normalcy bias.",

Emotions are a blessing when we learn how to be true to ourselves and not let them over take us, which women are blessed to learn and master a lot sooner than men.

It is the Women who decided almost everything and were sought out with high, sacred regard.\n\nI am in Canada and have chosen to be ignorant to the United States for the most part along with the politics here as well. I just started in university and am only now starting to learn politics at age 34. My heart has always been heavy with the news I hear from things that happen in the states. We really aren't much better up here when it comes to many things, especially the misogyny and racism. Seems to be colonial trademarks along with genocide. My room mates daughter is 12 and identifies and non binary. The amount of tears I've heard and seen come from that strong, beautiful, innocent heart in regards to bullying from school. It is normal and kids being kids but to have to switch schools because the staff also started to partake in it or would turn a blind eye thus condoning such behavior? The amount of disgusting sht the kids learn at home then bring into school projecting their parents meaningless, pitiful, shallow understandings onto others? Is growing exponentially since I was in grade school for some reason up here too.\n\nI don't think we will ever see something with balance in it when it comes to us all as a race, humanity in a global society.

         "Here\u2019s my honest take on what wrong for Democrats.\n\nTo add context, I\u2019m a guy who did vote for Kamala.\n\nFirst off, the Democratic Party essentially bullied Biden out of the race. Either he shouldn\u2019t have sought out a 2nd term from the beginning, this way it goes the primaries system to decide the next Democratic candidate, or they should\u2019ve just stuck with Biden. Hard to say what the outcome would\u2019ve been though because that\u2019s a what if at this point. Who knows, maybe Biden should\u2019ve stepped down as President too, this way it would\u2019ve gave Kamala a chance as President for voters to better gauge.\n\nSome have said the country doesn\u2019t want a female president. I would disagree with that by using the 2016 popular vote as reference, Hillary Clinton beat him on that.\n\nSecondly, the party did imho pick the worst possible replacement. Even in 2020, through the primaries, some have done much better than her. Honestly, she wasn\u2019t even on my list of people to replace Biden.\n\nThird, she didn\u2019t differentiate herself enough.\n\nI\u2019ll probably edit this to add more. I\u2019m half awake and a bit upset right now.",
