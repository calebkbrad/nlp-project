         "I know no one here has to hear this, but it bears repeating.\n\nAre you in a swing state? VOTE! No excuses! Trump is winning in Pennsylvania. Come on PA!\n\nAre you in a state where you already know which candidate will win? VOTE ANYWAY! There's important stuff going on down-ballot. Florida is going to go massively for the Orange POS, but there's a women's rights issue on the ballot. I'm in a state that is certain to go for Harris. But we're choosing a US Senator, and I don't want Steve Garvey. Every House member is up for re-election. If you don't vote we don't flip! School boards--there are insane MAGAs trying to take over the schools, in every state. \n\nIf you haven't voted, VOTE! And vote the entire ballot!",
         "I\u2019m 6 months too young to vote for her. But everyone else in my home has voted blue!",

         "Yes! \n\nAnd as a total side note as a \"forgotten\" Gen-X'er it'll be our first Gen-X president (arguably, some demographers put 1964\u2014her birth year\u2014with Gen-X, some put it late-late-late Boomer). \n\nVOTE VOTE VOTE \n\nOh here are the generations:\n\nInterbellum Generation: \n\n    Lyndon B.

         "I was just talking to my friend about this last night. We *are* going to elect the first female president EVER!! I voted and I\u2019m hopeful and I\u2019m confident. And when it happens I\u2019ll be so proud as a woman and proud of American women around the country who are sick of the pile of burning garbage that is the GOP.",

         "I have a picture of me and my daughter (then a tween) after I voted for Hillary. \n\nI'm wearing an \"I voted\"  sticker and she's wearing a \"future voter\" sticker and we both look happy and excited. \ud83d\ude0a\n\nWhen I took it I thought I had just voted for the first female president and I was so proud to have shared that with my daughter. \ud83d\udc97\n\nNow when I look at that picture I see a picture of someone whose world view was about to be shattered, like the glass ceiling that was supposed to have been smashed that night. \ud83d\udc94\n\nI no longer have faith that the American voters would never actually elect someone like Donald Trump. \ud83d\udc94\n\nI no longer have faith that the majority of Americans would give selflessly for a greater cause, like we did during WWII and the civil rights era. \ud83d\udc94\n\nI no longer have faith that the people in power would protect the regulations that gave us our clean air and water. \ud83d\udc94\n\nI no longer have faith that our National Parks are beyond the reach of greedy developers. \ud83d\udc94\n\nI no longer have faith that it would *never* happen that our elected officials would vote \"no\" on something that helps people *just because* someone from a different party came up with it. After all, that would be like cutting off your nose to spite your face! \ud83d\udc94\n\nTomorrow I will again vote for the person I hope will become our first female president. But my happiness and excitement will be tainted by an understanding that this isn't the United States that we were before Donald Trump and we will never be that United States again.",

         "I'm trying to ignore it, while trying to be comforting to the kids (apparently the other kids are talking about it at school) and my spouse. Everyone seems disheartened because of what everyone and everything that is being said. I just want some peace and some sort of normal. It's so hard to be hopeful when you see other people say some of the most vile nonsense.\n\n\nEdit: Just going to say we early voted already. So we are just trying to be supportive of others heading to the polls without losing our sanity and humanity.",
         "I\u2019m doing my part in PA tomorrow!! \ud83d\udc99 My husband, mom, grandmother, FIL, MIL, SIL, BIL, 2 aunts/uncles, and a bunch of cousins, all in PA, have already voted blue by mail-in! \ud83c\udf0a\n\nThankfully I know more people voting D than R, but the ones that hurt the most are my dad, stepmom, and 19yo brother. I thought college would help him to see outside of our dad\u2019s red bubble, but I\u2019m worried it didn\u2019t.",
         "Should be common sense to vote out the clowns that declared cheating. The opposite of a peaceful transition of power, come the fuck on",
         "I feel it too.  This is an intensely stress election.  I voted on Saturday at the last early voting.  It was a little encouraging to see quite a few young people participating.  I don't know what I will do if she loses.  I might lose my mind.",
         "I am getting up early to vote before work in the morning.  \n\nAfter I vote, I will keep off social media and keep election coverage turned off.  I do not trust polls and the election day coverage is all supposition based on sample sizes that are statistically too small to be any kind of accurate.  I absolutely hate it when they start making predictions with only 2% of precincts reporting and polls still open for several hours!\n\nI do not care how anybody votes, just that they do!  This is your chance to participate in the process try to affect change.  I am so thankful that > 100 years ago, women rallied in this country and won the right to vote and I appreciate my opportunity to do so.",
         "Not a woman, but I\u2019m scared that if Trump wins we\u2019re fucked",
         "I hope VP Harris gets elected.  We have never had the experience of a female President of the United States.  I think a woman has so much to offer.  Think about how effective most women are at running households and businesses.  Their ability to multi-task, their ability to pull everything together all the time, their ability to bring disagreements to the table and get it figured out and move forward... I think the future with a woman President will be amazing to watch unfold and who knows, we may never go back to a man in that position.",
         "I already shot my shot early. Here's hoping.\n\n\nI've been saying for years that the first woman elected president would be a psycho like MTG. I am going to be so very happy if I'm wrong.\u00a0",
         "I don't know what's going to happen tomorrow. Hopefully Kamala Harris wins in a landslide and there is nothing they can do to reverse it, no matter how many lawsuits or tricks they pull. Women's rights are at stake, and human rights as a whole are right behind them.\n\nBut no matter what happens tomorrow, never relent. Never give up. Never give in. Be the most annoying little thorn in their side. We owe it to those who came before us who believed in human rights and decency. They weren't always perfect, but they paved the way so that people like us could band together and maintain those rights. We also owe it to the people who will come after us. They deserve to be able to choose what happens to their body. They deserve to marry the person they fall in love with. They deserve to be treated as equals. Most importantly, we owe it to ourselves and others who may not be completely lost. Of course, the people who fall in line with us are a given. What we do now affects us directly. As for those who are not completely lost, a lot of young women and women in general are indoctrinated and vote against their own self interest. The young ones can still be saved. Even the older ones can still be saved. It's not fair, and it really shouldn't be up to us. The one and only reason I know they can be saved is because I used to be among them. Although I am a man, I was indoctrinated by religion. Eventually, I saw the light and the veil lifted. The greatest thing I have ever done was to vote for Barack Obama. The second greatest thing I have done is to vote for Kamala Harris. Empathy, sympathy and human decency are on the line.\n\nAnd while it is probably clich\u00e9 to say this because it's part of a song:\n\nThrough the fire and the flames, we carry on.",

         "Part of me wants to intentionally play up the doom and gloom in the hopes it gets people out to vote.\n\nBut if you haven't been convinced at this point, I don't know what it takes. If I knew absolutely nothing else about the man, him being a rapist bars him from my vote for eternity.\n\nAnd the fact that a smart and capable person is his opponent, yet the polls are roughly tied boggles my mind.\n\nI'd like to be clear, this is not a lesser of two evils vote: it is a clear decision between fascism and democracy. Harris doesn't excite me, but she definitely is someone I would like to vote for, rather than explicitly against her opponent. It just so happens that I'm doing both this time.",

I can't believe people think Trump is worth a vote.\n\nHe's a liar, a criminal, mentally unstable, geriatric and there is a non-zero chance he'd use the military against US citizens to silence their criticism.\n\nLet alone the anti-women bullshit, hell, even anti-human rights expanding beyond just women that people think it's a good idea to elect that piece of shit.",
         "I voted for the first time ever (turned 18 in July) and I did early voting with my mom! I\u2019m nervous but I\u2019m trying to hope  my mom, sister, and I\u2019s votes made a difference. My mom was so excited and walked with me to the voting area to make sure I understood everything and she\u2019s so happy I\u2019m voting for Kamala",

         "One of the things I love about Kamala is that she isn't banking on her gender. I don't recall her ever touting the fact that she's a woman, which is much, much different than how Hillary Clinton ran her campaign. Kamala is running on policy and the future of the United States, not on making history. She's already the first woman VP, breaking that glass ceiling to become the first woman President would be the icing on the very delicious cake. I voted for her and I hope enough of us did to make her President.",

         "I also want to alert everyone to pay attention to what the polls are saying today vs what the outcome is. Remember which ones were accurate and which ones were bullshit. It\u2019s only going to get worse from here regarding manipulation and misinformation.\n\nIf (when) Trump loses, the next R candidate will have all of his (lack of) values and policies without his batshit insanity, and they will talk very pretty while taking away a LOT of people\u2019s rights. We\u2019ll cross that bridge when we come to it, but we have to stay vigilant.\n\nAlso, it\u2019s definitely lost in the fray that Kamala is more than likely going to be the first woman president, and that was on purpose. Learning from the mistakes of the Hillary campaign (which weren\u2019t their fault, people are just incredibly stupid). It\u2019s definitely exciting from a historical standpoint though!",

Women really could have had the floor here to really constructively fight it out. Harris and Haley are very different and that's okay. But Trump is just such an abominable roadblock to a civilized election and social progress.",
         "Fun fact: Harris already was the first sitting female US president in history... for about 90 minutes when Biden had a colonoscopy. She did a great job.",
         "I remember in 2nd grade being told that there had never been a female president, but that \u201cmaybe someday\u201d there will be. I have been thinking about that moment a lot lately. What that does to a 7 year old girl\u2019s psyche. How is a 7 year old girl to internalize that information as anything BUT that we are \u201cless than\u201d men. Not good enough. Not strong enough. Not smart enough. Not enough. \u201cMaybe someday\u201d a woman will be [smart, strong, qualified] enough.\n\nI have a 4 year old daughter now. That moment I had as a 7 year old girl has been weighing on me a lot as a mom now.",

         "This is awesome. Maybe it's just me (a dude), but I think that we aren't focusing on the fact she's a female is a positive step. Rather, we're measuring her on her qualifications, experience, and level headed-ness as what we look for in a president. Remember she was thrust into the nomination and has owned it! LFG Kamala!",

I like that Harris hasn't been throwing it in our faces that she's a woman. The GOP have done that enough that it's refreshing to see Harris basically \"yeah, and?\" the whole thing. \n\nI truly 100% hope she wins tomorrow. Not just because she's a woman. But because she'll give hope to ALL women that their lives aren't something to be ruled over or even cast aside at the whims of others. It'll send a strong message to future leaders of our country that it doesn't matter if you're male or female, black or white, a parent or not, you CAN lead this country and you SHOULD if you have the best plan for fixing what's wrong. \n\nUnfortunately there are just way too many people clinging to the edifice of old that would rather die than admit defeat. Hopefully that era comes to an end tomorrow and we can finally move forward and heal this broken country.",

Not to mention the way she and the Ds railroaded Sanders.   \n\nAlthough, I really do wish the first woman president was someone I could get fully behind and I was not being forced to vote against the greater evil rather than for someone I actually believe in yet again.

It will take that person a half hour to get here. Then 15 minutes minimum to train them to knock on doors. Then 30 minutes minimum for the recruited canvasser to get out into the field. Then at least 15 minutes to figure out what the fuck they are doing with the app. Which means, the earliest door knock of a hypothetical volunteer (who we don't even know to exist yet) is 90 minutes before the polls close. And since voters will take at least 30 minutes to get to the polls because it's rush hour, they probably don't know where the fuck they are supposed to vote and they aren't waiting by the door with their shoes on, that means that at most, our hypothetical volunteer could knock on 10-12 hypothetical doors before it's too late. Wouldn't it be better, instead to give the volunteers that we do have tier 1 calling lists so they can make \\~75 real calls over the next 2.5 hours.\n\nThe answer I got was \"We don't have any tier one phone lists cut anyway. All we have are vol recruitment lists which are mostly made up of people who already voted.\"\n\nI just told the volunteers with laptops to log into hillary's virtual dialer or whatever and pick a state to start calling.

In NC, the Republican chief justice won his seat by just 401 votes, after Republicans took over the court they issued an opinion in a voting rights case that led to the loss of three Democratic US congressional seats, maybe 4, depending on tomorrow.

Not voting because your state is \"safe\" will encourage the politicians to continue to believe that the state is less politically diverse than it actually is. The Democrats actually spent a lot more money in Texas than they normally do this year because of how many more people have voted blue in the last 10 years. The last time Ted Cruz was up for reelection. He only lost by a very small margin. That let the Democrats know that they actually had a shot in Texas.\n\nAnd that's not even taking into account how important your votes down the ballot are. Local and state elections are very often won by extremely small margins and in many cases by less than 10 votes and those people have a lot more control over what your life day-to-day life looks like than the president does.",

      "text": "I'm a 27F and I've been married to my husband for over five years now. Over the last six months we've be discussing the idea of having a child. The other day we had a more serious conversation where we both decided that we wanted to start trying within the next year, since we both have stable jobs and a home and we feel like we're just about ready for the next step in our lives. \n\nHowever, we both agreed if Trump is elected president we will NOT have children. It's too scary. We live in a fairly blue state, but I'm terrified of a national abortion ban. What if I have complications? I'm not ready to die trying to bring a baby into this world, and my husband doesn't want to risk my life. I know the chances of death are slim, but they are not non-existent. I also have a health condition that raises the chances of preeclampsia, having a child small for gestational age, or having a stillborn. So I already have elevated risks of complications. \n\nAm I overreacting? Does anyone else feel similarly?  It's ridiculous that I feel like I have to base this personal decision around who is elected president, but it's the world we live in. Even in my blue state I wonder if my rights will be safe in a year. Since election day is tomorrow, this has been weighing heavily on me and I just needed a space to talk about it.",

         "It\u2019s a hard decision and talk. Hubs and I had this very discussion a while back, and we came to a slightly different conclusion but ultimately it\u2019s what ever makes you feel safe. \ud83d\udc95 it\u2019s a frustrating thing to even have to be put in the position to have this conversation too.",
         "I agree completely. Women are dying because their doctors are unable to care for them. I was a labor nurse for years and now am a postpartum nurse, and women\u2019s health is a huge passion of mine. I want children soon, and I want a daughter more than anything in the world, but I won\u2019t bring her into a world where her rights will be diminished because of her gender. I\u2019m getting up early tomorrow morning and voting in person for Harris in my \u201cthe future is female\u201d tee!",
         "You are definitely not overreacting. As a fellow woman who will likely face issues with childbirth due to various lifelong conditions that raise chances of complications and miscarriage. I 100% agree with you that if trump is elected that pregnancy will become way to dangerous in the United States. I mean because of him and the people he elected it is already too dangerous and there isn't an all out ban set everywhere yet. I mean an 18 year old girl recently died in Texas, she wasn't even looking for an abortion. She had recently had a gender reveal party. She just faced a miscarriage and complications but the doctors refused to help when she came in septic until they carried out TWO separate ultrasounds to make sure the fetus/baby was not viable/alive anymore.  And as such would not give her lifesaving treatment. Only after the two ultrasounds did they move her to icu where she died later. \n\nSo no, you are most definitely not overreacting. \nEven women in other countries have sworn to not travel to America if they are remotely suspecting they may be pregnant. Me included.\n\n(Edit to add the word not before overreacting in the last part of my comment)",
         "I was 25 when Trump got elected in 2016. I\u2019d been on the fence about kids, but watching him get elected that night 100% solidified my decision not to have kids. I don\u2019t think people understand how bad the country is ALREADY fucked from his first presidency. Things are never going to be the same as they were pre-Trump, it can\u2019t bounce back. Like we can nominate Democrats for the next 50 years and I intend to vote for every one of them, but the Supreme Court isn\u2019t going anywhere and what the Republican party turned into, who they showed themselves to be, can not be reversed. \n\nSo I get it, because I felt that way in 2016 and I still feel that way, this is not a country I can ever feel good about bringing kids into.",
         "Unfortunately, not overreacting. I've lost five very wanted pregnancies and although we were lucky to not have complications, when there is an emergency, it happens fast. There is not time to get yourself across the border, unless you're lucky enough to live right next to it, and even then, that's a gamble. Thousands of birthing people will die under Trump every year if he is elected. Ultimately, I think that's their goal. Women who are scared, sick, and dying don't wield a lot of political power. Giving birth in the United States is already more dangerous than in most developed nations, and under Trump's abortion bans, no state will be safe. It's a very sad, infuriating, and just fucked up situation and I'm sorry you're needing to make decisions within it. Let's hope tomorrow brings some better news!",
         "You should be scared. I\u2019m scared. \u00a0\n\nI am currently recovering from a miscarriage. Like all my previous miscarriages, I hemorrhaged terribly and lost a shit ton of blood. When nurses and doctors are visibly freaked out by the amount of bleeding, that\u2019s when you know it\u2019s bad. \u00a0\n\nMy severe, life-threatening bleeding was slowed by a vacuum aspiration procedure. Essentially, the uterus keeps contracting as long as there is tissue in the uterus, which is bad if you are bleeding uncontrollably. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhat I had is considered an abortion procedure. The same procedure that is banned or very very hard to get in many US states. In fact, in many of these states I would have been denied care at the ER at all, even as I was bleeding out. I would have been told, as many women in similar positions have, to wait until my condition worsens. Sometimes, these women are actively miscarrying in their cars parked outside so they are close enough to get care when they are finally half-dead.\u00a0\n\nYou should be scared. We should all be scared. If Trump gets elected, considering my condition, I am not having any more babies for at least four more years because I could FUCKING DIE. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nLast bit: in some cases, I could have even faced criminal charges for having a miscarriage. There is no medical indication whether a miscarriage is random or intentional. None. They have no way of knowing. So just keep that in mind too.\u00a0",
         "I know 5 women who would under these laws would have died.  Malformed uterus/bleeding, ectopic, organ shut down, dead fetus. YOU ARE NOT OVER REACTING!",

         "As a non-American I can only say what you are potentially facing in this election is truly horrifying.  You are absolutely not overreacting.\n\nPregnancy can and does kill women.  Access to appropriate healthcare is what saves their lives.  It\u2019s completely rational to not want to take the risk of pregnancy when there is a non-zero chance you could have complications for which you might be denied said life saving healthcare.\n\nI\u2019m hoping sanity rules in your country for the election.  Harris appears capable, competent and strong.  I hope that\u2019s as clear to the majority of voters in your country as it is to those of us on the outside looking in.",
         "I'm never planning to have children nor ever having sex yet the abortion ban still scares the shit out of me. What if someone forces himself on me at one point and now I'm pregnant and can't abort...\u00a0that's one of my greatest fears \ud83d\ude2d",
         "You\u2019re not overreacting. I live in Texas. My husband and I are so lucky to have our daughter and we were thinking about another, but it has been put on hold because of our state\u2019s draconian laws and staggering maternal mortality rates. \n\nI have a responsibility to be here for my daughter and the risks are currently too high for us.",
         "You are not overreacting. \n\nTrigger warning \u26a0\ufe0f \n\nI had a miscarriage of a planned and wanted pregnancy before Roe was overturned. I started to bleed out on my bathroom floor. My husband managed to get me to the hospital in around twenty minutes, and in that time my blood had soaked through a huge pad, two full size beach towels, and was pooling on the car floor and leather seat. I could feel myself getting colder and weaker with every heartbeat, and it was so scary to think my toddler could end up facing life without me. \n\nMy life was saved by an emergency D&C, aka an abortion. \n\nI\u2019ve had folks suggest that I could have simply driven to a state where abortion is legal, had this happened after Roe was overturned. I live over two hours from any other state, and I almost didn\u2019t survive the twenty minute race to the closest hospital. If I had needed to wait for paperwork and red tape, I would be dead. \n\nWhat is happening with women\u2019s healthcare in the United States is barbaric and inhumane. Many more women will die preventable deaths.",
         "You're not overreacting.  My wife lost a child to miscarriage 20 years ago and she had to have a D & C in the hospital.  We lived in NY at the time, but we live in purple PA now and I wonder if it happened here during a second Trump presidency (vomited in my mouth writing that), would my wife be able to have the D & C or would she have to wait and possibly be on death's door before the doctors could do anything.  Or would she die from sepsis.  I worry now for my children and grandchildren.  It's such a scary time.  And I really can't believe that some people are so ignorant that they support his policies.  Or don't care enough.\n\nStay strong and encourage everyone you know to vote.  This is the only way we will make this nation safe for our children and grandchildren.",

         "You aren\u2019t overreacting at all; this is a matter of life and death. If the rest of the US goes the way of Texas, your life will not be a priority if you\u2019re carrying a child.",

         "I think any risk is currently unacceptable. Any risks, that arise from medically professionals not being able to provide care. I would not get pregnant now, as I live in Georgia.",
         "I have no desire to attempt to have children if I cannot freely access healthcare. You are wise, not overreacting.",
         "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re overreacting at all. My husband and I are wanting to try for a second child sometime next year, and I\u2019m terrified of any potential nationwide abortion bans being passed because I suffered from a ruptured ectopic pregnancy two years ago and now I\u2019m at an increased risk for another ectopic (about 10% chance). If Trump gets elected, I\u2019m thinking about trying for a baby sooner just so I can get through that risky period before an abortion ban could pass.\u00a0",
         "Not overreacting and unfortunately with all the right wing fundamentalist freaks appointed by Trump, we\u2019re not going to be safe just cause loses either.",
         "The stress from having possibly having Trump as president again is enough to screw up my health and keep me up at night.",
         "No you are not overreacting. I was 7 weeks pregnant when Roe fell and my state immediately implemented a trigger law from the 1800s before they voted to ban abortion almost entirely. I ended up having complications that put my pregnancy in the high risk category right when my state banned abortion. Thankfully I made it to 40 weeks and my son is healthy, but I cannot go through that stress again so he will not have a sibling.",
         "That\u2019s definitely not an overreaction: there are many things which can go wrong during pregnancy where you don\u2019t want a religious tribunal deciding whether doctors can try to save your life, and parenting is hard unless you\u2019re very rich, and Republicans have and promise to continue cutting programs which help parents.\u00a0\n\nIf you have relatives who aren\u2019t diehard Harris supporters, consider letting them know how this is stressing you. A lot of the war on women has depended on republican-leaning voters saying they won\u2019t do things they tried to do (repeal the ACA) or did (Dobbs), or rationalizing that it won\u2019t affect them (thinking of that horror story with that woman in Texas who self-described as an abortion opponent). Piercing the veil of ignorance isn\u2019t easy but it might be necessary.\u00a0",
         "I would not be having a baby in these current times. Even if you make it through pregnancy, what kind of rights will your child have?\n\nI'm so worried about not only myself, but my daughter if he were to be in power. The idea of any of the things happening to her that he is discussing makes me want to wrap her up and bubble wrap forever.",
         "i'm a queer woman who has vowed to not date men if trump wins the election. i am not risking my autonomy to be forced into childbirth. not overreacting",
         "In their last attempt to outlaw the so called abortion pill nation wide, the scotus found, the dark money group 'lacked standing'. It was surprising to many at the time, after scotus has handed down so many rulings contradicting the will of the people.\n\nThe standing (harm) they're claiming now is \"[not enough teen pregnancies](https://newrepublic.com/post/187326/new-abortion-pill-mifeprisone-lawsuit-teenagers-pregnant)\". The link to the 200 page filing is in the article. For the nationalists, it's at least partially about 'replacement theory'. ( ie, not enough white babies and too many non-white babies) It's ugly stuff that they've been pushing for decades (also used as justification in mid-century Germany).\n\nIt's about punishing women. They've spent billions and decades framing abortion as 'birth control for loose women'. They believe it's their religious duty to force you to follow their religious beliefs, even if it kills you.",
         "Women are dying in Ears from easily avoidable and treatable things, simply because staff are terrified to touch a pregnant woman in many states.\n\nSo I doubt I will get pregnant any time soon.",
         "26F here- I'm already iffy about having kids, but it's an absolute no for me under any Republican government. I live in a red state and really can't risk it.\n\nMy main concern at this point is birth control access. I'm not sexually active, but my birth control is life-saving care due to my terrible hormonal mood swings and PMDD. It does more for my mental health than my other antidepressants, and without it, I don't think I'll make it.\n\nI don't think it's overreacting, as these are big health events and decisions that we don't have full control over because of our government. I'm recalling some conversation I saw online (so please call me out if this is misinformation!) that a Republican supermajority would be able to put through a national ban that would supersede a state's own laws. If abortions become illegal federally, it would become harder or impossible for blue states to remain safe havens for reproductive care.\n\nYour concerns are much more pressing because you're actively wanting to have children, and I'd fully agree with your decision to not have them under Trump. For my own personal life, I'm also terrified because abortion bans turn into other reproductive health bans. And if I can't get my birth control for hormonal therapy reasons, I'm toast.\n\nA Harris victory is a victory for reproductive care of all kinds. Here's hoping America shows up tomorrow.",
         "Having children ought to always be one of the most terrifying prospects imaginable. Parents give up their comfort and way of life to support a person they do not know, with problems they cannot expect. The fact that it is more terrifying with a radically conservative government only reinforces the fear that should be there. You're not overreacting.",
         "I got sterilized because people believe it\u2019s perfectly okay that the government can pass medical bans on my body and give more rights to an embryo/fetus then a living human. \n\nOverreacting? I don\u2019t think so. When there are states in 2024 that force rape victims to give birth, I\u2019m not taking any chances. Pregnancy fucked me up enough already.",
         "I got pregnant with my second just after Election Day in 2016. I often think that if we had waited until 2018, or hadn\u2019t already had one kid, then I wouldn\u2019t have made the decision to have kids.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Not just for my health, and not just for their bodily autonomy (I have two daughters), but also because I want them to be able to live whatever life they need to live without someone screaming about bathrooms.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0We moved to an exceptionally blue area (from Texas) in one of those states that puts tampons in all the school bathrooms. This has helped my general feelings, but it\u2019s not as though this blue bubble protects them from the world.\u00a0",

         "You are not overreacting. I\u2019m almost past childbearing years but I\u2019ve never had to use birth control and I don\u2019t want to start now.\n\nHowever, if conservatives shut down women\u2019s health care, I want a permanent solution already in place for myself.",
         "My wife and I have had this discussion too. It's sad because we want kids very much but are both scared about her health if something goes wrong. We've already done two rounds of IVF as well and are scared that our options are going dissappear.",
         "Not overreacting at all. My republican MIL often nags us about grandkids, but I don't feel same becoming pregnant in today's climate. I vote for Harris for myself, but more importantly, for any person who may need reproductive care. We deserve better than this fucked up situation that donald and his cronies put us in.",
         "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re overreacting. I also live in a heavily blue state. In 2007 I had an ectopic pregnancy. It was possibly one of the worst experiences of my life and I wouldn\u2019t wish it on my worst enemy. I received appropriate medical care and they saved my tube. If that had happened now in a different state I might not be writing this now.",
         "All of my friends say the same. They won\u2019t have more kids or even have their first child if he\u2019s elected. I have a son & I refuse to die due to possible pregnancy complications & leave him. It is not an overreaction as they\u2019ve proven over & over again what matters & it isn\u2019t the health of women.",
         "You are not overreacting, unfortunately. 34f here and just discussed this with my husband this weekend. We truly want to be parents and have a family, but if trump is elected we will not be having kids. I can\u2019t risk my health, my life. They don\u2019t care about me. My government would rather I bleed out and die than help me. And I simply cannot raise a child in this world knowing they will have less rights that I have now. \n\nIf trump wins, motherhood is no longer an option for me. My husband and I are voting BLUE in Pennsylvania tomorrow!!",
         "I'm not saying this to scare you, but I am sharing this for women in this sub that were leaning towards voting Trump.\n\nTwo things are going to happen under him, and this is realistic, because it's already in progress judicially at state government levels. The Trump admin will use the Comstock act to ban the mailing of mifepristone in the United States but also from international locations; it would be illegal and seized. My state of Tennessee has been exploring avenues to ban mifepristone being sent in the mail, so this is a Republican initiative. \n\nTrump has talked about who he will appoint and he has plans to appoint someone that not only guts the FDA, but that could successfully make mifepristone illegal to be used for abortions. This would effectively make medical abortion unobtainable in every state. \n\nBetween these two routes, abortion will basically be illegal federally - without ever having had to sign a bill. So even though Trump said he wouldn't sign a bill, that doesn't matter and was likely never the goal.\n\nNo state will be safe and even if a state has abortion constitutionally enshrined, if mifepristone is illegal to be mailed or to be used for abortion, medical abortion will not be obtainable anywhere, only surgical abortion, which severely limits protected states to offer the procedure in a timely manner. This means women who should have had access to an abortion in the first trimester won't have it because of wait times at the very small amount of clinics that even still offer abortion.\n\nThis isn't even taking into consideration miscarriage care if fetal tissue is retained and there's no access to mifepristone. If abortion is not accessible, a retained miscarriage would result in sepsis. Sepsis leads to severe injury and death.\n\nI'm not fear mongering, I'm telling you in stark reality what the future will look like. Vote responsibily and accordingly.",

         "You have legitimate fears. I would wait and see how things play out too. Hopefully it will work out well, but better safe than sorry. It\u2019s truly sad America\u2019s intelligence about reproductive healthcare is so bad in 2024. And it\u2019s depressing that so many people are wanting an utterly vile person to govern them. Hopefully intelligence and empathy will prevail.",
         "If Trump is elected, I will never have sex with anyone without a vasectomy AND a condom ever again.  And I won\u2019t touch a man who voted for Trump with a ten foot pole.  Let\u2019s all band together and force all men who voted for Trump to be incels.",

It\u2019s not just Trump and the abortion debacle that makes it terrifying to be a parent.  I look at my 12 year old and worry all of the time about what the world will look like when she is my age.

         "Lol I gave up on having kids forever ago. I'm 33, and I will likely never own my own home. Even if I could, the world is burning. What kind of world will they inherit from us? Nuclear war?

I had been dealing with some health issues that we wanted to make sure were under control before we started trying and now that we are ready we decided to wait and see how the election goes, especially since I would now be considered an \"older\" pregnancy, which increases risk of complications. Neither of us want to put my life at risk just to have a baby.\n\nIt's so frustrating to finally be ready both financially and health-wise, only for the political climate to have become so hostile toward the safety of women.",

I always felt comfortable relying on long term birth control until now.\n\nI know it's a hard conversation to have, but I'm glad you and your partner have discussed and decided what you will do. \n\nWomen should have free choice over if and when they want to have children. I'm sorry that the current political environment exists which is preventing people from feeling comfortable to make decisions on their own timeline.\n\nEven with my bisalp (which is as virtually 100% sterile as possible), I kept my IUD in because I am taking absolutely *zero* chances. \n\nHoping for you and all our other sisters' sake that tomorrow is a day we can all breathe a sigh of relief.",

We\u2019re scared of the same things you are - that my life would be at risk if we do try to start a family and have complications, that I might face legal consequences (prison, court, etc) if we have a miscarriage or stillborn, and that I may not have consistent access to my birth control which keeps my endometriosis symptoms manageable and allows us to family plan on our own timeline without sacrificing intimacy in our relationship. \n\nI'm angry that I feel like I have to alter my life plans to feel safe while living in (what I've been raised to believe is) the \"greatest\" first world country on Earth. I'm scared that my life could be at risk. I'm anxious that waiting too long could affect our ability to have multiple healthy children. \n\nYou're not alone.",

I know places like NYS (who's constitution also is supposed to protect our rights like USA constitution) is get a further addition to make it extremely clear what the constitution already protected. We still have the right to vote, for now, so use it!\n\nI'm happy you have good husband that will work for you as every husband should. I have heard so many stories of... oh my.",

I\u2019m stuck in a deep red state but financially privileged enough that we *could* flee the state if medically necessary to save my life\u2026 but what if there isn\u2019t enough time for that? What if the laws change and I could be prosecuted for that? What if doctors withhold information that delays me being able to leave and seek that help?",

Idk what we will do if things increase another 10 percent let alone another 20 to 40 percent predicted under trumps plan.\n\nThis is what capitalism is unfortunately, the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. Everything is catered to the top 10 percent, that's what It means. It sucks",

Women were lead to believe pregnancy is a neutral healthy thing your body does, as in it is designed to do it and you will do it without any complications, which is absolutely not true!  A LOT of things can go wrong and you need to be able to trust your doctor to make the right decision for YOUR. health.\n\nI live in a country where abortion is banned, but if my life was on the line it is one of the few situations where it is legal and i know most doctors would do it without thinking to save my life.",

We have a savings for emergencies and unfortunately if I got pregnant before those two things happened, that would qualify as an emergency and we would travel out of state to do what we needed to. \n\nIf at all possible, I suggest every woman who lives in a red state to save money just in case you need to travel for emergency healthcare, and to explore long-term birth control options such as the arm implant and copper or hormonal IUD asap just in case they try to ban those too. \n\nYou can also visit https://www.ineedana.com to find organizations that will help you travel out of state and/or get in contact with other organizations who can discreetly mail the pills to women who live in places with abortion bans.\n\n\nMore resources:\n\nhttps://www.plancpills.org\n\nhttps://www.mahotline.org\n\nhttps://abortionfunds.org\n\nhttps://prochoice.org/patients/naf-hotline/",

Scared for my young daughter\u2019s future.",

I was perfectly healthy before that. So no, you're not overreacting. If my kids hadn't already been born before COVID and before Roe was overturned, I wouldn't have had children at all.",

And they get some kind of $1000/mo kid bonus thing ot help with expenses.  And, socieity over there is less hardcore hustle oriented.

         "Same\u2014live in a red state and found out that I have a gene that makes me more likely to miscarry. The same lifesaving care that was available to my mother 30+ years ago when she had an ectopic pregnancy would not be as accessible.",
         "I want to have kids more than anything in this world. Since I was a child the only thing I\u2019ve wanted is to be a mom. But I don\u2019t just want to be a mom, I want to go through pregnancy and childbirth, and be able to nurse my children. I suffered two miscarriages this year, while they were absolutely devastated and I have still not emotionally recovered from them I was incredibly lucky from a medical standpoint that the miscarriage were simple and the babies passed without medical intervention. If trump gets elected tomorrow I will not have children, because I may not be as lucky next time if I have another miscarriage and if I can\u2019t get the help I could need I can die. I cannot take that risk.",
         "I had this discussion with my husband over the weekend. We really want kids but after 4 miscarriages, if Trump wins the risk on my life is too great. It's such a sad reality- I can't understand how people don't see that a ban on abortion would even make those who want to be parents hesitant to try.",
         "Not overreacting. I had an ectopic pregnancy in 2007 in Texas. I got the surgery done in Texas. My OBGYN sent me straight to the ER. There was no question about what had to be done.\n\nI'm 42 now and done having kids. Because I had an ectopic pregnancy before, I am much more likely to have another one than other women.\n\nIf Trump gets elected, I will go straight to my OBGYN and get a new IUD. And then pray I hit menopause in the next 7 years (that's how long IUDs last). I cannot risk birth control being \"outlawed\" or being more regulated than they already are.\n\nI feel sorry for younger women and fear for my children.",

I never thought I\u2019d have to teach my children to not look up to a president. In fact, I had to teach him to not ever be that way and to use the president as an example of what not to do and who not to be.",
         "I feel this in my bones. I have been with my husband for 12 years. We have stable jobs, a house, and live in a great location. We have been trying to have kids for the last 4 years. I have PCOS. The next step is IVF. I live in a red state. I want more than anything to have a kid but I am also leaning towards not having kids if he wins. It is not an easy decision or one that happens lightly.",
         "You're not overreacting at all. The more laws put on the practice of medicine over gynecology and obstetrics is going to make more doctors leave that branch of medicine, and overtime, there's going to be less doctors interested in such a restrictive and heavy legislated area of medicine. So there will likely be less and less specialists in OB/GYN, and the ones that do remain will have so many patients it will be hard to get to serve them all.

One Trumper tried to run my husband down with his big ugly Ram truck. Told him to go back home. Literally 3 feet from our driveway.

         "I have 3 children, one is non-binary born female, and I'm terrified for them as I am living in Texas. I am watching countless news stories of women dying from sepsis because doctors can not remove unborn fetuses from their wombs when the fetus has clearly died to begin with. This isn't the country my grandfather fought for, this isn't the world women advocates fought so hard for. We're going back in time and it's horrific.",
         "I wouldn\u2019t have them due to the climate disaster we are facing anyway, just look at all the alarm bells science is sounding and no government is doing a thing about it. It\u2019s accelerating as well. It\u2019s cruel to bring children into the world at this point imo.",
         "Did you feel this way 4 years ago when he was president? Yall acting like he\u2019s never been in office. Abortions won\u2019t be banned he\u2019s said repeatedly that\u2019s not going to happen and it couldn\u2019t happen anyway- the house would have to pass it and it\u2019ll never pass. It\u2019s with the states. Definitely overreacting. You\u2019ll be fine.",
         "My suggestion is- after the election, have a serious discussion with your gynecologist. I had the same fears living in a red state, but my gynecologist said \"I don't like these laws, and I'm not afraid of getting sued. I'm always going to prioritize your life.\" And that's enough for me honestly",

         "You are not overreacting. I am a married gay man and even I would not have children if I still lived in the US.\n\nI don\u2019t want my children to grow up in a society where there is so much rampant misogyny and toxic masculinity that damage both genders. They will have to deal with the climate crisis that previous generations created. And they will be paying off their student loans for most of their lives.\n\nIf we can\u2019t make sure our children do better than we did, we shouldn\u2019t make them suffer.",

I don't want to waste my 30s with Trump and I really hope that Kamala wins. If Trump wins I'll probably be childless because the next 4 years are the only ones that I will probably be fertile for.",
         "Definitely not an over reaction.  I'm well past my child bearing years but I have a daughter, daughter-in-laws and 4 granddaughters to be concerned about.  Roe v. Wade needs to be reinstated for safety's sake.  There can not be any restriction, especially time restrictions because any complication can arise in pregnancy at any time.  There are always going to be women who seek abortion to end a pregnancy whether it's legal or not.  But it's the medical need part of this that has become the issue.  I foresee the birth rate in this country declining very quickly in this country if God forbid, Trump is elected and I totally understand.  I would do everything in my power to prevent a pregnancy until Roe v. Wade is reinstated and women can be assured that they are safe.",

         "I think you have every right to be afraid to get pregnant if Trump is elected. I live in Indiana, where we have a near total abortion ban. If you live here & have an ectopic pregnancy,  there's no guarantee that the doctors won't refuse to remove the tube. There's plenty of stories of women being denied care until they're deathly ill. In one instance,  the pregnant mother died, unfortunately.  We just can't be sure how far republicans will go to strip women's reproductive rights away.",
         "I'm so glad I got my tubes tied. I had a really rough 2nd pregnancy and I cannot imagine going through that level of uncertainty under MAGA rule. I'd rather live my life childless than die trying to look like the sort of person MAGA wants women to be. I choose me, thanks.",
         "You\u2019re not overreacting.\n\nIf anything: I would add another reason why I\u2019d be worried about having kids if Trump wins, which is that I don\u2019t know if this is a world to bring kids into. Rapidly intensifying climate change, possibly living under authoritarian rule \u2013 it\u2019s very frightening.",
         "No, you\u2019re not overreacting and if you have any family members who are voting for republicans, you can tell them this in hopes of making it real for them and maybe either staying home or switching to voting for democrats!!",
         "You are NOT overreacting. You have many fertile years left, so you can definitely sit out a Trump term if you need to. You never know when a complication might occur. Even in the best of situations, pregnancy is hard on the body. If a problem arises, it needs to be addressed quickly. You could try to live abroad while you are pregnant, and your kid might even get dual citizenship if your adopted country has birthright citizenship!",
         "You are not overreacting.  Your concerns are perfectly valid.",
         "I\u2019m currently pregnant and I\u2019m very nervous, but for a slightly different reason - I am having a daughter. I do not want to raise a daughter under his \u201cadministration\u201d if we can even call it that. I am in a blue state, and any major bans are unlikely to go into affect before she is born but I genuinely think if they did I would leave the country. \n\nI have dual citizenship with an EU country and my husband and I have seriously discussed leaving if we need to. Even my father, who was once so proud and happy to achieve citizenship in the US, has pressured me to make sure my EU passport is up to date. One of the first things I will be doing is getting my daughter on the foreign birth registry of my country so that she can have both passports as well. I even found a flight that lets dogs on board (K9 jets) so they don\u2019t have to go in with the luggage. It feels craaaaazy to be planning like that but honestly\u2026it\u2019s necessary.\n\nYou are not alone and you are not crazy. I would argue that you are actually very smart and making these kinds of plans is extremely important.",
         "Same. I will not get pregnant if Trump becomes president. It\u2019s too scary and risky.",

         "Not only the abortion ban issues but if Trump is elected all government attempts to tackle climate change will end. What kind of world would your children be inheriting?",
         "From my understanding. It isn't up to Kamala either, even if she wins office - she can't change anything anyway. The Supreme Court already ruled that this is a state level issue. The president can not overturn a Supreme Court decision. Kamala can not change it even if she wanted. Trump cannot make it a national ban, even if he wanted. Neither can overrule the Supreme Court, which deemed it up to the states. \n\nJust some food for thought for this election cycle. You're not overreacting, and your feelings are valid. However, I feel it's important for people to realize this isn't a presidential decision anymore, unfortunately. Nothing is going to change from how things are currently deemed.",
         "You\u2019re not overreacting. Also, it\u2019s your life and your body. Even if the entire rest of the world doesn\u2019t think that\u2019s a good enough reason to avoid pregnancy, if it\u2019s a reason YOU don\u2019t want to become pregnant then that\u2019s significant enough. You still have plenty of time before it\u2019s medically hazardous due to age complications. My advice to everyone who could potentially get pregnant is not to get pregnant unless they\u2019re completely sure they want to be pregnant and have a child. Take whatever precautions you need to and remember to investigate drug interactions with birth control if you\u2019re using that since many substances can reduce it\u2019s effectiveness",

Not sure why they\u2019re pushing that narrative.\nI\u2019m not a fan Roe v Wade is gone, but all he did was push it to the states to vote on it.\nHowever, economically, it\u2019s $1.5k-$3k/mo to have 1 child in childcare now. I\u2019m pretty worried about that.",

For her, though, it's a huge deal. She has ALWAYS wanted to be a mom. She would be devastated if it never happened. So we've started trying despite the uncertainty of the future. We also live in a blue state where women can seek medical care and abortions.\n\nMy wife also travels for work fairly often; at least twice a month. One of the places she regularly has to travel to is Texas. I was browsing reddit the other day when a thought occurred to me.\n\nShould she get pregnant, there is a high chance she will have to travel to Texas during that time. There is a non-zero chance she could experience complications while in Texas. There is a non-zero chance those complications could be life-threatening. There is a non-zero chance she could be refused the medical care that she needs while in Texas. There is a non-zero chance either her, the baby, or both could die due to the complications and lack of medical care because she couldn't get out of that state in time. The chance is small, but the fact that it's a non-zero chance in the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA is repugnant.\n\nDoesn't matter that we're from a blue state. If something happens while she's there, Texas law is what matters.  If it were up to me, I would be doing exactly what you're doing: Waiting to see who gets elected and refusing to have children if it's Trump.

         "I get MSNBC on the radio - I'm not sure who was talking, but they said that although the narrative for a lot of people was that there wasn't a blue wave in 2022 midterms.  HOWEVER, this person said that was a false narrative that the GOP are pushing - it wasn't a blue wave on ELECTION NIGHT, but when the final results came in, it was.  People just didn't pay attention like we do in Presidential election years.  \n\nIt was all about that state's method of counting - they rediculously count the in person votes first - even though the mail in ballots could immediately be at least PREPPED before the election.  I believe mine are tabulated (I'm in a vote by mail state) but no one can see the results until 8 PM election night.\n\nWell, especially in 2020 and 2022, a LOT of Dems voted by mail - so essentially the in person votes skewed heavily to GOP.  I believe that is why a lot of people are doing in person early voting in key states.   In a couple of states they changed how they count (VBM isn't delayed)\n\nSo - when you consider THAT plus the fact that many are reporting that women would be nervous to answer a poll that they are voting for Harris because they don't want their husbands or fathers to know - places like Texas and Florida COULD BE IN PLAY.\n\nI am hoping for a Reagan - Mondale blowout, with the winner Harris.

I had to explain to him that women\u2019s sizes were ALREADY smaller than men\u2019s and we don\u2019t have to skew the sizes\u2014the size difference is already configured in the women\u2019s cut, and likely to an exaggerated degree. If we skew our order towards smaller sizes, when they are already smaller, we\u2019ll end up unable to serve women needing larger sizes at all. To make my point I let him know I wear an XL in most women\u2019s styles which completely surprised him. (I\u2019m a 14/16 size) It was clear that he only interprets the size of a woman in relation to the size of a man, and it really took some mental gymnastics for him to understand that women vary in size compared with on other women, even if on average they may be a little smaller. He thinks of me as \u201csmall\u201d, but I\u2019m average\u2014and in the world of women\u2019s clothing size, I\u2019m fucking huge.\n\nHe listened to me and followed my suggestions, but man is it frustrating to, once again, encounter man-as-default. The website we\u2019re using has a category for \u201cAdult Apparel\u201d with all male models, and a category for \u201cWomen\u2019s Apparel\u201d.

Some of us aren't small at all (me, and the other 99th percentile height ladies) If the average height for women is about 5'3\", and the average clothing size is 14/16, and the average shoe size is 9, women's bodies are NOT on average built like fragile little dolls. Even small women are not actually as small as men think. The small to average height majority apparently often takes the same size i do at 6', for 14/16 to be the average size in the US. That's the size I take too, but I'm long/tall length. We have fat and muscle and boobies hips and curves, or literally large bones, or prefer loose fit...all kinds of reasons to need that 'large' (really average) sizes. Give us our damn XLs lol. But also still get an appropriate # of small sizes because there are some women who are built short + petite, they are just not the majority/average! \nI sell clothes & shoes and my best sellers are 14-16, XL & XXL, and shoes in 9-11.

Absolutely! And they also struggle to find clothing that works for them. That's absolutely a thing. I rarely see petite sizes in store and even if they are, there's still folks who need smaller sizes.\n\nThen there's plus sizes. Many places don't even offer plus sizes. \n\nWork apparel is horrible for this! We just got a notification about ordering new sweaters and I had to specifically request a men's sweater. The women's only goes up to an XL which is really not an XL. And I'm a size 20-24, so an XL won't fit. \n\nEven if I lose weight, I am broad shouldered. My shoulders won't shrink, they're wide.

Unisex sizes only really work for women who are on the smaller end and not as curvy since shirts tend to be longer and cut straight so if you have any kind of hip it looks ridiculously tight across the tummy/hip area.

I saw him on my way to the bus stop, and he tried to grab me, but he had no idea what kind of wild bitch I am, so he ended up running away.  \nAnyway, I called the police, and when they arrived, one of the officers took my statement. He never asked about my height or weight, but when he gave me the paper to sign, I noticed he had put my height at 5'2\" and my weight at 120. I understand the height discrepancy because, even though I'm only 5', I tend to look taller. However, I was around 145-150 lbs back then.  \nBefore I could mention my actual weight, the other officer asked me something, so I signed the paper and handed it back. Later that day, as I was reading the copy they gave me, I kept dwelling on the weight thing. I had never interacted with the police like that before, so I didn\u2019t know how things worked. I kept thinking that maybe my weight wasn\u2019t that important, but there's a reason they have that section. Why not ask instead of just writing whatever?  \nAt first, I thought the officer might be one of those men who believe that 120 lbs is heavy for a woman, so he saw that I wasn\u2019t skinny and thought, \u201c120 it is.\u201d However, whenever I share my weight with men (I\u2019m into weightlifting and strength training), they never believe me when I tell them I\u2019m usually between 155-160 lbs.

We have been discussing my need for more of the aftercare surrounding our kink sessions, and that he keeps falling asleep on me, and if my needs aren\u2019t met there, I can\u2019t continue the kink with him. He was confused as to how a \u201cvanilla\u201d for us act (me performing oral, while he called me a $/ut and a wh0r\u20ac, an act that I absolutely consent to in the lead up to and during a kink session.), was actually kinky and requiring aftercare. I had to explain to him that, while he views them as terms of endearment for me, they are very degrading terms, and I need the reassurance and care afterwards. I watched the lightbulb come on when he realized that these terms had been used against me as an insult by pathetic people from the time I was 12, and that they did come with a sting. \n\nI\u2019m glad we were able to have the conversation, and I think that things will get better from here.

         "Lol yep people always assume I\u2019m much taller than I actually am because I\u2019m thin and lanky. They add an extra 2-4\u201d \u2026even when I am standing next to them",
         "Haha SAME, everyone always thinks I'm a couple inches taller than I am. I just assume I have Tall Person Energy (which is fine, I've always wanted to be taller than I am anyway.)\n\nBut yeah, it's really difficult to correctly estimate people's weight just by looking, especially if they have a bunch of muscle, because that shit is a lot heavier than it looks like! Plus people just carry their weight very differently from each other, and clothing/presentation makes a huge difference too.",

         "Same with rings. They're... all circles?",
         "On the subject of shoes, I am on the smaller size for a man's shoe but in women's I'm generally like one half size too large for the largest size most shops in my city carry in-store. They're always telling me to go online when I ask for a shoe in my size. It is so gd frustrating. I sometimes end up having to go to the men's to find the nicest looking style, which is normally a disappointment. And I don't even have large feet.",
         "So I have giant feet, and often have to resort to mens shoes, and there's a huge difference in fit. Mens shoes are always too wide (to be fair, so are womens shoes on me, I'm a 43 extra extra narrow, and no, i have never had a single pair of heels that fits), but specifically they tend to be wider at the heel and have a higher toe box. I'm not sure the difference in shoe shape actually corresponds to a difference in foot shape across genders, but there certainly is one in shoes.",

         "They also get confused regarding proportions relative to height. I\u2019m fairly tall for a woman, so my L/XL looks proportional and not that \u201cbig.\u201d\n\nMen tend to be shocked that I\u2019m close to being \u201cplus sized.\u201d",
         "I mostly shop online bc I'm lazy. My HUGE annoyance is with stores that, instead of giving you sizing based on actual body measurements, try to ~anticipate~ your size by asking you to tell them the size you \"usually wear\", or ask for the size you wear in a different store's clothing. It's absolute nonsense and at this point just seems like a way to trick consumers into giving them market data. Just give me the actual size of the damn shirt in inches or centimetres so I can see if it will fit on my body, goddamn.",

         "Exactly. This is what I was trying to explain to my boss\u2014bc the sizing is already smaller, the distribution should look about the same as the men\u2019s. A few small, a few more medium, mostly lg, xl and xxl, a few xxxl, and a couple xxxxl if they have them (they don\u2019t often). \n\nIt\u2019s the sort of narrow-sightedness that makes life freaking hard for women average size or larger.",

         "It's not about making claims about big boobs skinny frame, it's about whether the bea is actually a supportive garment or not. If you're comfortable and don't want real support, then it's fine to wear a looser band! But support needs to come from below, so from the band, not the straps, and that's when a proper fit matters (think how, like, flip flops can be too big but work fine, but not true of a hiking boot). I think everyone deserves to know, since too many don't (I didn't for too long) but it's all about personal comfort in the end.",

She ended it with \"I pray that you will make the right decision tomorrow\". \n\nAll I could do was nod and say that I'm sure I will...

She said even before the 2020 election was that her biggest fear would be to se Roe overturned in her lifetime - the passage of Roe happened in the middle of her career, so she knew first hand what it meant. \n\nFortunately/unfortunately she passed away before that actually happened, so she\u2019s been weighing heavily on my mind lately. I\u2019m glad she\u2019s not here to know what\u2019s happening, but I also know she would want her voice heard. \n\nAunt J, I will make you proud and I hope the rest of our country does too.",

I'll my best to keep it simple.\n\nSo, my parents are divorced, and I live with my dad, and my mom doesn't have any custody. But, my dad has been letting me see her without him there a couple times a month since I became a teenager.\n\nI know and heard that she wasn't great back then, but I thought it was pretty cool to hang out with her like friends even though my dad says my mom is just acting liks a cool mom because she doesn't want any actual responsibilities of being a parent.\n\nBut anyways, awhile ago, my mom suddenly brought an adult toy and gave to me saying it's time for me to have this and start exploring. And, she wanted to talk about boys or some other things. I thought it was awkward and embarrassing and I didn't really know what to do, but my mom wanted to ask and talk about things saying it was like a mother and daughter kind of moment, so I kind of went with it. And later, she told me that it was a secret and I shouldn't tell dad.\n\nSo, I went home and didn't really say anything to dad, and I just hid that toy in my closet.\n\nAnd after that, mom bought me like thongs or other revealing undies a couple times, but since I don't wear those yet and since they were weirdly expensive, I didn't know what to do, so I hid them in the closet too (sorry it's getting longer. I'll try to wrap it up).\n\nAnd a few days ago, my dad found those in my closet and got really mad and started asking where I got them and if I use them and all. I told him everything, and he kept asking more and I answered them all even though it was embarrassing because he was really upset and I didn't want to get in trouble or put my mom in more trouble.\n\nThen, after all that, my dad said my mom was out of line and he won't let her see me. And, he told me I can't talk to her until he tells me I can, and he will talk to my mom about this.\n\nI feel like I really messed up, and I feel like maybe I should told him right away when those happened or just threw things away, or something.\n\nAnd I feel bad, sad, and all, but I don't know how to fix this. And for a temporary measures, I'm not allowed to close my door, and he checks my phone.\n\nHow do I fix this? And, should I try to talk to my dad more about this? And, should I try to talk to mom or something? Please help.\n\nThank you for your advice, and I'm sorry that it ended up being long. \n\nEdit: Sorry, I'm 14.",

Mom buying a sex toy and thongs for say ......a 17 yr old; not terribly off the mark even if a bit awkward.\u00a0 But if you're 13-16, it comes off more like she is trying to push you into adulthood early so she has access your dad can't control.\u00a0",
         "With the context, it sounds like your mom's behavior made you embarrassed/uncomfortable and you didn't ask for it. I don't like that she told you to keep it a secret from your dad. I don't think it's your job to fix that either, don't worry. Your mom and dad's dynamic is completely not your responsibility. I'm sorry about the stress of this conflict though! Would you be willing to ask your Dad about therapy? 14 is a really important age and you deserve some quality, unbiased guidance.",
         "It is wildly inappropriate of your mother to have given you a sex toy and \"sexy\" underwear.  It is also inappropriate of your father to not allow you to close your door, but hopefully this will pass.  You didn't mess up, your parents did.  And of your parents, your mother is the most in the wrong here.  Your father is right to be concerned and to limit your mother's access to you.",
         "How old are you? It's weird in the way that I feel she's doing too much. It would be different if you went to her asking for those things. Also, it depends on your age how inappropriate these gifts are, and by that, I mean the severity of the inappropriateness.",
         "Umm..does mom have a BF? Cause I can see another red flag on the horizon..",
         "I think what really stands out to me is you didn't ask your mom for the toy. Its totally appropriate for a girl to have healthy talks with her mom. For example my mom talked a lot about her first boyfriend and how he made her feel safe and comfortable and asked her about what she liked and how he didn't pressure her. We had a lot of similar conversations.\n\nYour dad sounds like he is freaking out and he's doing it in an unhealthy way. Eventually you are going to grow up and it would be ideal if you could have constructive conversations about dating.\n\nIf you feel safe to do so ask your dad to have a conversation about what he's afraid of for you and try to open a line of communication. You deserve privacy.\n\nNone of this is on you",
         "OP, is there a trusted adult you can talk to that is not connected to your parents?\n\nFirst of all, it is extremely inappropriate of your mom to do this and is borderline grooming among other things.\u00a0\n\nYour dad violated your privacy by searching your bedroom and taking away your right to privacy by not letting you close your door. He is telling you that you cannot have a boundary with him and at 14, you should be able to have privacy. He has a serious control problem. Although, he is right in monitoring your communication with your mom.\n\nDo not reach out to your mom. She is not safe.\n\nI am sorry to say but you can\u2019t fix this. A lot of this is two adults who don\u2019t understand healthy boundaries for their teen. However *this is not your fault.* You did not ask for these things from your mom, she basically forced these on you. And your dad shouldn\u2019t be punishing you for what your mom did.\u00a0\n\nPlease reach out to a school counselor.",
         "The gifts from your mom are not age-appropriate and your dad is likely misdirecting anger and frustration he feels towards your mother towards you. What your mother did was very inappropriate. But that isn\u2019t your fault and you don\u2019t need to \u201cfix\u201d anything. Let your parents sort this out, that\u2019s their duty to you as the child. \n\nI would just suggest that you keep open communication with your dad. He seems like a good egg, and if things your mom (or any other adult) says or does make you feel uncomfortable, you can tell him about that rather than hiding them away in your closet.",
         "I\u2019d like to add that OP is very smart and resourceful to reach out to a safe group on Reddit. I have all the faith you will navigate this and make out a lot better than your parents did!",
         "OP, you are not in any way at all responsible for your dad being angry about this or your mom getting in trouble with him. Your mom buying these things for you at 14 is wholly inappropriate. She made the choices and she is responsible for the consequences. Your dad is angry because your mom, and adult, seems incapable of acknowledging that purchasing those things for you is not part of an age appropriate conversation with a child about sex. Your mom also telling you to keep it a secret from your dad, however, demonstrates that she does understand, even if she does not want to admit, that her actions were not okay. Clear and distinct boundaries need to exist between adults and children around sex. Your mom does not seem like an adult who is willing to honor and respect her role as a mother, not a friend or equal, in this matter.",
         "So, I watched the documentary on Jared from Subway, and there was a very similar story... a mom giving her kids sex toys and sexy underwear, except she also hid cameras in their room and sent the footage to Jared... please be careful. This gives me the heebie jeebies.",
         "My advice, based on how I parent my teens -\n\nIt was gross and inappropriate for your mom to buy you toys and sexy underwear. It was also gross and inappropriate for your dad to ask if you masturbate and to take your door away. \n\nYou haven't done *anything* wrong.\n\nTell your dad that you were really uncomfortable with the stuff your mom bought, but it was too embarrassing to tell him, that's why you hid it. Tell him you understand that he's trying to protect you, but asking you humiliating questions and punishing you by taking away your privacy made things worse and now you feel like you can't talk to him about anything. If he's a good dad he'll listen and admit that he overreacted.\n\nI do agree with him about limiting your contact with your mom. If a man bought his daughter those items it'd be grooming, 100%. He's scared for you. It can be a little different with moms & daughters, IF the mom's goal is to teach her daughter that sexuality is normal and healthy. Even then, though, it'd be more like \"When you're old enough, if you want to purchase things, go for it - it's normal and nothing to be ashamed of!\" Gifting your kid toys and lingerie isn't normal, and I've been there. My bio mom gave me stuff *for Christmas* when I was like 20. It was weird then and now I know it was super weird. I've had to set really firm boundaries with her for a lot of reasons.",
         "Just... wow. I am a teacher(that means I'm a mandated reporter), if a 14 year old student came to me saying their mom bought them a sex toy I would report it immediately. This is so inappropriate.\n\nYou did nothing wrong, this isn't your fault. Your father is angry and his reaction was not the best but I assume he is worried thinking about what else did your mom expose you to. \n\nPlease be careful around your mom. There is probably a good reason why she doesn't even have visitation rights. And always talk to your dad or another trusted adult if she keeps bringing up sex and giving you inappropriate gifts.",
         "I would ask if you can see a therapist.\n\nIf neither parent can be trusted, there might be a way of working out the no-door stuff with your father and therapist in the same room. It sounds like there's more to the story than you know, and a therapist might be able to help navigate that.",
         "Sorry but, mom buying all these adult items for a 14 year old is *really* skeevy and if I were your dad, I would've done the same thing (not the open door thing but I already check kid's phones). I think he has your best interests in mind, even if you can't see it now, you will understand later in life.",
         "Your father is overreacting. For him to deny you privacy over this is drastic overreach.\n\nConversely, with the context in comments that you're only 14 years old, it is very understandable *why* he is overreacting like this. He might sincerely think that this is how far he has to go to ensure that your mother doesn't persist or escalate in her blatantly inappropriate behaviour. Especially with the buying you sexy underwear - I could come up with some plausible well meaning reason to supply masturbation aids to a teenager if forced at literal rifle point, but expensive sexy underwear, absofuckinglutely not.\n\nYou have not fallen short of what is reasonable to expect of a literal child of your age faced with the situation you describe. It would probably have been appropriate for you to betray your mother's trust by telling your father about her inappropriate gifts, but it is not reasonable to expect a teenager to have the experience and cunning necessary to determine on their own when it is appropriate to betray their caregiver's trust.\n\nI think you need to unpack this with your father as soon as you're ready. Do not attempt to contact your mother behind his back under the circumstances. I do not possess the words to describe just how far out of line she is while maintaining a remotely calm tone.",
         "Your dad has good intentions, but he could have handled this a lot better. Here's what he didn't explain to you: \n\n1. You've done absolutely *nothing* wrong. You are a teenager that got sucked into a conflict between adults. You could not possibly have been expected to know the significance of hiding the items your mum gave you from your dad, especially because she \u2013 an adult that until now has been an authority figure \u2013 explicitly told you too. I would have done exactly the same in your position. It's understandable if you feel guilty, but please know that you don't *need* to feel guilty.   \n\n***\n\n\n2. Getting to know your body is perfectly normal at your age. Masturbation is a normal, healthy, private activity that no one else has any right to know anything about, and not something you should feel ashamed of. You never need to feel guilty about your body or your sexuality. That being said, \n\n***\n\n\n3. Your body and your sexuality are yours to explore and discover *on your own terms*. It is not okay for an adult to push you into topics or activities you don't feel comfortable with. You do not need to tell anyone anything about your sexuality, boys, girls, non-binary folks, your love life - unless there's an issue of safety or well-being. For example, if/ when you start having sex, it makes sense for you to discuss this with the adult(s) in your life you trust the most. That may or may not include your dad, teachers, or school councillors.\n\n***\n\n\n4. And just to be absolutely clear, **you've done absolutely nothing wrong**. These are things a reliable adult in your life should have already talked about. \n\n***\n\n5. Your mum is in the wrong here. Your dad is probably mad at her, and scared for your sake, and mad at himself for not doing more to protect you from sending up in this situation in the first place, and just doesn't know how to approach this. He's checking your phone to make sure she's not trying to reach out to you - although it's not clear that he's justified in making you keep your door open.\n\n***\n\n6. I would strongly recommend that you talk to your dad about seeing a therapist for yourself to work through what must be a very confusing and chaotic situation for you. See if he would be open to family therapy with just the two of you seeing a therapist together. If that's not an option, could you consider talking to a school councillor or another trusted adult at your school?",
         "This isn't your fault. Your mom is being WEIRD AS FUCK. Very inappropriate at your age, in my opinion. Your dad is probably just freaking out, bc this is kinda a big deal and really fucked up that your mom did that, so hopefully he'll calm down a little bit after a few days and when he's calm you migjt explain to him how uncomfortable it made you when she did that and that now you feel that you're at fault and see what he says",
         "Reading this and knowing your age scares me. Something is very wrong with mom. Her actions are not okay. \u00a0I say this as a sex positive person who understands teens have sexual urges. Your mom comes off like she is either trying to groom you for sexual contact (sell you for sex to someone) or has some weird psychological problem like she was repressed sexually as a young person and made to feel ashamed so she is overcompensating by introducing you to sexual things at an in appropriate age.\u00a0\n\nStay away from being alone with your mom. \u00a0Her actions are not appropriate. Also, it is extremely difficult to lose total custody of a child in the US. If your mom has lost custody then chances are very high her past actions were very bad. \u00a0\n\nYou can\u2019t fix your mom. You can\u2019t fix your dad\u2019s thoughts about your mom. \u00a0\n\nThe only thing you might be able to fix is your dad\u2019s thoughts about trusting you. \u00a0Tell him you didn\u2019t ask for that stuff and you were too embarrassed to show him and that\u2019s why you put it in the closet. That you realize now you should have gone to him no matter how embarrassing it was(fyi writing a letter or texting someone can help you say what is needed without having to be face to face with the person).\u00a0\nThat you would like to know more about your moms past history so you can know if this is one time incident or if she has a history of making bad decisions. Your mom need to be someone you love from a distance. Meaning your contact with her is limited for your own safety.\u00a0",
         "Whoa. Okay listen, my kid is AFAB and your same age. I\u2019ve had the sex talk with him multiple times and he knows about sex toys and such. But I would consider it out of line to buy one for him, that\u2019s a choice he can make on his own. You don\u2019t need toys to explore your sexuality, and while I can understand teaching about them or even potentially suggesting them one day, what she did is just \u2026 kinda gross. \n\nIf I ever came across a toy belonging to my child, I\u2019d pretend I never saw it and move on. But the issue here is it seems like she\u2019s trying to undermine your Dad\u2019s authority. It\u2019s like \u2026 \u201chey I\u2019m the cool parent you can trust me\u201d or something. \n\nAs for not closing your door? Absolutely not. He\u2019s punishing you for something your Mom did, and taking away privacy is such a messed up thing to do in general, unless it\u2019s for safety reasons (like self harm). If this were me, I would write a letter and send it to them both explaining why you\u2019re upset and why being punished for something you didn\u2019t do is going to make you trust them a lot less. \n\nSet boundaries. Mom, if you want to buy me a gift, please talk to Dad first so I don\u2019t get in trouble for accepting it. And no more intimate items, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with it. Dad, you punished me for something I didn\u2019t do, is that what you want me to learn from this? That I can\u2019t trust you? Or that if I come to you with a sensitive subject like this, that you\u2019ll punish me for it? \n\nBecause this behavior is gonna lead to you going no contact with both of them once you\u2019re 18.",
         "Dad should have definitely taken this up with Mom instead of punishing you. Teens have a right to privacy within reason, and having a door to your bedroom is more than reasonable. You haven\u2019t done anything wrong. To be honest it would be better to speak about this to a therapist if possible. \n\nI would also recommend that you remind your dad that taking your door off its hinges is also behavior that makes you uncomfortable. Same talk with mom for giving you age-inappropriate gifts. Maybe ask them to sit down together with you so you can tell them how YOU feel about this. Especially if therapy isn\u2019t in the cards for whatever reason. But if you can get them to do a family session with you that would be even better since you\u2019d have a therapist to mediate and make sure you got to say your full and honest piece.",
         "Sweetheart, as a fairly unbreakable rule, if a grownup wants to talk to you about sexy stuff, and buy you intimate gifts, and they tell you to keep it secret from the person who looks after you (in your case, your dad), they *are not a safe grownup*. You didn't mess up, and your dad is angry with your mom, not with you. \n\nIt's probable, I think, that she is stupid-inappropriate rather than predatory-inappropriate, but she isn't behaving the way an adult should towards a young person, and your dad is likely making sure she is 100% clear on that before you can see each other again.\n\nI don't personally think he should make you keep your door open, but the reason for that, and for checking your phone, will be to make sure that neither your mom nor any other adult is being inappropriate with you.\n\nYou can't really fix it, because you haven't done anything wrong in the first place. It might help a bit if you can reassure your dad that you understand that an adult asking you to keep secrets around sex is a warning bell, and that you will treat it like one in the future.",
         "Your dad is correct. \n\nYour mother is sexualizing you at a very young age. Her behavior is highly inappropriate. You're lucky to have a dad who looks out for you, it is not healthy for you to be with your mom. Parents are supposed to be parents not act like their teenaged children are their friends. \n\nYou did not get your mom in trouble, she got herself in trouble. She asked you to keep secrets which is extremely inappropriate. Think about it, if what she was doing was healthy and normal, why the need to keep it a secret? \n\nRather than wait for you to develop a natural curiosity, she pushed this topic on you. She is not teaching you healthy sexual development by buying you thongs - she teaching you that you're a thing for men to desire. You're not. You're a human being with a brain and dreams. \n\nThis is the reason your mother does not have any rights over you. She cannot be trusted to make good decisions and consider what is best for you.",
         "Is your father usually like that? Because, although what he did is not great, it seems he was acting out of tension because he knows your mother and he might be scared of something worse. If this is not his usual style, I would suggest trying a conversation once he is less angry/afraid. Your mother is really not the best person you have around, but your father needs to talk to you in a better manner about everything.",
         "Both of your parents are out of line here.  You should find a school counselor or some other adult who isn't related to you to confide in.",
         "OP, this would be different if you mom was approaching the subject of sex from the perspective of trying to educate you, teach you to have boundaries when it comes to bodily autonomy and consent and ways practice safe sex. But it doesn't sound like she's doing that AT ALL. It would be different if you had questions about sex and approached your mom with them to get a female perspective.... But again, it doesn't sound like that.\n\nI know this is going to sound odd. But if the genders were reversed and your mom was your dad, I would say that \"he\" was trying to groom you. It's not so different just because the genders are reversed. OP. **What your mom did was 100% sexually inappropriate**, it almost sounds like she's encouraging you or pushing you into having sexual experiences before YOU are ready.\n\nThis is not ok, OP. Your dad is 100% right to not let your mom see you anymore and if I were you, I would be wary. I probably wouldn't want to see her either.\n\nPlease take this seriously, because an unwanted pregnancy or a sex with the wrong person can really mess up your life and I am beyond disturbed that it is your mom doing this when her priority should be to educate and protect you.",
         "You did nothing wrong. Your mom is pushing you to be someone you\u2019re not yet. That\u2019s not cool. It is entirely inappropriate for her to be buying you these things unprompted, I requested.\u00a0\n\nYour father is freaking out and overreacting.

This is pretty much exactly why courts sometimes don\u2019t give one parent custody. \n\nI know it\u2019s not fun to hear, but your mom is WAY out of line, and what she did is very Not Okay. Your dad sees that and he\u2019s trying to protect you. \n\nI would just do what your dad says for now. Eventually, you may have to remind him that your mom did that and it made you uncomfortable. This is Not Your Fault. I think you dad knows that, but he doesn\u2019t know how else to protect you.",
         "I\u2019m a mom - also the daughter of a mom who acted like this. My dad got custody of me at 8 in the 80s so I get that side of it too. \n\nIt\u2019s super inappropriate and she shouldn\u2019t have gifted you a sex toy. It\u2019s just not \u2018normal\u2019 behavior for a mom IMO. \n\nI am sex positive where it\u2019s age and situation appropriate - no more and no less. I\u2019m not buying my daughter a sex toy or thongs etc. \n\nYou did nothing wrong telling your dad the truth. Your mom kind of messed up here and sometimes there\u2019s consequences and she\u2019s gonna have to pay those it seems.\n\nEdit to add: talk to dad and ask why you are being punished with the door when it\u2019s your mom who screwed up. You put all the junk in the closet and told him the truth when he asked. What did you do wrong here?",

It sounds like he is already trying to talk to your mom about this. \n\n\nIt's really strange that your mom wasn't allowed to have unsupervised contact with you when you were younger -- does she have a history of doing inappropriate things, or maybe of having the type of boyfriends that aren't great for you to be around? I feel like that's an important part of the picture, even if it's something you don't want to talk about with Reddit strangers. \n\n\nIf your dad feels he needs to keep you safe from your mom, maybe he wants to make sure this doesn't escalate to your mom taking you to clubs or introducing you to guys who might take advantage of you. \n\n\nThis is a mess.  Is there anyone who knows your mom and dad that you can talk to?",
         "Good to see these answers here. Child being exposed to sexual behaviour by a parent inappropriately.",
         "Your mom is feeling bad about the living situation and wants to be your cool friend rather than a parent. She put you in a bad situation. You need to talk to your dad and explain that his reaction to an uncomfortable situation is making things worse for you. He needs to discuss this with your mom while supporting you.",
         "Yeah. Your mom seems to be overstepping for a mother of a 14 year old who sees her a few times a month. Sounds like there is more/other concerning things she has probably done to lose your dad\u2019s trust. This feels gross",
         "Fourteen is, in my personal opinion, NOT at all an appropriate age for your mother to be buying you a sex toy. I can completely understand why your Dad lost it over this, I would be disgusted if my daughter's mother pushed sexual exploration onto her like that. It's one thing to talk about sex, you're of an age where a lot of kids do start to experiment and fool around, but it's another to go out and buy provocative underwear and toys that are not meant for children. They're called Adult Toys for a reason. \n\nI will say that it is not your job to fix this - in so much that you cannot. Your Dad has every right to be upset over this and I suspect your Mum knows damned well it wasn't the mature move to make here. I can't speak for her motivations, but it wasn't bought for you from good intentions. No sane parent would buy their fourteen year old a sex toy. \n\nYou haven't messed up. I'm sorry but this is all on your Mum for putting you in a position that you shouldn't be in. \n\nIf you do want to talk to your Dad, don't apologise because you've done nothing wrong. You were given gifts from a parent who is absent and didn't know what to do with them. Of course you didn't, you're a kid! Your Dad isn't angry at you, doesn't blame you. I suspect this will absolutely put a huge strain on whatever relationship he has with your mother, in terms of him letting you see her and I can understand that. \n\nYou did nothing wrong. I've said it before and I'll say it again because you will take this as something you did, but it wasn't you. It isn't a bad idea to take a break from seeing your Mum, which may not be easy to accept but if this is a woman who thought nothing of making such a purchase for her child, she clearly needs to learn that what she's done isn't appropriate.",
         "Your parents are both pretty awful. With your mom, it's a type  of sexual abuse, like emotional incest. I'm sure she and your dad split because she was the \"wild child\" in their marriage and he was the \"strict, disapproving parent.\" So this is her way of thumbing her nose at him, and she's setting off all his alarm bells, thinking that you're going to follow in her footsteps. I'm not crazy about his snooping through your closet -- what was THAT all about? BOTH of them are violating your boundaries, which you have a right to.\n\nI assume your father confiscated the stuff your mom gave you, which is too bad, because you could pack them up and mail them back to her, saying your sexuality is YOURS to explore in your own time. But to get your dad off your back, you could write her a letter to that effect, let him read it and mail it. Tell him he doesn't have to worry about you going wild (if that's the issue with your mother) because you have been raised differently than she was. You might want to avoid visits with your mother, who seems sketchy. I hope your father will back off.",
         "You don't try to fix this. Listen to your dad and let him handle it. Your mom was way out of line.",
         "Mom of a teen here - your dad is blowing this WAY out of proportion. Look at the result - you feel bad and sad because of it and *you* have not done anything; sex and shame is a destructive combination. I'm not saying he shouldn't feel icky about it- parents commonly want to remain ignorant about their kids growing up. I'm aware on a daily basis(!) that my stewardship of my kid where they were the center of my world is slowly coming to an end. I was devastated the first day of pre-k, I'll be devastated the day they move out lol\n\nHe needs to have a CALM conversation with your mother. I hope your mother also impressed upon you that these things will be there for you w*hen you're ready*. Grow at your own pace because adulthood isn't going anywhere. \n\nNot allowed to close your door is ridiculous. All its going to do is make you afraid to trust him. As if he thinks if he doesn't lock you'll up you'll go from a child to a floozy\\* overnight. The best thing he can do is remain dependable and encourage your patience, awareness and self confidence - the kind of thing that allows you to make meaningful choices and avoid getting taken advantage of by others. \n\nIs there another female adult you can speak to? An aunt or someone that can be a neutral party \n\n\\* no disrespect intended to the flagrantly sexually active",
         "You\u2019ve done absolutely nothing wrong. This isn\u2019t you \u2018getting your mom in trouble\u2019. Your parents are the adults. Sounds like mom has a hard time with proper boundaries. It\u2019s never ok for an adult to ask you to keep secrets. Ever. I see where she\u2019s coming from, but mom was woefully underprepared and didn\u2019t hit the mark with trying to have an age appropriate discussion about your body and sexuality. All of your feelings are valid! I would love for you to start seeing a really good therapist or even school counselor regularly to help you navigate all of this. Your parent\u2019s should be trying to find ways to support you and that\u2019s a great start! I\u2019m sorry your dad lost control of his big emotions in front of you, that\u2019s wasn\u2019t ok. Its always ok to discuss your body and sexuality questions with a therapist/counselor. They can be much better equipped than a lot of well meaning parents to handle those tricky discussions. Good luck to you!",
         "Damn, 14? I think talking about it and considering birth control would be appropriate. Toys though? That\u2019s\u2026that\u2019s crossing the line. Your dad has a right to be furious. Mom needs to learn what is age appropriate. But I think that he needs to listen to you and consider the fact that you don\u2019t even invite any of those gifts and he should trust you more. Not having a door is extreme, especially since you really didn\u2019t do anything wrong. \n\nSorry OP what a mess you\u2019re in, at no fault of your own. Suggest family counseling and see if that\u2019s an option.",
         "Even though 14 is an age to maybe get curious etc. and it's good for parents to be open about this stuff and not make it something bad or sinful, I cannot believe your mother bought you a toy and thongs. Nothing wrong with those at all, but you're so young still (no offense meant) and that's is rather adult stuff I think. It's okay to explore things but in your own way and time. And taking the entire background story in consideration, I think your mother was way out of line and I cannot understand why she would introduce things to you this way. I can understand your fathers feelings but he should not really be taking those out on you though.",
         "Step 1. write you all your thoughts on the whole situation, from start to finish. This subject can feel really icky at your age, and you may be inclined to ignore and repress instead of inspect those feelings. If you want to communicate with your parents, you are going to need to first understand what it is that you want to say.\n\n(I'm giving you prompts to ask your self questions, but do not respond to me with the answers. these are just for you to think about.)\n\nFor instance, how did you feel when your mom gave you the gift? Scared? Nervous? What did you think would happen if you accepted them? What did you think would happen if you had refused? Why was accepting them the best choice, between the two?\n\nhow did you feel when your dad confronted you? Afraid he would stop loving you if he thought you were sexually active? Afraid you might not see your mom again?\n\nStep 2. Understand what is your fault and what is not. It's not your fault that your mom gave you a sex toy, so you have nothing to apologize for. So don't explain. Nothing you can do.\n\nYou did make a choice to accept the gift though, and then to keep if from your dad. These are the parts you talk about.\n\nDid you feel trapped without any good answer when you encountered these decisions? If you felt trapped in these conversations with your mom, then THAT PART is the part that needs to be worked out. That part is the root of the problem. And with your dad, if you are afraid of his actions, voice that you are afraid of him, and ask for reassurance that you have nothing to fear.\n\nThis is an example of how a convo with you dad could go (though your actual feelings will have to drive the real conversation.) Write it down and then you can either give it to him, or read it out loud.\n\n\"I have some things to tell you about that are really important. And because they are important, i wrote them down so io would not leave out anything. Please listen to the whole thing first and then we can go back to each.\n\nDad, i appreciate that you are looking out for me. The truth is, you are right; I'm not grown up enough yet for those gifts. I knew that i wasn't, which was why i didn't use them. I hope you can see how i was able to protect my boundaries, and i can be trusted to be responsible. But i also cherish my relationship with mom, and i feel i want to connect over *something.* I didn't want to hurt her feelings, and I should have just told her I wasn't ready yet. Maybe if we had some other things to bond over, i wouldn't have felt like i had to lie to her. I understand why we need a time out from mom, but maybe after, you could help mom learn some of the things you already know i like, and we can try to bond again over those things.\n\nI understand why you feel you have to protect me, but it makes me sad that you do not trust me anymore, and won't let me have my door. I was stuck between two parents i love very much and i feel like anything i would have done would have been the wrong thing. So i also don't know what i can do to regain your trust. I wish i would have told you, but i felt you would blame me or get mad at me, or take my mom away. You feel like you can;t trust me, but the truth is, i don;t think i can trust you either. And i need to hear from you that you will love me no matter what. And that you would have helped mom bond with me better instead of taking her away from me. And that you would have still loved me even if i had been using those things.\"",
         "You didn\u2019t do anything wrong! There would be nothing wrong with being interested in those things, if it occurred to you naturally. It\u2019s not appropriate for an adult to suggest them to you. It seems like your mom might be trying to push you into maturity because she doesn\u2019t know how to bond with you as a kid. She doesn\u2019t understand appropriate boundaries. She might be trying to manufacture a \u201cspecial bond\u201d where you feel like only she \u201cgets it\u201d and think she\u2019s being cool, so that you would want to see her more than your dad currently lets you. This is not okay, because her role in your life should never be about her feelings and what she wants, it should be about what\u2019s best for you. Your dad is trying to maintain boundaries for her because she\u2019s not willing or able to do so. However, he overreacted by taking your door, that\u2019s unfair and you deserve privacy always. I hope he calms down and returns that to you. \n  \nYou don\u2019t have to do anything to fix this. It\u2019s perfectly understandable why you didn\u2019t say anything. It\u2019s such a weird situation and you didn\u2019t want more problems! In the future, if an adult tells you to keep something a secret from other adults, just remember you don\u2019t have to listen and it was weird of them to ask you for that. \n  \nAlso, please do not accept any DMs about this post, no matter who they say they are. It\u2019s weirdos out there.",
         "Absolutely strange for a mother to be suggesting these types of things for her 14 year old daughter. Something is very out of place.",
         "Sound alike your dad's assessment of your mother spot on. She tries to be the cool one without responsibilities.\n\n\nAt 14 you are free to buy stuff like sex toys and underwear if you want it. Giving it to you without being asked is a bad move.\u00a0\nHowever I do not think you did anything wrong. You took it, put it in your drawer and left it there. Talking about everything with everyone is a bit much to ask for.\n\n\nMaybe be open about it with your father that you didn't have any questions and know it is weirdo but you value the time with your mother and did have no intention of using any of it and therefore out it away. Assure him that if you actually have questions you would ask him, you just don't have anything on your mind right now (assuming that this is true).\nTry to navigate a way that he trusts your judgement also, you can frame it that way. You know your mother is not always doing trat things but you want contact and he should trust you to not do stupid things. Maybe assure him to tell him more about what is going on moving forward.\u00a0\n\n\nThis seems a pretty complicated situation, I hope you can resolve it in a way that is acceptable to everyone involved, but mainly for you.",
         "Totally, was your mother out of line for what she bought you but it possibly could be illegal. I\u2019m 99% sure and your mother would say is possibly grooming you.

What was the cause of the divorce nine times out of 10? They do not give custody to the fathe not unless there\u2019s a very good reason, declaring the mother and an in parent.

How do you feel about the adult toy and thongs your mother gave you ?\nIt sounds like your mom is introducing you to sex rather than you leading the conversation, which I believe is backwards. Her job is to listen and support, not to initiate your sexuality. Try to enjoy just being a young adult, curious about the world and how it works.",
         "You did NOT mess up. Not the least little bit. Not anywhere along the way. I'm sorry you have to deal with a seriously toxic mom. You're craving a relationship, and to know your mother loves you, are 100% normal natural things to feel. It's not a thinking thing. It's emotional, easily untethered from logic. And more a thing that happens to people than a thing that people choose to do.\n\nYour mom has been sexually and emotionally abusing you. She shrouded it in \"just us girls\" secrecy, manipulating your desire for an emotionally intimate relationship with your mom and your being completely blindsided and unprepared for her intrusions on your safety, privacy, autonomy and comfort. Whatever her motivation, she has subjected you to unwanted exposure to sexual practices and images with no regard for your readiness, consent, or vulnerability.\n\nIt's normal and okay to learn about how bodies work and how sex works at your own pace and comfort level. Sweetie, no adolescent's comfort level is a parent injecting porn props into a young teen's life under cover of \"sharing our mom-daughter secrets.\" Your feelings are valid and 100% grounded in reality. \n\nYou have the right to discuss or not anything about your life, at your comfort level. It can be very confusing when the person violating normal healthy boundaries is a person we are highly focused on and invested in. \n\nGood job telling your dad. That shame, fear, guilt, doubt and hurt you feel are the results of your mother's abuse. Don't believe you are particularly different or unloved or broken because you feel so, terribly deeply so, right now. A very bad thing has happened to you. You are wounded. Take care of yourself and time to heal.",
         "As other people have pointed out... both of your parents are wrong here. Not sure what your mom is trying to do here with you being 14... but it's kinda fucked up regardless of the intent. It would be different if you'd gone to her about it. And your dad's reaction is borderline gross and his \"temporary measures\" are victim blaming to boot. You didn't ASK your mom for any of that, so why is he putting it on you? And if you HAD? Then he DEFINITELY is out of line. It's understandable for him to be upset about it given what your mom did, but he shouldn't be putting ANYTHING on you.",
         "Honey, 14 is too young for a mother to be going down the path of supplying sex toys. Your dad may not be perfect, but I'd freak the fuck out if I found out that ANY girl your age was provided with a sex toy by a non-custodial parent. Listen, we ALL masturbate, it is absolutely normal, BUT! your mom giving you a dildo introduces a \"grooming\" element here and your dad is right to be concerned. Here's the thing, YOU didn't approach your mom for this kind of intervention, SHE brought it up. And you were clearly not ready for that kind of sex talk. As an older mom, I  would ABSOLUTELY have words with your mom, and I would ABSOLUTELY limit your contact with her. This is grooming behavior, please let your dad protect you. You did NOTHING wrong. Your mom created this entire drama, please take that into account. You should be able to spend time with your mother without feeling responsible for her or defending her, that is not normal or healthy.\n\nEdit: Your dad is wrong to rob you of your privacy and to not let you close your door. He is reflexively over-reacting, and blaming the victim, and that's not cool. He needs to deal with your mom, you are not the problem. Is there a school counselor you can reach out to that could calm your dad down and back you up?",
         "It might not seem this way to you yet, but what your mom did was extremely inappropriate and almost dangerous behavior. This entire conversation would be different if you asked for these items but you did not. For now, I think it best if you let the trustworthy adult in your life - your dad - handle the issue directly with your mom and for you to take a step back. But know that you have done nothing - and I mean absolutely nothing - wrong. \n\nNow as to the issue with your dad, I would talk to him about it. It's not that he doesn't trust you, but I think he got a very real reminder that there are people out there who will exploit your trust and innocence if he's not there to protect you so he's getting overly protective. With that, I would talk to him. Ultimately, you can talk to him about better understanding boundaries. And about knowing when to talk to him, and when things can be kept privately for yourself. But the reality is, he can't be there at all times in everything that you do and you may be in need of tools to better inform your future judgment.\n\nI am sorry your parents put you in this position. But please, please know you really haven't done anything wrong. The fact that you reached a conclusion - that maybe you should have brought it up to your dad sooner - is great. But the instinct that maybe you should have just thrown it away is exactly why you might be in need of a bit more guidance. \n\nGrowing up is hard - and it is immeasurably harder when you don't have a great, solid example to follow. But you're doing it so don't fret. This too will blow over. And if there are changes that happen to your relationship with your mom, it's because of your mom and not because of anything you did.",
         "When you are an adult, and you have a daughter/child, I have a feeling you are going to truly understand why your dad reacted the way he did, and understand how he is reasonable. \n\nYour mom, while likely well-intentioned, has overstepped a boundary with you that is really not okay. If you had asked your mom for these items because he were ready to explore and felt comfortable talking to her about it, that's one thing. What you've described could literally be considered a crime, OP. And that's for a reason. \n\nI want to reiterate, I know you love your mom and you know that she meant well. Sometimes well-intentioned people are hurt/messed up a little, and they can in turn hurt/overstep boundaries of others. Your dad is doing the right thing by protecting you, figuring out the situation, and it sounds like the no contact is not a forever thing.",
         "Ohhhhhh, honey, your father is correct. You being 14 is just icky and suggests she thinks if you get pregnant she will have control over your life. I'd ask her to back off and I wouldn't ask nicely either. Establish a boundary she doesn't realize should be there.",
         "Seems like your mom is immature and inappropriate. Your dad shouldn\u2019t be reacting the way he is but it\u2019s common for dads to be funny about these things. Please remember that there is nothing to be ashamed about exploring your sexuality as you grow up. You shouldn\u2019t feel pressured to share things with your parents and they shouldn\u2019t ask any more than to know you are safe. Your mom and dad fighting is not about you - it\u2019s about them. Just like if you had a partner it would be on you to nourish your relationship or your friendships. I am sorry you are in such an awkward position.",

Dad doesn't seem off the mark here as he found everything as you said, and they together do not paint a good picture of what your mother is doing. Taking the door is definitely extreme, but its hard to blame that reaction given what he found for someone that underage.\n\nMaybe its best if you do spend time away from your mother for a while.",
         "It takes a lot for a parent that wants some custody time to lose all custody. There is definitely a lot more to the story and likely your father is trying to protect you from it. He may be taking the protection bit a bit too far by taking away your privacy, but I\u2019m inclined to give him the benefit of the doubt since he\u2019s the one that has consistently shown up for you. It may be that he realized letting you see your mom unsupervised was a mistake on his part and now he\u2019s over correcting.\n\nYour mom however is extremely inappropriate. I\u2019m sorry to say, but any teenage girl that sees their mom as the cool mom has a mom that isn\u2019t really parenting. Part of being a good parent means you\u2019re inevitably going to be seen as uncool for the boundaries you set for your teenager. No matter how old you are, having your mother insist you should wear thongs is not ok, but especially at your age. You\u2019re allowed to take your time growing up. It definitely is a good idea to take a break from that relationship and maybe speak to a therapist about how to navigate it because the way your mom is approaching it is unhealthy. And also as the non-custodial parent, she should never be telling you to hide things from the custodial parent. That\u2019s a major red flag.",

         "First of all, this is not your fault. Second of all, you are just a kid. Barely even a teenager. Your dad is 100% correct that your mom is out of line. If you want to explore on your own, that's totally fine and normal. It's definitely old enough for your dad (since he is the custodial parent) to have the sex talk with you. However, it is not old enough for an adult to be buying you a sex toy and revealing underwear that you're not comfortable wearing. That is grooming. You're still young enough to shop in the kids section. Your dad is trying to protect you from another adult forcing you to be sexual when you're not ready. Unfortunately, that adult is your mom. I do think he should be letting you close your door because you deserve privacy, but he's probably afraid your mom might try to contact you behind his back. Please don't try to contact your mom until your dad says it's safe. I know it really sucks not being able to talk to her or see her but she's clearly not a safe adult for you to be around. I'm so sorry that you're going through this and I hope things get better for you soon.",

Take accountability in the discussion (e.g. I know that mum said not to tell you, and I know that I should have, and I'm sorry for not telling you), and it might help your dad realise that he is over focused on trust with you when you're as much of a victim of your mum's actions.",

Okay I don't know what the laws are where you live and if you can decide to see her even if he says know. I wonder though why she lost custody, if it was something serious then I suppose your father should be able to say know. But generally I think a teen should decide themselves if they want some contact and your father sounds bit too controlling but I can understand his concern too depending on why she lost custody.\n\nI don't think you should keep things like this as a secret from your father though even if you may not want to lose contact with your mother.",
         "Personally, I think this is highly disturbing behavior on your mom\u2019s part and I\u2019m sure there is an ulterior motive. \n\nYour dad is 100% in the right and is doing what\u2019s best to protect you. I think the open door and checking phone is just a temporary thing as he\u2019s probably still wrapping his head around the situation.\n\nYour dad likely has full custody for a reason and has more insight into your mom than you do. The relationship with your dad will likely repair itself, just give it up. And keep an open line of communication with him.",
         "I mean between 14-16 you probably should start figuring out what you like, before you\u2019re doing anything with boys.\u00a0\n\n\nYou can\u2019t tell or show someone else what you like if you don\u2019t know - but no one tells a lot of girls that and they get railroaded when they start dating and being told what they should like.\u00a0\n\n\nHowever I\u2019d think a couple books and a gentle vibrator are the most a mom should provide. Lingerie is a bit much. Dad needs to deal though. You need to know and own your sexuality and desires, not have them be owned by your father, boyfriend, or husband.\u00a0\n\n\nYour mom might be concerned if she knows your dad is like this.\u00a0\n\n\nAlso open door? He has to sleep sometime so if you were determined, the door wouldn\u2019t make a different.\u00a0",
         "Sounds like you are being groomed by your mother.",
         "your mom and dad are both being weird about these things. your mom's gifts are not appropriate for your age or relationship with her, and your dad drastically curtailing your privacy because of those gifts is not fair to you. you haven't done anything wrong. you should reach out to another trusted adult like a therapist to help you navigate this situation in person, but in the meantime you did well by reaching out to the adults here for advice. the most important thing to understand is that you haven't messed anything up or done anything wrong, you only tried your best to do the right and respectful thing with unwanted gifts.",
         "Seriously, I think your mom is pushing boundaries and being overly sexual.\u00a0\n\n\nShe could tell you about periods and answer questions as you develop and have them. However, pushing lingerie and sex on a teen is not something that should be done.\n\n\nIt almost feels like she is prepping you to work. I think your dad is right here.\n\n\nYou have not done anything wrong. He is protecting you. I don't know how safe your mom is to be around.\u00a0\n\n\nGrow up at your own rhythm.",
         "I\u2019m a dad and if I had that same situation, I probably would\u2019ve handled it just as inappropriately. I think he (I would) will calm down in short time. You did nothing a normal teen wouldn\u2019t have done, you aren\u2019t the problem. \n\nYour parents obviously have issues and some of the anger directed at you should really be directed at your mother. Her wanting to discuss sex, boys, etc should be age appropriate and shouldn\u2019t include toys and revealing clothing unless YOU requested them.",
         "The moment your mom told you not to tell your dad, he became justified in his reaction. If an adult tells you to keep secrets from one of your parents, especially in regards to sex and your body, that is a red flag.  There are a few exceptions to this rule (all having to do with how safe the other parent is). But nothing about your post points to dad being abusive or against your autonomy.\n\nThis is weird activity from your mom. It is one thing to be open and engaged with your teenager. Another to be forcing them to explore in such specific ways",
         "The real problem here is your dad nog respecting your privacy!",
         "Your mom\u2019s obsession with hypersexualizing you is not good. Yes, at 14 you will be exploring. On your own, in your own way. Totally normal. Her buying you sexy lingerie unasked for is not healthy. Her buying you sex toys your body can\u2019t use yet, not healthy. She sounds juvenile\u2026wanting you to hang/party with her friends and gossip about boys with you. She\u2019s going to be ecstatic if you have a teen pregnancy. \n\nA secret can be kept from a parent if it has a shelf life (don\u2019t tell dad about the surprise birthday present) it should never be kept if there\u2019s no end date. I\u2019m divorced and I would never encourage my kids to keep something from their dad.",
         "There should be no secrets kept from your dad.",
         "Your mother is an AH; your father too.",
         "I\u2019m sorry. But your dad is right. It would be different if you had asked your mother for those things, but. That\u2019s just not okay behavior on your mother\u2019s part.",
         "It's not your job to fix this, but I would suggest that you tell your dad that your mom's is also your parent and she also has the right to parent you.  He doesn't have to like what your mom is doing and he also doesn't have to like what you are doing.  He needs to chill out, seriously.",
         "Yep\u2014my mom started doing this to alienate my dad at close to this age. But she bought me cigarettes at 15 and talked about smoking weed in high school and how normal it was.\n\nGood call out. Took me a few years into adulthood to really unravel the issues with it.",
         "Sorry, I'm 14. I'll put that on the post too.",
         "Yeah, I agree. It\u2019s difficult to say exactly what mom\u2019s motivation is here but it\u2019s odd at best. I get wanting your kids to be open with you, hoping they will keep you posted on important developments including sex related things. I can also see a particularly open mother and daughter shopping for adult toys together or buying them for each other, when both parties are adults. \n\nOP, this is not meant to be disrespectful to you, but you\u2019re too young for that imo. Your dad is likely really upset and confused. It\u2019s not right (again imo) for you to be in any trouble over this, but I understand his feelings. He\u2019s concerned and confused and wants to know what your mom was thinking to make it ok in her mind before he lets you be alone with her again. Because you\u2019re a minor and giving you a sex toy that you can\u2019t legally buy yourself is odd behavior. He wants to know she\u2019s making good decisions for you. But he should sit down with you and explain what he\u2019s thinking himself, because I\u2019m willing to bet almost all of his frustration is with your mom. \n\nTLDR: Adults are just old kids, they\u2019re definitely not perfect, not even your parents. Mom\u2019s behavior is worth questioning. Dad is justified in being upset but he shouldn\u2019t take it out on you",
         "I'm so sorry OP You are caught in the crossfire between trenches, your parents need to end that proxy war. It's not your fault, you did the best you could",
         "And why would dad be snooping around his young daughter's closet to find hidden pieces of underwear? Barring my husband, I would be extremely uncomfortable if even my mom or dad opens my closet to look at my underwear, and they would also feel the same way.",
         "In the future, please do not approach these situations by asking the OP to admit their age. You know the creeps who lurk on this sub. The kid could get preyed on.\n\nYes, the age changes things and it is relevant, but if you had removed the line \"Your current age needs to be part of this.\u00a0\" you still would have been able to impart the exact same advice (\"If this age, then X, but if that age, then Y\") without OP potentially getting DM harassment.",
         "It\u2019s better than her going out and experimenting with guys. Kids are sexual from birth in their own exploratory ways. It\u2019s better to be open and honest about development, and her dad is stuck in denial about her maturing. He needs to respect privacy and boundaries-I see why your mom divorced him. Too authoritarian.",
         "OP, I suspect there's a reason your dad has full custody that you don't know about. Her actions here are inappropriate (though you do still deserve a door). You might go to your dad and tell him anything he doesn't already know about wrt your mom's contact with you, and then ask if there's anything you don't know about her that you should.",
         "I'm 14. Sorry I added that on my post now. Thank you for the comment.",
         "In the future, please do not approach these situations by asking the OP to admit their age. You know the creeps who lurk on this sub. The kid could get preyed on.\n\nYes, the age changes things and it is relevant. You should instead just be upfront with your assessment in the first place. For instance:\n\n\"If you were between X-Y years old, i would say... but if Y-Z, then i believe...\" This allows you to impart your conditional advice while also protecting OP.",
         "This is exactly what I thought as well. Mom is grooming her.",
         "My mind went here as well. Very suspicious behavior on the part of the mom.\n\n  \nDad is not helping by taking the door away. How is she supposed to change? That is also a very weird reaction.",
         "Op, this is good advice. I'd like to reiterate that it is normal to start being curious about sex at your age but also totally normal to not have any interest in it yet. Don't let anyone pressure you into doing things you are not ready for. \n\nAnd you did nothing wrong. Your parents sound like they have some opposing opinions on this topic.",
         "Good point. My kids\u2019 conservative dad asked me to make sure to talk to the girls about masturbation. I brought it up and said if they wanted to get a vibrator, I\u2019d order it for them. I\u2019m sure they\u2019d be too embarrassed to ask me to do that, though. I most definitely wouldn\u2019t buy them thong underwear, unless we were shopping for clothes and they asked.",
         "This is the key! A good therapist or counselor you can see regularly! Very helpful",
         "Excellent advice. Both parents are doing a bad job, I really hope OP has an adult she is safe to turn to for help. It really, really sucks to feel unsafe in your own home, especially at such a vulnerable age (guess how I know). I just want to give her a hug \u2639\ufe0f",
         "As parents, we definitely have a responsibility to violate our children's privacy some of the time. Would you still be against him looking through her things if these gifts had been from Kyle, the third time high-school senior she visits after school?  \n\nTaking off the door isn't a good response though.",
         "I\u2019m guessing it wasn\u2019t redirected anger but just anger that she thinks was directed at her. Because kids do that a lot. \n\nHell, adults do it too. I don\u2019t like people angry around me and I often think it\u2019s directed at me even when it\u2019s just the person venting or being angry in general.\n\nI agree with your advice!",
         "Thank you very much...!",
         "WHAT? why would a mother do this",
         "As another teacher and mandatory reporter I was previously planning to write this exact same thing. We both would be required to report your mothers actions to both police and cps immediately by law. That is how bad it was, and the \"this is our secret\" comment is dangerous red flag. It is used as a tool of grooming, and I have taught all of my students that no adult should ever demand them to keep secrets from their parents. Never.\n\nCombined with the full custody with no visitation, and your dads almost hysterical reaction, are insanely worrying. As a professional I would advise you to talk with safe adult (not mom!!!!), school would be helpful. Do not feel guilty about this. And knowing how your dad already has full custody, you don't have to worry about concrete consequenses. But I hope a professional can tell you the truth in person, that you did nothing wrong and this situation is not your fault.\n\nAnd outside of my job, unofficial advice: I almost got chills when you described your mother, and not the good kind. This is just my gut, but I think you should seriously limit contact with your mother, and talk with your dad. Ask your dad what he is scared of, and try to create more accurate picture of your mother without idealization or desperate yearn for connection. I hope your dad stops the nonsense with doors, he probably is desperately trying to control you to the point where it becomes toxic instead of protective.\n\nPs. Beware of the potential creeps if they contact you. Some people can be gross weirdos",
         "This is very well put.",
         "Yeah that's weird as hell",
         "Thank you.. I could talk to my dad about it again to learn more about his reasoning, but I think it was like making sure I don't call mom or get calls from her and also making sure I don't do anything bad or something like that..? He did say it was temporary though and said he will stop checking my phone and all eventually.\n\nEdit: I'm sorry for the edit, but I think it was also because I tried to hide those from him.",
         "Thank you! I am also the mom of a teen daughter (and I bought thongs for her at Aerie this weekend). I started talking to my kid when she was about the same age that masturbation is normal and healthy; it's not just for boys.  I also told her that she shouldn't have sex she doesn't want or doesn't feel good, and that she never owes anyone sex, for any reason. We talked about choices I made at her age that I am happy with now, and those that I wasn't happy with. If she wanted a toy, I would have considered it. \n\nI didn't think this was out there.",
         "Dads aren't \"funny\" about their daughter's' sexuality, they're misogynist.",
         "No, my dad has full custody, and he was just letting my mom see me time to time.",
         "I feel similar. Depends on what the toy is a bit in my mind too, which is maybe a me issue. The sexy undies is way weirder, why would you encourage a 14 yo to have sex? Masturbating, while weird to discuss with a parent, is less weird than buying your child lingerie.",
         "If she was getting her decent thongs so her daughter wouldn\u2019t have to have her underwear giving her a constant wedgie that  has to be fussed with, I could see that. I spent so much time trying to keep my underwear out of my butt crack. Thongs were an awesome discovery. It the underwear was overly sexy and inappropriate that might not be cool. A sex toy isn\u2019t something you should probably buy your 14 year old. Kids can buy things themselves. It seems like the mom is either trying too hard or trying to sexualize her before she is ready. Keeping it a secret is a little off.",
         "Uhhhh that\u2019s totally not true. Is she supposed to announce when she starts masturbating on a regular basis ? When she decides to buy her own sex toy?\u00a0",
         "The mom here doesn't have any custody rights. He has the right to make this call.",
         "Apparently she doesn't have the right, though. She doesn't have custody, and that's likely for a good reason. Dad needs to take it down, not just one notch, but like, five notches. Something about the mom's behavior is really, really creepy. Like, this is what grooming actually looks like.",
         "I was definitely exploring myself at 14, but it\u2019s weird for your mom to be pushing this on you, especially as you mention you weren\u2019t totally comfortable but went with it because (at least this is my interpretation) you wanted to feel close to mom and have that bonding moment. And for her to tell you specifically not to tell your dad is ringing alarm bells for me. Dad is your custodial parent, you shouldn\u2019t be pressured into keeping secrets from him. \n\nDad\u2019s reaction is also not great \u2014 some parts of it, like him needing to talk to your mom about this before you have more unrestricted access, make sense to me as an adult. He\u2019s not wrong to be wary of someone who is trying to push you into sexual stuff, even masturbation, that you\u2019re not comfortable with. Some parts of his reaction are bad, like yelling at you, shaming you, and taking away door privileges. I know he\u2019s probably freaking out about his darling daughter growing up as well, but that doesn\u2019t make his reaction okay. I want to be very clear here - you did absolutely nothing wrong, and are being put in a shit position by your parents. I\u2019m very sorry for that. If I were in your position, I would sincerely apologize for keeping the secret and for scaring him, but not for anything else.",
         "Yeah, I can't say I blame Dad for wigging out then.\n\nI do think it's unfair that you're essentially being punished by losing privacy when you didn't do anything wrong at all and tbh were the one made to feel uncomfortable.",
         "Your mom is trying to include you in an adult world that isn\u2019t yet appropriate, especially since you didn\u2019t bring it up or ask for the toy. That\u2019s not remotely appropriate.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with adult toys and there\u2019s nothing wrong with sex or thongs or dressing in a way that\u2019s revealing, if that\u2019s what makes you happy. There is something very wrong with pushing those things on a young person before they are ready.\n\nYour mom is in the wrong, your dad is protecting you.",
         "This is throwing major red flags for me because it seems like your mom has a creepy obsession with pushing you into sexual activity. Having \"a talk\" about boys is one thing, but buying you revealing underwear and sex toys is way over the line. So is telling you to keep secrets.",
         "Unless you had been asking your mother questions, she is out of line. Your father isn't handling it well either.\u00a0",
         "14! Bless, kiddo. This was truly, truly not okay.",
         "Yea as a father of an 11 year old, I'd go off too, (on the mom) if her mom did this.  I feel like this is something you talk about with girlfriends, maybe mom and counselor but to buy toys and thongs, that's way overboard.  Especially since she iniated the whole thing as well. \n\nAs far as punishment.. I don't think you did anything wrong so I don't get that part, but yea Good luck",
         "Then your mom is completely out of line. We can\u2019t really say what her motives are, but she is absolutely wrong regardless.",
         "Waaay inappropriate! I\u2019m with dad",
         "Wow. Ok. You\u2019re dad is right. Your mom was out of line. You and your dad need to sit down and have an honest discussion about sex. He needs to be part of the conversation if he\u2019s able to do it. My dad would never have been able to get the words out.",
         "Your dad is right and your mom is being very weird.",
         "Your mother is EXTREMELY out of line. I'm so sorry, this is sexual abuse and your dad is absolutely right to be putting a stop to it.\u00a0",
         "Sorry, but 14 is a bit young for \"dont-tell-your-dad\" conversations. At best, this is her way of isolating that part of your life to only her, which puts her moreso in a position of power than she had before with you. At worst, this is grooming behavior.\n\nYou have so much time to explore and learn about yourself! There's no rush. Don't feel obligated to adhere to the rules your Mom AND Dad are putting on your in regards to your own self-pleasure. It will never be any of their business unless you decide you need to consult them.",
         "The undies are over the line. The toy could have been better included after having the talk. Your mom is crossing the line with you.",
         "So. Here\u2019s my question. I know a LOT of parents who would stock up on tissues and hand lotion and start enforcing a certain amount of laundry to be the boy\u2019s responsibility. To me this is a tacit understanding of what puberty is and does to tweens. I don\u2019t know if this is the girl equivalent or not but let\u2019s not pretend that 14 years olds aren\u2019t exploring their bodies.",
         "Something odd is going on with this thread. Parts of my post are missing and you're commiserating with me as though I'm the OP. If it was a misplaced comment, I'm letting you know OP might not get the message.\u00a0",
         "Oh it's an all around mess OP is growing up in for sure if it's not made up.\n\n\nBut I grew up in a shit situation too and my mom would use any excuse to snoop through my stuff and take issue with even my own private journaling so who knows......some parents are super protective and controlling; some parents buy you dildos and lingerie \ud83e\udd37.",
         "Oh eff off it didn't require that of OP, just that her age matters quite a bit in whether or not mom's gifts are appropriate or predatory. It's the entire reason why I followed it with age windows as you're suggesting.\u00a0",
         "She said she\u2019s not interested in any of it and her mom forced it on her. \u201cSexual from birth\u201d is a weird and wild thing to say. There\u2019s nothing sexual going through a toddlers mind when they touch a part of their body. \n\nIdk how you read this and got \u201ca girl is becoming a woman and her prude of a dad can\u2019t handle it so her creepy estranged mom forcing dildos on her is the hero\u201d. This is a deadbeat mother who left her kid returning to give her a (at best) vibrator and some thongs. Shes asking her to dish about boys and her thoughts on sex like a drunk 30 something at a bachelorette party. \n\nLeading with \u201cBetter than being with a guy (aka dating a peer)\u201d is peak brain worms.",
         "Yes. If there is something really terrible about mom, this is the right time for OP to find out.",
         "This is a bit too far for assumptions. It's more likely mom and dad were both real young when they had kids and they're equally bad, dad is just less bad as far as the court could tell.\n\nThat doesn't make this sort of assumption it true even if mom's behavior is out of whack. We also know dad's reaction was to take OP's door clean off the hinges so both parents sound a bit ...unhinged.",
         "Nah, your mom was wrong for giving you the highly inappropriate gifts at your age. It's weird AF that's she's giving you revealing underwear ,thongs, and the sex toy.",
         "Given the nature of this post, please do not entertain any \"woman\" who might DM you asking you for more info about your post (if you tried the items your mother bought, or their suggestions that she did this to mean well (even if she did.)) This is all just a premise to coerce you to talk about sex with them. Do not answer any private questions, just block and move on. No one who is going to give you genuine guidance is going to do it privately.",
         "How old was mom when she had you? Are you abnormally close in age? This is \"cool mom\" behavior and it's not great.\n\nHowever, that doesn't make dad's response appropriate or good. Often, when people have children too young you get these sorts of out of whack reactions. I'm really sorry you have to go through this.",
         "Yeah it\u2019s super creepy",
         "Hey girly, if an adult (ANY ADULT) asks you to keep a secret, *they are not a safe person to be around.* Next time tell a trusted adult and let them deal with it. This was inappropriate, your mom knew it, and knew she shouldn\u2019t be doing it.\n\nTo be clear: you did nothing wrong.",
         "This might be difficult to hear, but what your mom did was really inappropriate and not in your best interest. You said that your mom doesn\u2019t have custody, so your dad is well within his rights to prevent you from seeing her, especially if he worries about your safety or wellbeing when you are with her. It sounds like that might be what\u2019s happening. If you feel like your dad doesn\u2019t have your best interests at heart, you need to talk to a teacher or coach or school counselor that you trust so they can help you sort through what\u2019s going on. You shouldn\u2019t have to deal with this alone! \n\nKeeping your mom\u2019s actions a secret was both a very normal reaction but also one that can lead to you getting hurt. Some adults will try to use your feelings of embarrassment or shame or your fear of getting in trouble to convince you to keep secrets from other adults in your life - that\u2019s what your mom did. It\u2019s a very effective form of manipulation as you\u2019ve experienced! You did nothing wrong, you were manipulated by an adult you trust and that\u2019s a scary thing to realize. \n\nI really can\u2019t emphasize enough how much of a red flag it is for an adult to tell a teenager to keep an uncomfortable secret. It\u2019s usually a sign that the adult knows they\u2019re doing something very wrong. So no matter how embarrassed or ashamed you feel, you really, really need to talk to a different adult that you trust about what happened! If you feel like you can\u2019t talk about it, write a note or send a text. If you really feel like you\u2019re out of options, posting on this subreddit is a good idea - plenty of women here will gladly help you sort through what\u2019s normal and safe vs abnormal and unsafe. \n\nNow for the discussion your mom should have had with you: it\u2019s normal for young teenagers to have questions about puberty, sex, and sexuality. It\u2019s also normal to not really be interested in those things yet. It\u2019s the sort of thing best taken at your own pace, and that\u2019s why what your mom did was so wrong. Adults that pressure or coerce teenagers into learning about sex, talking about it, or acting on their curiosities are not safe people to be around. I\u2019m not saying your mom is a bad person, just that for right now, it doesn\u2019t seem like she\u2019s acting in a safe way. \n\nPlease be very careful with who you talk to online about this stuff. Some people are real creeps. Open discussions on this subreddit should be safe - the mods will handle anyone being weird. Block and report anyone who DMs you trying to engage in discussions that make you uncomfortable. \n\nRemember how I said you should learn about this stuff at your own pace? [Planned Parenthood](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/teens) has some really great online learning resources that can answer many questions you might have, and you can choose what to read - no pressure, no judgement.\n\nFinally, if/when you do have discussions with any adults in your life about sensitive topics, pay close attention to your own feelings! If you feel like an adult is being pushy or asking you inappropriate questions or saying things that make you feel weird or touching you a little too much or in odd ways or making you feel guilty or conflicted (in regards to sex/puberty/sexuality) or maybe even just acting a little *too* interested in having these types of talks with you\u2026 get away from that person ASAP and tell several adults you trust!!!",
         "Agreed. She or mods should delete her answers\u00a0",
         "There is a big difference between your example and what OP has shared. We don\u2019t know what prompted the search. A search for cause has reasoning. A search of OPs intimate belongings without any prompt is the problem here.\n\nWhat OPs dad *should have done* is when he found these items, had a serious, but calm conversation about it and not punished her. He should have created a safe space for his kid to talk about these adult things. OP felt uncomfortable and/or unsafe telling their dad about these items. His reaction of being upset *at OP* is what was uncalled for. He missed a big opportunity of creating a level of trust with his kid.\n\nSo yes the search is a huge violation of privacy. Similar thing happened to me except it was a journal. I felt violated and when you feel like that **because of a parent**, it doesnt go away. You feel like you cant trust them. Kids dont handle boundary violations like adults do. They are powerless and that can do a lot of damage.",

         "All your actions and reactions have been perfectly understandable, you have done nothing remotely wrong.\n\nBeing interested in that sort of stuff at your age is fine, and exploring your sexuality a bit is fine, but only if it comes from you, no one else should be initiating it or forcing it.\n\nYour mum has acted very inappropriately. And your dad's response seems very focused on you rather than who actually is at fault - your mum. I am hoping your dad will calm down shortly and realised you have done nothing bad and actually taking your door away is also highly inappropriate and so is making you feel bad or wrong around this sort of subject matter.\n\nI am hoping that talking to him might help, if it doesn't you might have to start thinking about talking to someone at school because if your dad doesn't calm down then you have two parents failing you.\n\nYou are clearly a smart kid and I really wish you all the best navigating this.\n\nDo try to remember that being made to feel bad about anything around this subject is not how you should feel.

Between 14-18, I\u2019d expect teenagers to have more and more minor secrets, with major areas of concern being more open.

      "title": "I'm tired of trans women being criticized for very normal and expected behaviors",
      "text": "This post was inspired by a recent post I saw about someone's friend coming out as trans and becoming a very different person.\n\nLots and lots of people say that it's so obvious that us trans women have a shallow view of femininity because we go all in on doing our hair or wearing dresses and painting our nails or whatever. (Let's ignore for now that if a cis woman spent an hour or two in the morning doing her hair and makeup, then showed up to work in a dress literally nobody would ever comment on it)\n\nOf *course* we're going to experiment with that stuff. Of *course* it's going to seem like we see femininity as an aesthetic, *you* did the same thing when you were kids and just started being introduced to femininity and gender roles.\n\nThe only difference is that we started being introduced to those things later in life. People made a comment about how \"it just feels like they're trying to make up for lost time\" yes, that's literally what we're trying to do. We're trying to learn the expectations of womanhood from scratch at a much older age, and without people in our lives teaching us. Of course it feels superficial, because it *is*, we're at the same place as a dang 6 year old when it comes to performing gender.\n\nBack onto what I said about cis women not being criticized about those things.\n\nCould you imagine someone being \"she just has such a superficial view of femininity, we don't wear dresses or makeup like that\" about a cis woman who takes some time in the morning to look nice and wear a dress? Of course not, because that's an *insane* thing to say. Yet it's suddenly perfectly fine to criticize a trans woman for the exact same thing.\n\nOnto my personal experiences. I've had women get mad at me for complaint that my hormone treatment makes me cry a lot. Saying that it's sexist or whatever.\n\nThat's what hormones *do*. (Obviously it has very different effects for everyone and not everyone is going to be a crier, but it very much heavily affects your emotions and how you show them) I'm *literally* going through a man made puberty. It's *normal* for a teen girl to cry a lot during puberty. Could you imagine a teen girl saying \"I fucking hate periods, they make me cry so much\" only to get the response \"that's really sexist, you're acting like women are just super emotional all the time\". *No* *of course not* because that's a super insane thing to say.\n\nOn top of this all, I don't believe this stuff is as pervasive as cis people want to say it is. We naturally notice things that deviate from the norm more than anything else. So your trans friend and you are talking, and she mentions that she's *super* excited to finally try painting her nails, she just got some and it's the cutest color (which she has understood to be a reasonable thing to say because she heard you compliment another woman's nails). But because this has never been said before by her ever, you automatically notice it and remember it. In fact it's the only thing you remember about your little water cooler conversation.\n\nThose build up over the course of a few weeks, then you start complaining about the \"fact\" that she only ever talks about superficial things. When in reality she *always* did (it's kinda funny that the comment she made about finding a super nice perfume sounds very similar to a comment she made a few months back about trying Old Spice out, though, you don't even remember that comment, that sounded normal at the time, the perfume comment didn't) talk about these things. You're just noticing the comments now.\n\nYes, there *are* many issues that *many* trans women perpetuate, but it's *not* because they're trans, its because of how our media represents femininity *and* how we naturally hear more about the abnormal than the normal (why would anyone go in detail about a *normal* experience online when the abnormal is so much more interesting) \n\n(That paragraph mostly was talking about how open women tend to be with each other, regarding things like nudity or sex or whatever. At least *my* friends, we aren't at *all* open with that stuff, so I learned pretty quick. But that *is* a common trope, thus it makes sense it kinda embeds itself in our heads. *Plus* a lot of trans women probably feel closer to their female friends than they ever did their male friends. They have no reference frame for what \"close\" means anymore, so they have no clue when it's appropriate to become more open about that. That's not on them, that's on the fact that they very likely never actually had close male friends (how could you when you don't share any even remotely similar internal experiences?) and while they should be quickly and firmly corrected, it should *also* be understood)",

         "I'm not disagreeing with you but I do want to point out that cis women who spend a lot of time getting ready are absolutely criticized.  See the fun thing about being a woman, regardless of if you're cis or trans , is you will be constantly criticized for every goddamn thing and a lot of it comes from other women.\n\nIf you were a cis woman these woman would probably find another way to shit on you in a way they never would a man.  Part of being a woman is just constantly having shit heaped on you for simply living your life.",
         ">Could you imagine someone being \"she just has such a superficial view of femininity, we don't wear dresses or makeup like that\" about a cis woman who takes some time in the morning to look nice and wear a dress?\n\nUnfortunately, I can. I've even seen it done in supposedly feminist safe spaces. \n\nNo matter how we \"woman\", no matter whether we are more feminine or less feminine, regardless of whether we were AFAB or AMAB, our femininity will always be critiqued -- even by other women. \n\nIt's terrible and I try to remind myself to feel empathy for the kind of person who polices others -- because they're always miserable people -- but it always hurts. It's never our fault, though. Why? Because being a woman is so complex and multi-faceted that despite the \"no matter how you 'woman' it's wrong\" nonsense, the truth is *no matter how you present your gender, it's* ***right***!\n\n>Onto my personal experiences. I've had women get mad at me for complaint that my hormone treatment makes me cry a lot. Saying that it's sexist or whatever.\n\nThat's terrible and I, an AFAB woman, have had the same damn issue with hormonal medication. Unfortunately, I was treated as *unstable* when I was just struggling to cope with the changes to my chemistry.\n\nTL;DR: Quite unfortunately, I've experienced a lot of gender policing like what you've written here as an AFAB woman, *from other women.* It is insane, wrong, hurtful, but it still has happened.\n\nI think you're right about the origins being more or less weird ass assumptions about what a woman is or should be. I even think you're right that my trans sisters experience it more often. I just needed to mention that it seems to be something that all women experience, at the hands of the people who should have our backs.",
         ">Could you imagine someone being \"she just has such a superficial view of femininity, we don't wear dresses or makeup like that\" about a cis woman who takes some time in the morning to look nice and wear a dress? Of course not, because that's an insane thing to say.\n\nSadly not. You'll get used to the fact that you just can't win as a woman. Teenage girls get shit on a lot by everyone around them for trying out makeup (and sometimes going wrong) and also for not trying out makeup. Grown women don't have it much different, it's just less often about bad makeup but more about either \"you should look more natural\" or \"you look so tired and sick\", depending on whether or not you use makeup. \n\nIt's obviously sad that you've had bad experiences with women and sadly there are a lot of transphobic women out there. But let's not forget that women in general are not the enemy here. All that shit comes from and benefits the patriarchy so instead of turning a so against each other let's stay focused on who the real culprit is here - the beauty industry first and foremost",
         "Girl, I see you and validate your experience of being able to woman the way you want to woman, and it sucks to be invalidated by people around you, but AFAB people get critiqued and criticized about the exact things you mentioned *all the time*, nearly verbatim.\n\nI don\u2019t mean to be cynical with you, I actually mean this to affirm you lol, but welcome to womanhood. There is no wrong way to do it, but you will be critiqued no matter what you do. Over the littlest things. And yes, it is outrageous, I\u2019m not excusing it. You have to try to let it roll off you like water off a ducks back. It\u2019s not going to ever stop, and that\u2019s not to excuse it, but just to let you know so you can protect yourself and build up more of that thick skin. \n\nSomething I have noticed and pointed out, sometimes at risk to my friend not talking to me for a while, is that AMAB and AFAB people are socialized VERY differently and treated very differently by society at large. The way that trans-women suddenly get treated and critiqued when presenting as a woman, and the way people just *say things to us* women, things that no one should have the audacity to say, has just really historically blown my trans-women friend\u2019s minds, because when they were presenting to the world as men, *no one would ever think they have the right to speak to them that way.* but we really do get treated and spoken to that way all the time! Again, I\u2019m not trying to invalidate you, but just let you in on the fact that, no, actually this is a very common, basically ubiquitous experience. It is getting better, generally, but girl no, get ready to hear all kinds of wild shit. It doesn\u2019t stop lol.",
         "Getting criticized for dressing too nice or not dressing nice enough.. welcome to femininity.   Everything you do from here on forward is wrong and most men will talk over you and correct you.  Many women will think you are in competition with them. \n\nSorry it isn\u2019t a trans thing. We are just old and mostly ignore/have normalized the critics.  It is why it isn\u2019t really a topic of discussion.  It would be like discussing cramps being painful.  There just isn\u2019t a good solution or one heading this way.",
         "I remember the post.\nOP from that post said they were never feminine, and that 's the reason she wasn't confortable.\nAlso, she didn't want to play sleepovers at that age. ( 30's)",
         "One trans woman early into transition described it thusly (I am paraphrasing): The trappings and signifiers of femininity are not what makes me a woman, but it's what I have right now to signal to the world that I am a woman. As we get further into our transition, if we go down the medical route of hormones and surgery, we develop other signifiers of our womanhood., ones that can't be taken off at the end of the day. Another trans woman, further down her journey than me, told me once that the steps we take to irrevocably declare our womanhood and forever give up our maleness, the ones that can never be undone, and as consequence of which we suffer, as do all women, is evidence enough of our earnestness of our claim to be a woman.\n\nTBH, I've never been girly girly. I think if I had been born female I would have been a tomboy. Today I legit like only have one pair of heels and one dress I haven't worn in years. I have a minute amount of eye make up and like multiple chapsticks, some coloured. I give out very middle-aged busy, practical, no-nonsense mom vibes. It's all a nice-fitting pair of jeans, comfy shoes, jumper(=sweater), earrings and a little bit of eye make up. C'est tout. And frankly, almost 4 years in to a medical transition, no one gives me a second glance, sees me as a cis woman, and I just have a regular mom life of work and kids and home, etc. Prior to transition I used to work in teaching, now I'm in tech. I like board games but rarely have time to play them, other than family games with the kids on the weekend. I like being me, who is a person who happens to be a woman who is trans. I transitioned as I wanted to be female, not feminine.\n\nAnd yes, I know I was born male, and I know I will never be a cis woman, but guess what, you'd be surprised over the course of my transition how many experiences I have in common with cis women. As someone who was always shunned away from learning anything about women's life until I was in a relationship with a woman, it's like in the course of 4 years I have had to catch up on all the lessons I missed out on. There has been so much to learn and experience for the first time and there is more to come. It feels like home and I should have been here from day one. But just like cis women have all different personalities, so too do trans women. And my experience of the last year has shown me that people can be right face to face with a trans woman, and not know she was born male. There is just this assumption that everyone you come across in life is straight and cis, until you have evidence to believe otherwise.\n\nAnyway, I am not sure what the point I am making with this post, only to say that I am respectfully very happy to be here and am grateful for those who welcome me.",
         "The assumption that the *only* way trans women are exploring womanhood is through makeup and clothing is wild. Those are visible cues; a lot of the other exploration and work that they are doing isn\u2019t going to be visible in a social media post. So these people are assuming they understand your whole experience based on how they think you look. Super ignorant. \n\nLike others have noted, this kind of thing is a shared experience among women generally, though I think it\u2019s probably uniquely pronounced for trans women. But honestly, having your gender performance be criticized for being too X or not enough Y is a shared experience among all women, so it\u2019s truly giving that puberty experience. \n\nAlso like \u2018real women don\u2019t get all dressed up like that\u2019 uh some definitely do. I have various cis women friends who love to wear high femme, even glam, in public on a normal day. Because they love it. I personally don\u2019t, but it\u2019s objectively false to say \u2018real women\u2019 don\u2019t do that.",
         "I'm sorry there are people criticizing you for those things, that is silly. \n\nAs a cis woman who has always struggled with feeling like a woman (because of not meeting typical beauty standards), please be cautious with your assumptions and language. Just like no trans people are perfectly alike or share the same experience or viewpoints, cis women are quite varied. I didn't feel comfortable in my femininity or exploring it until much later in life as well. \n\n\"Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle.\" \n\nThank you for sharing your experience.",
         "The irony of your post is you are denying cis women's experience OF THE EXACT SAME ISSUES.\n\nSorry, but you are being treated the same, with some added trans misogyny. Welcome to being a woman. It's wonderful and sucks at the same time.",
         "I know the post you are talking about, it was about a woman who's friend transitioned and started talking about very feminine things \"all\" of the time. Not the very offhanded comments that pile up that you are saying it was. It was a vent post because her friend's interests entirely switched over to something neither of them used to care about, and her frusterations she didn't have anything in common with her anymore. \n\nYou could have been respectful to the original poster and just made your own vent post without shitting on it instead of framing someone slowly losing their friend because they don't have anything in common anymore as part of an anti trans agenda",

If you want to learn Physics you start with Newton, move on to Einstein, then wrap up with Hawking. You don\u2019t start with Hawking. It would be overwhelming. \n\nPlus hair, nails, makeup, and clothes can be really, really fun. In fact they\u2019re some of the best parts of being a woman and I don\u2019t blame anyone for being more drawn to self expression. \n\nHugs.

Not to even start on 'allies' who the minute we make a mistake like every person does or we are no longer of service or we make them insecure because we achieved passing and feminine traits then throw us under the bus.

         "I think there's some nuance being lost in some of the debates here. \n\nWhen a cis woman is told she's not a real woman, it really means she's being a \"bad woman,\" i.e. performing womanhood poorly. When a trans woman is told she isn't a real woman, it really means *she's literally a man.*\n\nI don't think anyone is trying to play oppression olympics. It's just a case of the same words having different connotations depending on who they're being spoken to.",

Not everyone is interested in those things, but there's this really cool thing they can do called politely ending a conversation and walking away. I think it's really nice that you're getting to enjoy painting your nails! My personal favorite are gel manicures, because they last awhile and they don't need as many expensive fillings as acrylics. There are also some really fun movies and shows about girlhood \"Mean Girls,\" \"Ugly Betty,\" \"Legally Blonde,\" and most Hillary Duff movies like \"Cadet Kelly\" and \"A Cinderella Story,\" they all kind of have that silly, light, girlhood vibe.",
         "Sounds like you're having a tough time of it and have had some bad experiences so i'm not going to pick your points apart. I think as cis ppl we could do with better understanding people transitioning are going through puberty.\n\n\nHowever, i do feel like I have to point out that people constantly comment on how women (cis as well as trans) portray themselves. Whether they are being too feminine or not feminine enough. Whether they are wearing too much makeup or not putting in enough effort etc. Unfortunately all women have background anxiety from this and probably spend too much time trying to work it out. The stress of office wear!\n\n\nI don't agree with it but I think when cis women are criticising you\u00a0a) they have they have an internalisef critical voice in them policing all women and b) they resent the strictness of that voice so don't like feeling like their lived experience is being reduced to aesthetics. People shouldn't be criticising you and making you feel shitty. This is just my perspective on what may be going on in their emotions when they do.\n\n\nKeep experimenting with your aesthetics. I hope you find the right balance for you that makes you feel good as a woman.",
         "Something I find baffling is that some cis women can accurately call out toxic behavior in men, but can't identify if they themselves are being similarly toxic towards trans women.\n\nLike if a man tells a woman that he doesn't like her outfit, she'd have every right to tell him to go fuck himself.

         "I have a cousin who's a trans woman. (On my dad's side. His sister.) She went through hell after CPS took her away from her dad after her mom died (he was a total piece of shit) and then he died as well. (Either heroin or pain killer overdose. She was ten at the time.) Her foster mother is a huge transphobe who did... Awful things to my cousin. So when she contacted my mom she already went through around 8 years of transphobia and isolation. (There's a lot of details that I don't know. I'm not going to pry them out of her.)\n\nSo when she met us in person for the first time in 14 years she apologized for not shaving beforehand, and for not wearing dresses or make-up. She said something like \"I know I don't look like a girl.\" She felt like she *had* to look like a girl for us to accept her as she is. \n\nShe felt bad for not \"looking feminine\" enough for us. She looks a lot like her mom, even without HRT. She always had more of her mom's facial features than her dad's. When she started taking HRT I started crying after a few months because of how much she looked like her late mother.\n\nI will never, *ever* know what it feels like to be trans. I can't even imagine it. But from talking to my cousin alone it sounds like there's a lot of pressure on trans people to actually \"look the part\" even more so than cis women.",
         "I'm a trans woman and this is a multi-faced problem. Its complex and has no easy solutions unfortunately.\n\n1. The usual dishonesty of transphobes.\n2. A lot of cis women seem unaware at the rituals and performances they do, and when they see a trans woman doing it, it seems 'fake' but they are doing the same thing.\n3. The lack of sophistication of newly transitioning women have. It take a long time to learn style, appropriate outfits for the occasion, makeup in general, shoes, etc. Its very, very easy to make missteps. Its very easy to get it wrong and stick out. Its very easy to be bullied or invalidated for this.\n4. Newly out girls are really joyful and want to celebrate. They may overdo it, which is entirely reasonable. If you've never worn clubwear before its exciting to do so. Or dive into feminism or women's authors and women's tv shows and movies they didn't get into as much as before for a variety of reasons. This may come off as annoying to others, and perhaps it is, but its actually an expression of joy and loving one's self. Queer joy is a real thing and maybe hard to explain to cishet people.\n5. Newly out girls may have their first authentic sense of sexual and romantic connection. Previously presenting wrong and suffering from dysphoria meant those things didnt work well. To outside observers they may come off as boy (or girl) crazy. When in fact, its the first time in their lives they can actually love how most people love, and be loved. I just spoke with a trans woman going on her first date as herself with a man. She sounded absolutely giddy!\n6. A lot of people don't have a close friend of family member who is a vulnerable identity. White cishet families or friend groups suddenly finding themselves with a trans sister or trans friend is something they have trouble handling because of their own entitlement and ignorance of what its like being with vulnerable people and how  they may act, their politics, and what they do for survival. They may default to hateful right-wing narratives out of their own ignorance, and in many cases not even realize they are being ignorant or hateful.\n7. A lot of us are very protective around cis or cishet people, even those who code as allies. I don't know how to say this but what queer people say to queer people can be very different how we talk to cishet people. For example, the only cis person I've talked about my longing for pregnancy (which is impossible) is my therapist. I can't think of anyone in my life who wouldn't find offense or humor in that admission which is something that pains me greatly, so I don't talk about it and a million other things I think cishet people might struggle with. The same way racial minority people may say things to each other they wont say to a group of white people. Your experience of me may be superficial because I put up a lot of boundaries and only open up to safe people.\n\nSo I don't know the fix here other than we need to teach people to be more patient with the newly out, teach and normalize trans issues and people, etc. This has been a thousands year old struggle and won't be fixed today but we can make progress for us and for future generations. I hope we are able to change our culture for the better, not only for us, but for the unborn trans people yet to come.",

Just look at porn, you can get any flavor woman you want. Big titted Asian? Thousands of tags. Skinny white girl om scrubs? Done. Part of being a woman is that assholes will only look at you and see a sex object. And that really really sucks. \"What were you wearing when you got raped?\"  Is really the same as fetish, because clearly the woman wearing a skirt and walking home wanted to fuck, of she didn't, why was she wearing that? Anything a woman wears can and has been fetishized, despite the wearers intentions. I have definitely been told that I'm only wearing something or interested in a male hobby for the attention, which is really just a subtle way of being told I'm a fetish. \n\nYou get to be upset that people don't consider you a real woman. But Let's not forget that literally right now people are trying to strip away female rights in a way to dehumanize them, make them completely reliant on men, and don't even consider their lives more valuable than a dead fetus rotting in their womb. My grandma couldn't get a house or credit without a man, despite working her entire life and being the strength that held their family together when her husband died young. Family annihilators do so because they see their wives and children as extensions of themselves that they get to treat however they please. Right now, men are forcing their wives and daughters to vote the way they want, because they don't trust them to be smart enough to choose for themselves. \n\nSo maybe don't come here and act like your new found criticism is coming out of nowhere or is specific to you. Women as a whole have been dealing with it since the dawn of time. To an alarming amount of men we are barely considered human and aren't worth more than livestock. \n\nIt is new to you, just like painting your nails is new to you.

My hair wasn't thick enough, I had too much tummy, my nose was too big, my boobs too big, my hips too big, my interests not girly enough, my interests were too girly, I didn't eat enough, I ate too much, I don't wear makeup, I wear too much makeup, at the same time I was a prude and a slut. I'm a bad driver because I'm a woman, I'm bad at math because I'm a girl, and on and on and on.

      "text": "I was on my way home from work by metro when this happened. I accidentally made eye contact with a guy who was walking towards me, he said hi and I said hi back because I thought it was because of the eye contact. He sat in front of me and started talking, and that\u2019s when I noticed he was a big guy wearing a shiesty and didn\u2019t look friendly. I\u2019m Chinese so I pretended like I don\u2019t speak English and just ignored him, but he wouldn\u2019t stop talking. He was saying he wanted to marry me, wanted my number etc. I was scared, I froze and didn\u2019t know what to do. \n\nThat\u2019s when a lady with a daughter that\u2019s about 4-6 years old stood up for me and told him that I didn\u2019t want to talk to him. He told her something like that\u2019s not her business and kept talking to me. I still ignored him. And then he started talking to the lady that he was gonna \u201cbeat the shit out of her\u201d and that he was in prison for 20 years and didn\u2019t mind going back. He continued to talk to me, and I just ignored and tried to text my friend. I then heard him making up bs about the lady, saying that her husband dumped her and that she could never find a man because she\u2019s a bitch. I can\u2019t remember exactly what he said. But it\u2019s a bunch of really terrible stuff. All in front of her daughter who\u2019s just a little kid. \n\nIn the end I stood up and went to another cabin and she went there soon after. I apologized to her and told her she didn\u2019t deserve that, and she just smiled and said that it\u2019s ok and that\u2019s just crazy people. She was so brave. I would never be able to stand up for a random woman if I was at her position. I keep thinking about what could I have done differently to avoid that from happening. Maybe I just shouldn\u2019t have said hi. Maybe I should\u2019ve left earlier, but I just didn\u2019t want to escalate things or pissing him off. Maybe I should\u2019ve called the police or security but I was so scared that he found out I do speak English. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t have pretended like I don\u2019t speak English and should\u2019ve just told him that I didn\u2019t want to interact with him. I was so, so scared that I didn\u2019t do anything right. \n\nIf this lady can see this post, I just want to let you know how sorry I am that I involved you and your kid in this because I wasn\u2019t brave enough to stand up for myself and that thank you so much for what you did.

She didn't speak the local language and he started talking to her in English. She was obviously not interested and uncomfortable. \n\nI told the dude off and told him to leave her alone. He claimed it was just for fun and I countered with who is it fun for? He then spent the next few mins asking his friends if what he said was wrong in a way that made sure I heard him. He clearly didn't think so, but I hope that he thought a little more about it for next time. \n\nMy kid was nervous about it and a little worried. But we made time after to discuss why it's important for that sort of stuff to be checked and that what really should have happened is his male friends should have told him to cut it out. Because they are the ones he's most likely to listen to. And that when my son grows up, I hope he is brave enough to go against the grain when/if his friends ever start talking shit or being dicks. \nI also told my son that a few years ago I wouldn't have been brave enough, but now I am beyond letting shit slide in certain contexts. I felt confident that with so many people around he was unlikely to get physically violent with me and the fact I was with a kid was a bit protective too. Not 100% safe of course but a calculated risk. \n\nThat dude who harassed you and her is the problem, you did nothing wrong and neither did she.",

Luckily I've become older and wiser and realized it's not my job to cater to their fragile egos. I need to look out for myself. Nowadays whenever I find myself in a similar situation I will immediately get up and walk to another cabin with confidence. I have also drawn attention to scary situations by loudly saying, \"This man is harassing me. Please leave me alone.\" Usually they become self conscious when other passengers are staring at us and they stop. Don't be so hard on yourself, but take this as a learning opportunity. With more practice speaking up you will find your voice. Remember you don't have to be nice.

One of the reasons is that situations like yours make us feel helpless - and by obsessing over what we could have done differently, we (clumsily) try to upkeep the idea that we can prevent this from happening again.\n\n\nThe thing is that these thoughts just hurt us, put us on trial and demand for us to be superhuman *literally* in the exact same moment another human being decided to be the worst possible version of themselves. That is a completely unfair standard and you do not have to apply it to yourself.\n\n\nYou *get* to be overwhelmed, scared and incapable of dealing with this. It shouldn't happen in the first place.\n\nBut as a survivor of multiple assaults and the PTSD one gets from that, who has been in both your and this woman's shoes, I am so very, very happy to say that you might very well one day be her.\n\nWe all can be - if we put the blame where it should be:\n\nWith the men who won't leave us alone.\n\n\nPS: And even if you're never that woman, that is okay. The whole point of taking care of each other is so the ones who hurt more get more protection. That's what community is, that's what kindness is. Sometimes we need help, sometimes we give it. That's a beautiful thing, not a flaw.\n\n\nI'm sending you all the warmth I can muster. You did nothing wrong!",
         "Women are not responsible for the actions of a man. Maybe if you did X or if you did Y, things would have gone differently. That doesn't mean you did anything wrong. That also doesn't mean you could have prevented this.\n\nIt was the woman who decided to get involved, and as a woman, she knew the risk. She's likely been there herself. She showed her daughter bravery and strength because in a few years, that daughter will need it too.\n\nYou do whatever you need to do to be safe. That's what matters.\n\nStanding up for yourself is sometimes harder than standing up for someone else. That woman didn't deserve this, but you sure didn't either. It was out of your control.

She might appreciate a 'thank you', though!",

         "Wow, this kind of reminds me of a situation I was in a few years ago. I was studying abroad in France, and one night, around midnight, I was walking back home after hanging out with some friends at a bar (and we'd only had mocktails so I wasn't drunk or anything). After we got on the subway we'd all gone our separate ways so I was walking back down this residential street alone, about maybe 5 minutes away from my apartment when suddenly I heard footsteps running up behind me and I turned around. It was some guy and he stopped and apologized for startling me. Then he started walking with me and I didn't really know how to feel about this since he wasn't being overtly creepy but I also didn't really want him around, so I just pretended I didn't speak French. Well he just as easily switched to English so I just sighed and decided the next best thing was to be short with him and give him one word answers to all his questions. Again they weren't super invasive or overtly creepy, things like \"how old are you? Why are you in France? Oh you're studying, what do you study?\" so I figured maybe being cold and kind of \"bitchy\" would make him go away, but it didn't so eventually I just started outright ignoring everything he said. Except he still kept walking with me and asking why I wasn't answering him. We were getting kind of close to where I lived at that point and I didn't want him to see it so once we got to the end of the road I stopped and turned to him and asked directly \"are you following me?\" and surprisingly he actually said yes. So I just said \"stop, leave me alone\". To which he actually said okay, and then turned around and left. I kept turning around and looking for the next few minutes but it turns out he was really gone. Once I got back into my apartment and started thinking about it, I started to feel bad. I started thinking \"maybe he just saw that I was alone and wanted to help me, maybe he was just socially awkward, maybe it was a language issue, maybe I was unnecessarily rude to someone who was just trying to help me. After all, if he was really a bad person intending to hurt me, would he have left me alone when I told him to?\"    \nIn the end nothing bad happened and I guess I'll never know what his intentions were but your story just reminded me of that. I kept telling myself that I was making it out to be worse than it was and that I shouldn't have felt uncomfortable or creeped out by it.",

What works in one situation may fail due to completely random variables outside our awareness or control. \n\nAnd some men will absolutely go ahead no matter WHAT we do, and harm us anyway. \n\nI am sorry to say it like that, because it\u2019s completely depressing and terrifying. \n\nBut I don\u2019t know a single woman who hasn\u2019t had this experience. \n\nAnd none of us were victimized/harmed because we had the wrong instinct or didn\u2019t handle it well. \n\nIt\u2019s that there are actually a lot of men who see women as something they\u2019re entitled to, and there are a lot of men with uncontrolled rage, contempt for women, men who do not see us as people. \n\nSo all we can do is our best. Follow our instincts in the moment. \n\nIt\u2019s fucking sad bc OP thinks she went wrong by smiling - well the fact is that YES TOO MANY ENTITLED CREEPS have ROBBED us of the ability to be polite and friendly and kind, without immediately punishing us as though that was a promise, and then raging at us when we don\u2019t deliver. \n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean she should feel like she did something wrong by smiling. It\u2019s our cultural instinct is to smile, greet, be friendly, in a lot of places. And it *shouldn\u2019t* be a problem. \n\nAnd when it is, it\u2019s because we had an unfortunate encounter with a man who hunts women (to one degree or another). \n\nIt\u2019s just really hard - women have to scrutinize everything they fucking do and it\u2019s exhausting and unsustainable. \n\nWe can\u2019t be perfect and there\u2019s no way of knowing what will set some dude off. NOT smiling or being friendly sets plenty of dudes off too. Enraged to be ignored.",

And freedom just isn't about the State, it's about your culture and family and faith as well.\n\nIf you want a stinging indictment of the left, talk to ex-muslims. The left hates on them, Islamists hate on them, etc.  It's no wonder that many are drawn to the right when the left gaslights them.

I never said i know more than her, just that i did actually study it and research it, which means i'm not just coming in with no knowledge and asking all muslim women to remove their clothing etc. i see protests in Iran, i support the women and girls. that's all there is to it."

      "title": "The longer I live with my dad, the more I understand why my mum was so angry all the time",
      "text": "I still live in my parents' house, while I'm doing a PhD. They wanted me to stay with them to save money. Last March my mum died; she had developed sudden and fast-moving motor neurone disease just a few months before, and she went from living a full and busy life to completely bedbound in no time. It was horrific, and I'm still struggling to deal with it all. We were very close.\n\nBefore she died I was already very nervous about living with just my dad, because he is Difficult. He's 81, definitely showing signs of some kind of dementia for many years but he's deep in denial, and he was already hard to deal with before that. When he's happy he's fine (mostly), but he can be really difficult to live with. He assured me I was fine to stay with him as long as I needed, and honestly with my limited income and the fact I have a dog to look after (inherited from my mum) I don't really have an alternative at the moment.\n\nBut I wish so much that I did, because every day living with just him I understand more and more why for most of my life my mum was often so frustrated and angry. He is maddening and thoughtless and cannot even consider the idea he might be in the wrong, ever. It makes me want to scream constantly, and if I do then everyone acts like I'm crazy for overreacting and making a fuss, when actually I've been keeping it together for ages against impossible odds.\n\nWhich is what my mum was often like as well. I never fully understood it before. I knew she got frustrated with him, but I never realised how unappreciated, unheard, and powerless she must have felt all the time. It's like screaming at a brick wall. I am exhausted and depressed and furious all of the time. 90% of my therapy sessions are about him and trying to just get through every day not knowing what insanity awaits me when I get home.\n\nSometimes I come home and he's dumped a bunch of random stuff in my space for me to tidy up. Or he'll be trying to cook and he'll use ingredients I bought and make something disgusting, while I try to tell him I can't eat what he's making because it will make me feel sick, and then he leaves the kitchen in an absolute state that I have to clean up. Or he'll corner me and try to pressure me to meet and be chummy with the woman he started dating THREE MONTHS after my mother died, despite me telling him multiple times I'm not ready and I don't know if or when I will be.\n\nEven just having a regular conversation with him is exhausting, because he doesn't listen and he doesn't remember. I'll tell him something 10 times. I'll explain something clearly and he'll get confused. We go round and round in circles with me just trying to ask how his day was, or what he's doing that evening. He never asks what I've been up to or what my plans are.\n\nI'm exhausted, and I feel so terrible I never really understood what my mum was dealing with every day. She was a buffer between us for years, and she bore the brunt of it. And now I have to take it, and everyone thinks I'm just volatile and crazy like they thought she was.\n\nIt is so unfair that he can just push and push and push and drive me and my mum insane, and we just have to take it. He gets away with it because he's a man, and he's old, and 'that's just how he is', and \\*of course\\* we must be the crazy ones because we're the ones screaming about seemingly tiny things. No one sees the thousand other things that got me to the breaking point. Yesterday I had a breakdown at Sunday lunch and made a huge scene about potatoes. But it wasn't about the potatoes; it was about me working hard to make a veggie meal for myself, and a pudding my brother loves, and then my dad cooked all of the potatoes with the meat so I couldn't have any.\n\nBecause he just doesn't think, and he doesn't care. And being thoughtless is not an excuse; it's the whole damn problem.\n\nEdit:\n\nThank you so much to everyone who's commented with support and advice. I'm getting a few repeated suggestions/questions so I just want to address them here for simplicity if that's OK:\n\n1. I should make him get assessed for dementia again.\n\nI have absolutely no control on this situation. He is physically fit and to most people would appear absolutely fine. I cannot drag him unwillingly to an exam, or trick him into it. I have tried to get my siblings to form a united front, but they are dithering because they don't see how bad it is. I know that eventually something bad will probably happen, and I just have to hope it doesn't involve my dog or any of my niblings.\n\n2. I should rehome my dog and move out.\n\nMy dog in non-negotiable. He and my PhD are basically my two priorities at the moment. My mum and I got him as a puppy, he was always \\*our\\* dog. I have trained him, and cared for him, and loved him for seven years. He is, sad as it is to say, the thread on which hangs my mental health. There is no acceptable solution to my situation that does not involve Bramble staying with me.\n\nRegarding moving out, while I am lucky that because my PhD is in STEM I do get a monthly bursary, it already wasn't very high and this year I've had to reduce myself to part time in my PhD which means half the money each month. I had to go down to part time because I am exhausted and depressed, and I had already lost time being exhausted and depressed. It was basically a requirement of me passing my upgrade viva. Because of that, I am not making enough money to rent anywhere. My uni is in a HCOL area, for miles around. And while I am having a lot of difficulties living with my dad, he does take a few things off my plate by walking the dog and being around in the day when I'm in the lab to make sure he doesn't get too lonely. If I moved out, I would either lose more time every day walking Bramble or I'd have to hire a daily dogwalker - more money I don't have. I also have mobility issues (not enough to qualify for any assistance) so I can't live healthily in a cheap and terrible bedsit. Bramble also doesn't deserve to live somewhere horrible without an outdoor space. I considered applying to be an RA at my uni to get free/discounted housing, but Bramble wouldn't be able to come with me and I can't leave him with my dad without worrying he won't be looked after properly. No, they don't accept ESAs in halls, only official guide dogs - which Bramble, for all his charms, is certainly not.\n\n3. I'm going to fail my PhD\n\nHello my intrusive thoughts made real. I am working so hard. I have thousands of samples and a plan. I'm doing my best. I try to get to campus most days to go to the lab or do other work. I have a good uni support system, my supervisor knows a lot about my situation. And one thing about my dad is he does want me to get my PhD, so he won't deliberately sabotage it at least.\n\n4. My mental health\n\nAgain, I'm doing my best. I'm seeing a therapist, I'm working on mindfulness, I have a support system and I cry to my friends a lot. I'm still grieving my mum, and some days are just really hard. I also have long covid so I'm tired and have a low mood a lot. But I do consider my mental health a priority.\n\n5. Is his New Woman a gold-digger?\n\nHard to say. He met her volunteering through church. He repeatedly insists he's not going to marry her, which is honestly more worrying because he says it every time we argue about her. Most of my siblings (half sibs so different mum) were uncomfortable with how fast he moved on, but were too scared of his response to say that to him - so again, I have to be the bad guy with an opinion. To my knowledge she owns her own house, has enough disposable income to go on cruises and jetset around Europe, and has children and grandchildren, so at the very least she doesn't need my dad's money.\n\n  \nEdit 2:\n\nOK to be clear on this one, yes I'm almost certain my dad has dementia. But my main issue is with his behaviours and traits that he has had my entire life. This is not all dementia - I know everyone is focussing on that, but he is also just a mean and thoughtless man a lot of the time. Sometimes he's very kind and selfless, but he will always revert back to the worst version of himself. This isn't a new thing, and it's not just since my mum died. It's just been exacerbated since then.\n\nAlso everyone telling me to have him committed, call social services, talk to a lawyer to force him to go to the doctor: what exactly do you think happens after I take the nuclear option? Do you think he stays calm and cheerful and doesn't absolutely lose his mind? If he passes the exam again, or if social services think he's fine, or if he gets a better lawyer, do you think I am then left in a safe and stable situation? Could you think this through for a minute?\n\nEdit 3:\n\nPlease, I beg you, stop telling me to put a mini fridge in my room. None of the issues have anything to do with the fridge. When I said he cooked all the potatoes in meat I mean all the potatoes that he cooked were cooked in meat, not that they were no potatoes left in the house. I bought them for everyone to have. I do not mind buying ingredients for shared meals; I am living here rent free I can contribute food. What I cared about was being forgotten. Yes I have my own food and snacks, he respects the fridge boundaries somehow",
      "comments": [
         "I'm so sorry you're in this position. A lot of what your dad is doing does sound like pretty common dementia symptoms, which it sounds like are piling on to of already difficult aspects of his personality. It might be worth seeing if there is a local dementia carers/loved ones group as you're certainly not the only one going through this.",
         "At this point I would try to get him assessed for dementia and if it turns out he's not fully there anymore, get a conservatorship on his assets. This it to protect both of you. There are too many instances of old men being taken advantage of by gold diggers soon after they're widowed. The woman he started dating after 3 months may be a nice person, or may be after his money; you have no way of knowing which. Then hire a caregiver to help you with him.\u00a0\n\n\nAlso to note that if he was like this with your mother all their life, then it's not dementia that's causing his behavior, just making it worse.",
         "I am so sorry that you\u2019re going through this; I wish you a lot of of strength and that you will be able to move out soon. \nI work in mental health care : it sounds like your dad has a difficult personality and maybe his cognitive functions are starting to decline, which is hard for the people around him. I watch this often in our patients. \nTake care of yourself!",
         "Are you me????? My mum died, i'm stuck living with my Dad (and often other family members) because I'm on the waiting list for an accessible property. He will go shopping and buy a load fo shit, block up the fridge, have a go at me for not eating the food in there that either I can't eat, don't eat, or don't even know about because I hardly go into the kitchen. But I can't buy my food becuase he hasn't left me enough room to store it. There's three cupboards, he has one full of tinned and dried foods, another full of teh kitchenware he impulsively buys from Amazon. I have to argue with him to keep the third for me. He will regularly throw out things because he \"doesn't know what they were for\" and often times they're mine. Sometimes I'll ask him where something is, and he'll say he must have thrown it out only for me to find it months later somewhere else.\n\nHe will say yes to helping everyone else, but i'm \"Not his problem\".\n\nI can't watch a film with him, he constantly talks over it. He will ask questions on what's going on whilst the characters are explaining what's going on. He will literally go \"is that the one where (major plot spoiler)\". Well I don't know because I haven't seen it, but is there a point in watching now? He'll then go on and on and on and on at me that it doesn't matter that he's spoiled the film, I'm being silly and should just watch it anyway. If I try and watch movies in my room, he'll follow me and just shout at me that i'm being silly and stupid and to watch the film with him in the living room. If I've watched a film by myself and he finds out, he will get upset with me.\n\nHe has stopped speaking to me for nearly a month because I dared to throw out some of my own belongings that were broken. The whole place is like a hoarder's dumping ground but somehow everyone expects me to fix it, and to talk to him, and to get other family members who add to the problem to understand. I've tried. He doesn't listen. Nobody listens, and they defer to him.\n\nAnd then the ones who do understand who see my side of the story say \"Well can't you just explain to him that\" no he doesn't listen. \"oh but when I said\" yeah he told you what you wanted to hear, closed the door and laughed about what you said with a shake of his head and sat down, seething that anyone dared to tell him what to do. \"But if you just\" let's go back to point one: he doesn't listen. And he will repeat himself over and over and over again to shut down a conversaiton.\n\nOh and he spends so much money on frivelous impulsive shit that he can't afford anything so i'm consatntly footing the bill. And people say to me \"But what's he going to do when you move out\". i don't know, learn to be an adult???\n\nAnd i'm stuck here because despite everyone knowing what i'm living with, nobody sees it as a problem(TM) and i just have to wait for an accessible place to beocme available.\n\nBut, here's the thing that I realised long before my mum died, and it's going to sound harsh. She chose to stay. She didn't put herself or you first. She accepted being treated like this. And when I realised that with my mum, I started having very frank discussions with her, and she never had answers to the question \"Why have you put up with this\". She knew what the future would be like for me and she didn't do anything to prevent it. She stayed. For all the song and dance she did about leaving an abusive relationship in the past, she stayed with my Dad. So... there's only so far my sympathy goes, is what I'm saying.",

         "You need to leave. This man will bleed you dry like he did your mother. My father is exactly like this and my sister lost decades of her life to taking care of him like you are after my also very angry mother died too young.  Once my mother died we all saw why she was so angry and crazy all the time. There was a lot of guilt to work though. Make a plan and move out. Plenty of shared accommodation allows dogs. Your father could easily live another decade.",
         "When my MIL died I took a few weeks off to help my FIL. He sounds very similar to your dad. \n\nI let him know that he needed to go into a semi assisted seniors building where they provide lunch and dinner. He was hoping that someone in the family would come stay with him and basically take over being his caregiver like his wife had. \n\n\nWhy was I the one and not my wife? Because, she still struggles with the mental abuse from when she was a kid. He put down her and her brother and was a selfish and crappy dad and husband.\n\n\nNow, he sits in that apartment and I deal with him mostly (he\u2019s still family) and he talks about apologizing to his kids. I usually say in response \u201cWhat will that do?\u201d or \u201cWill that help you or her?\u201d\n\n\nShe talks to him maybe once a week on the phone.",
         "Wow, are we siblings? \n\nMy dad will ask a question and then when I try to answer it... he has already lost interest.\n\nMy pops could have autism the way he misses social cues, but he actively SWERVES around social cues. He absolutely sees if me or another family member is upset and will avoid what ever room we are in.\n\nBut if he is upset? Holy fucking shit... what a whiney little bitch.\n\nI used to be so scared of this guy. The march of biology tearing his body down cell by cell has alchemized that fear into some rather intense anger. \n\nRather intense.",
         "This will probably get buried, but here is my input:  Most of these comments are offering solutions, which is kind, but not always possible.  So, until one of those solutions is possible, you will need to figure out ways to minimize his impact on you.  Because he will never change.  He was stubborn and self -centered before and it will only continue.  \nAsk your therapist to help you develop better management techniques.  For example, he doesn't listen about your day -so quit trying so hard.  Treat him like you are talking to a stoner or a 3 year old.  You answer, but you don't invest in keeping the conversation going.\n\nSource:  I just lost my much - loved but incredibly difficult mom.  Sometimes you just say, \"oh ok, I will think about that.\" And keep it moving.",
         "If you can go minimal contact, keep your food in your room, maybe add a lock? Stay with friends or other family whenever possible, and just get out as soon as you can. \n\nYou are not responsible for him, his mess or his issues. Repeat that all the time.",

         "I\u2019m so sorry, not man related but I\u2019ve had so much empathy for my mom since she died and I\u2019m really upset that I didn\u2019t see it when she was alive. She had a chronic invisible illness that disabled her and I always kind of wrote her off as lazy or crazy. \u00a0I mean it didn\u2019t help that she parentified me, So I naturally pushed back at all requests for help.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0But now I\u2019m disabled by a different chronic invisible illness and I feel so awful about the insults and the micro aggressions and not believing her, I was telling my friends that I feel like this is my karma. \u00a0Maybe I have this illness because I never believed my mom\u2019s.\n\n\u00a0I hope you can get out of there soon this sounds awful. \u00a0Maybe try to gray rock him as much as possible, and just look at picking up the messes as part of rent you would be paying if you didn\u2019t live there and try to get out as soon as possible",

         "I don\u2019t know how common this is but all the men in my family are the same. They don\u2019t listen if you tell them once.

I have seen family members develop lupus and severe mental health issues and I am not surprised. I know is you have said a lot of reasons for not leaving, none of that matters.

You don\u2019t feel\nThe effects now but they come over time. You cannot control or change your dad. For your mental and physical health I do believe it is imperative to get out. PHD or not.

         "First off, let's be clear; this is not just dementia. That's kind of the whole point. He has always been thoughtless and mean and stubborn and bad at communicating. He's getting worse, but a lot of this is who he is as a person.\n\nAnd I did not choose to be in this situation. I moved back in with my parents after my master's degree while I looked for a job. The job market is so shit that even with a BSc and MSc from two Russell Group universities, I had trouble finding anything and ended up temping. I was applying for better jobs and PhDs the whole time. Then the pandemic happened. Then I finally got offered my dream PhD: fully funded, female supervisor, incredible university, my perfect subject of interest. Less than a month before I started my PhD I was hospitalised with Covid. I got back on my feet and got to work and was doing well. I worked incredibly hard, despite my long Covid. Then my mum got sick, and my brain was all over the place and I wasn't getting as much work done as I wanted to because suddenly I had no mental energy. I had been breathless from long covid for a long time but now the brain fog really started to kick in. My mum died and I took time off. She told me on her goddamn death bed that I had to stick to my PhD; I had to get it. My whole world collapsed and I had to climb out of the pit of despair with my dad throwing rocks at me every few feet. I nearly lost my PhD but I fought tooth and nail to keep it. Literally the only comfort I've had in any of this is my dog, and you want me to get rid of him? He would die of sadness, and honestly so would I.\n\nI am not angry that he has dementia. I am angry that he is mean, and thoughtless, and selfish, and uncaring. I am angry that he has never apologised to me once in his life, that he cannot admit he is wrong, that he cannot even consider someone else could have a valid opinion. I am angry because he is 81 years old and he doesn't know how to be a functioning adult and my siblings have left it to me to bear the brunt of his problems. I am angry because he doesn't care how his actions affect other people.",
         "Awe thanks! My mum called him that because she said he looked like a blackberry",
         "If I tell him he's thoughtless and his actions are hurting me he'll say 'no I'm not'. One time a while back he said some stuff that really hurt me and I told him I had lost respect for and trust in him, and he would have to earn them back. His response was 'no I don't'. He just does not care about these things",
         "I say this not to diminish your experience, but stubborn and mean are part of dementia symptoms. Almost everything you described is. \n\nYou need support. Talk to your university and any local groups for dementia support.",
         "My dad is like this. Honestly before I was able to go NC, I just avoided him. When he confronts you just gaslight him, tell him you don't know what he means, he's acting kinda weird (did he get enough sleep? does he need a nap?) - just invalidate everything he's saying and play dumb. \\*Don't\\* give an emotional reaction. People like this feel like eliciting emotions means they've won.\n\nI would leave the kitchen until he cleans it up. If he gets upset, just play dumb and say that you thought he was gonna go back and make more. If he asks you to clean it, say that you would love to but you've got a meeting. If he wants you to meet his new gf, just say that you would LOVE to but you don't wanna intrude on their time or you are SO SORRY but you just have a deadline you have to make that happens to be that day. Just keep repeating that kinda thing over and over again. I truly found that to be my only defense against my dad.\n\nSometimes it will be the case that you have to eat shit and just clean it or grit your teeth, but these little ways of fighting back without 'fighting back' were empowering for me. Play Dumb and Grey Rock.\n\nEdit: This is, of course, under the assumption this is all intentional. Even if it's not, this can still help you deal with angry, dementia patients. Just use placating words/tone of voice without giving in.",
         "Question - could you get a small fridge for your room? Just so you have food that he will not have access to? Not eating properly will also negatively affect your mental health so maybe this one thing could help and then you also have control over that piece.",
         "You should definitely push back on the doctors if his behaviour gets worse. My Grandma has been in a care home for 5 years with dementia and her short term memory is pretty good. Whenever we visit we get all the gossip about who is who in the home. However her dementia really affects her behaviour meaning she could no longer be trusted to look after her self.",
         "Was he assessed before or after your mom died?  It may have accelerated after your mom passed away, that's kind of common to see when a person loses a loved one that was providing the structure to their day.",
         "Meet her alone and tell the woman he has dementia and will need constant care in a few years.",
         "Yeah precisely.",
         "I\u2019d ask one of your siblings for a \u201cvacation\u201d when it\u2019s possible with your school work. Ask them to come stay with him while you go stay at their place or a friend\u2019s. Have them witness it themselves.",
         "As someone who comes from a complicated family situation and was forced to move back with them for a few years, I really feel that. \nAnd it sucks that your family members do not see the need to take some actions.",
         "I'm so astounded to see all these stories of women realizing after the fact why their moms were so angry and seemingly irrational, and I empathize deeply with the guilt you all feel.\n\nI've had the good fortune(?) to have a mom who keeps marrying and divorcing these kinds of men, and I've known since I was about 13 why she seems so angry while she's with them. But it makes me incredibly angry at HER for staying in those situations for as long as she does, because her anger and short fuse impacts her children more than just about anything else going on in the house. I think about that every time reddit loves to rag on people for recommending leaving a bad relationship (\"rEdDiTtOrS aLwAyS lEaP tO sAyInG dIvOrCe hurr durr\").",
         "That\u2019s nice. \n\nIt really sounds like you\u2019re keeping very engaged with this house.  If you\u2019re tidying for him as well as yourself, I hope the value of the time doesn\u2019t exceed the value of rent. \n\nI\u2019ve lived with people who I couldn\u2019t trust with my stuff, they were just too careless.  \n\nOne way to handle this is to have a single session of batch cooking each week, when everyone else can stay out of the kitchen.  Bring home the ingredients, then immediately cook and pack meals for the week into opaque containers.  \n\nA small chest freezer is a great little investment for storing food in your room, or in an out of the way corner.  The temperature stability makes the food keep well.",
         "My dad's 3rd wife divorced him after i told her a bit about why i don't talk to him. Just lost those rose colored so fast. The marriage didn't last a year.\n\nI find it funny that's now trying to repair our relationship, but my 1 sibling who still has a relationship with him knows idgaf and doesn't pass on dads messages",
         "So live with your decision. But you are in no place to guilt trip a troubled young woman about a pet!\u00a0",
         "Oh wow, that made me tear up. If you want to DM me, I'm here if you ever need to talk. Also, talk to your favorite professors, let them know you are looking for a place, the ability of teachers to network is legendary. Also, the assistants to the Dean in the front office of your college are incredible resources and they thrive on finding solutions for their students.",
         "Exactly this. I don't really regret abandoning my graduate work, what I value the most is how different and positive my interactions with others became after I got out and got into therapy. Nobody knows the real you while you are a living like this, you will literally just come across as a crazy bitch, and you know why? Because your life IS fucking crazy!! Get out. Find yourself. Your dad can go fuck himself and your siblings need to step up.",
         "I meant so that your therapist can help you process and understand his condition better.",
         "Yup. My uncle had no will when died either. Some people think they\u2019re immortal.",
         "I\u2019m going to tell you something you will not like. You will not change your father. You will not fix him. You will not change your relationship with him unless you leave. I\u2019ve been through this and I thought I could make things better with my mom. Your life is important and you can\u2019t get back time once it\u2019s gone. You can walk away just like your siblings did. So what if he stays with this new woman and leaves her the house? No house in this world is worth the sacrifice of your precious life. You said that your mom\u2019s last wish was for you to finish your Phd, not take care of your father. I think maybe you want to fix him because it will make up for your guilt about your mother. No, listen to your mother, put yourself and your studies first. Keep your dog. There are solutions and you are a smart person, you\u2019ll find solutions when you let go of trying to fix your dad. There\u2019s nothing wrong with trying to be compassionate but not at the cost of your own dreams.",
         "Your approach will result in a filthy house and lots of yelling. Doubtful that an unstable, selfish 80-year-old is going to experience some kind of epiphany. Much better to get away, if at all possible for OP.",
         "I know it's not your fault but I need people to stop suggesting this \ud83d\ude05 I think I phrased the food thing badly. He has a weird amount of respect for the separation of the fridge shelves, so that's fine. It's more that if something's in the freezer or the cupboard he thinks he bought it. There were raw potatoes left yesterday, what I meant was he was in charge of cooking the potatoes and he only made ones I couldn't eat, which is what upset me. I eat at least two proper meals a day, I meal prep and batch cook. I'm a very good cook and I make balanced and filling meals for myself. That's not really a concern. The only reason I wouldn't be eating properly is if I'm having a depressive episode and don't even have the energy to throw something in the oven",
         "Yeah sadly I have no say in this. I'm the youngest of his five children, he doesn't take me seriously. I can't exactly physically drag him to the doctor or trick him into an exam. Eventually, I know, something big and unpleasant will happen and then things will escalate. That could be avoided if he listened to me, but he won't.",
         "Before, but there's no point telling him that, he won't believe it!",
         "If you have strong reasons to suspect that his judgment is impaired by dementia or something similar, he doesn't need to agree. You could talk to a local lawyer and see what your options are.",

They get ragged on for having an untreated mental illness they \"refuse to treat\" when they've just been gaslit and scape goated for 50+ years ... even if they have or appear to have a mental illness, it may be their only coping mechanism.",
         "I knew my mum was frustrated at my dad, and I knew his behaviour was the reason. I just didn't realise how bad it was",
         "I batch cook already, cause usually I also don't want to cook properly when I get home from the lab. So I'll do one big pot of something and store it, and maybe a couple of quick easy things like jacket potatoes.\n\nWe have a big chest freezer in the garage so I put things in there too - made some mushroom wellingtons at the weekend and froze them.\n\nI mostly only clean my room and bathroom and the kitchen. My room is a mess but it is at least clean which is good. He does the vacuuming every week (the vacuum is too heavy for me to lug up and down the stairs but I have a mini one I use in my bedroom).\n\nI also put effort into making it a nice place to live. I like baking, so I like to have a cake or cookies on the go for whoever drops by (and often take them to uni as well for hungry and stressed students) and I have a lot of house plants that make the place look more welcoming, among other things. I don't let him water or mess with my plants though!",
         "Thanks that's really kind of you!\nDean is not so much a thing in UK unis, plus my campus is a weird one that's separate from the main university. But has the benefit that I know all the staff pretty well. They all love Bramble, if they could let him live here they would. I'm just not in a position to move out right now, for so many reasons, unfortunately",
         "Oh I see sorry. Yes that's sensible. I have discussed it with her before!",
         "Thank you. I know I can't fix him, but subconsciously I still try.  It's good to be reminded of it. Right now I just have to endure",
         "Yeah unfortunately that would not work. I've tried. I refused to clean the kitchen sink for over a week once to see what he would do, and it just built up with food scraps to the point it smelled of vomit and I had to cave and deep clean it. He doesn't notice these things. He also has terrible food hygeine and I would probably end up with salmonella or a parasite if I didn't spray down the counters and rewash the cutting boards. I've tried to explain it to him, but he thinks wiping a wet rag over a counter on which he was cutting up raw sausages and then rinsing the knife is absolutely fine.\n\nI am also definitely not opening the door to meeting his New Woman. I said to him the other day (when he tried to invite her to a family dinner) that even if I ever did agree to meet her, it wouldn't be at a family dinner it would be a short cup of tea on neutral ground with one of my friends there. And he took that to mean I wanted to set that up, so I had to re-explain that I had said IF and I was not agreeing to anything.",
         "I agree, but OP already said that that's not an option.\n\nYour solution is... for her bear the mental brunt of it all? With all due respect, you don't seem like someone who has been in this situation and you're solution of 'leaving' which she *already said* she can't do is unhelpful at best and defeating at worst. We work with what we have in these situations.\n\nUnfortunately, OP is gonna end up cleaning a lot of her dad's shit up and having to go along. But these techniques are non-escalating and can provide some kind of reprieve and *more importantly* a way for OP to feel like she has some agency other than caving every time.\n\nEdited to clarify: It may seem like nothing to you, but the feeling of not giving in immediately really helped me. Okay, sure I have to do what he says but I don't have to do it *now.* I don't know about OP but for me one of the hardest parts was feeling like I had subsume my identity and autonomy to my dad's whims and malicious nature. \n\nOP might have to clean the kitchen or meet the new gf but she can choose to do it on terms that are as much her own as she can make them.",
         "Which sibling does he listen to? If nothing else, get that sibling to talk him into putting the house in a trust for elder-care finance reasons",
         "I haven't any ideas for you, but I want to back you when you write that you can't get help for him when he is unwilling. \n\nMy dad was deaf. If he was still here he would correct that by saying he was industrial deaf. He couldn't explain the difference. He would not get a hearing aid.\n\nI tried everything. I spoke quietly so he couldn't hear, he just rolled his eyes. I repeated everything I said louder to him, so I said everything twice, he didn't care. I told him the dog was going deaf, nothing. I told him he would be able to live independently for longer if he had a hearing aid, nothing. I gave up and got him headphones so I didn't have to listen to his TV.\n\nNothing can force someone into getting medical treatment they don't want. With dementia it will happen but it could be many years away. I'm sorry you are going through this. Take time for you and maybe take up meditation or boxing so you can release the rage.",
         "If she relies on him for housing that may not be a feasible option for her. It takes time and money to declare someone mentally incapable of making their own decisions, and if he\u2019s still able to pass an evaluation it\u2019s not very likely this will work. In the meantime she\u2019ll likely face retaliation for going to a lawyer, and might even get kicked out.",
         "I meant you need a vacation *from* him and one of your siblings come stay to look after him while you\u2019re away.\n\nIf they can\u2019t come stay with him, maybe he can stay with one of them?",

He will die and NOBODY will appreciate what you did for him. They will just sell the house and move on.",
         "Well then, to what extent can you \"grey rock\" during your interactions with him while just doing the drudge work of housekeeping? Would it be possible to for you to work on emotional disengagement and build up some sort of persona that you present when with him?\u00a0\n\n\nMaybe imagine how someone who didn't care about him but had to live there would act and react, then work to be that person when with him while maintaining the home as best you can and working to move your own life forward.",
         "Him going to the doctor repeatedly for eating unkempt food might not be such a bad thing if he is refusing to go get checked for dementia because they will screen him. Even if he goes once you can alert the doctor that he ate bad food and you suspect he's had dementia for a while. \n\nYou can also call APS (or whatever adult services are called) in your area, for resources. They may be able to send someone like a clinical social worker to come speak to him and that person may be able to give a referral if they suspect dementia as well.",

Would your siblings support this? Not sure if this would make him super super angry, but it sounds like he might be a danger to himself and others. \n\nI'm glad that you won't be opening that door.\n\nI hope you can find a way to get him institutionalized or secure a new living situation for yourself. In the meantime, I hope that you take advantage of every opportunity to assert yourself (it sounds like you already are!) and know that you'll make it through. \n\nI'm sure other people have recommended counseling and self-care and I hope that some of those things will help.",

         "Someone posted a quote in here in the last week from some feminist I can't recall the name of saying, 'Men don't feel that they *are* powerful, they feel entitled to power.'\n\nThat pretty much captures it for me.  Men are taught that their opinions are more important and valid than other people's opinions, and it's just How Things Are, so they rarely notice that a bunch of people are not treated the same way.  They mostly believe that their opinions are in fact more valid and important, because that's how other people treat them.  Many cishet men also believe that women should be listening to them instead of to themselves.\n\nThe cultural expectation that men are competent and wise leaders prompts most to behave as though they are, which frequently becomes enough of a pattern that they often assume they simply are those things without needing to put in any particular effort.  This is where Dunning-Kruger effect comes in.  If you are usually treated as though your opinion is important and taken seriously, no matter what you're actually saying, there's little incentive to second-guess or improve any of the thinking that led to you to that opinion.  I don't want to paint with too broad a brush here, there are of course many reasons to your typical male-identified person will want to improve their performance in many areas of life.  But for a lot of men, the boundaries around that growth-oriented attitude and humility are quite dense, and do not bleed over into other areas of life.  So men are likely to be  motivated to critique themselves and acknowledge their limitations at their job, but not at home.  Whereas we all know well how being raised female means you are expected to criticize yourself first in almost all contexts before looking for outside explanations.\n\nAnother way to put this is, the nature of male supremacist cultures pushes women to endlessly question themselves, which is a form of critical thinking and reasoning.  This applies to most areas of life.  So we're used to applying the tools of critical analysis constantly.  We become practiced at it, and it's natural to assume that everyone else is doing the same.  Add on top of that the confidence that most men have, and the general perception is that we're all thinking about all areas of life with similar levels of self-reflection and intention to improve.\n\nBut if most men are turning off that part of their brain when they interact with women in their lives, if they leave their critical reasoning and self-reflections at their job or with their friends/family, suddenly there's this canyon between our thinking and the thinking of most men.  They aren't used to applying those skills in every context, and that flattens their perception of any domain they haven't chosen to apply critical thinking to.  Natural to assume things we don't have much familiarity with are less complex than they are, we all do that.  How much could there possibly be to know about linear algebra, or soil types?  \n\nMost of the time, Dunning-Kruger effect doesn't do us any harm.  It's fine that we just trust the detergent company to know what they're talking about when they say a combination of chemicals we don't understand will clean our clothes, or that our doctor knows more than we do.\n\nBut when it comes to men understanding how women think, and how important their voices are to our conversations, Dunning-Kruger bites a lot of people in the ass.  They're coming in with no understanding, relying on simplistic self-affirming beliefs that they must know better, that women want to hear from them on topics they know little about and have never had a reason to think through carefully.",

Given a significant time gap 5yrs+ it might work out due to individual growth, but keep expectations realistic and if the same behaviors persist, bounce.)\n\n2. Never date your friends exes. This applies for the longer relationships, not just a date once or twice thing. Just messy and could really damage friendships.\n\n3. Never date a friend. If they truly approached with friendship, why risk losing that friendship. And if you approached me under the guise of friendship, the \"friend zone\" was self imposed. If you're interested in me romantically, just fucking say so, because I will not date a friend. \n\n\nSoooo many men have felt very strong negative feelings over rule 3. \"Well how else am I supposed to get close to you?\" Maybe try expressing your interest in me romantically/sexually would be a good start?

And sometimes you just want to hook up once or twice and move on. I\u2019ve stayed friends with people who developed feelings for me and vice versa, and I\u2019ve had friendships fizzle out after one of us admitted we had feelings for the other and they weren\u2019t reciprocated. I\u2019ve had crushes develop, hooked up, then gone back to platonic friends for a decade or more. It\u2019s sad when one or both parties can\u2019t maintain a friendship due to hurt feelings,       but it doesn\u2019t feel dehumanizing to me. Life is messy and relationships and attraction and love are even more so. \n\nNow of course if someone is intentionally pretending to be your friend, doesn\u2019t actually find you interesting or enjoy spending time with you, just because they want to have sex, that\u2019s something different altogether. But I must admit I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve ever had this happen to me.

It hurt her, bad, especially because I did it at a time when all she wanted was for someone to listen.\n\nWhen I saw her at work a couple days later I was confused about why she'd been so hurt by it. She laid it all out for me and I realized what a jackass I'd been. After hearing what she said, I'll never do it again. I wish I'd never done it at all. But the sad truth is I'd done it at least a hundred times before then, and I'd just never understood the damage I was doing.\n\nEmpathy is hard. I think other girls had explained it to me before her, too, but I wasn't in a place where I was capable of understanding.\n\nI don't have a good answer for why I did it or why I couldn't understand. All I can be is sorry, and sorry is all I am.\n\nEdit: Just realized this didn't really answer your final question, about why it's so bad to be friends when you want to date a girl.\n\nHonestly? I'm not really sure anymore. But that's because I've finally gotten what I'd wanted and never had for so long\u2013I have a girlfriend now, where before I'd never felt my feelings reciprocated. Unrequited love is hard, and it's easy to fall for someone if you've never had a deep or meaningful relationship before. Wanting and not being wanted is a unique type of pain.

I ended up needing to be more explicit that I wasn't and then he ghosted me. next time I see him and his friends they're really shitty to me.

         "A lot of guys can't tell the difference between flirting and being nice where women are concerned. Men typicaply dont get a lot of positive attention from the opposite sex in my experience, so that good feeling can be confused with or transitioned into feelings of affection. Someone pursuing you is going to be more attentive and attuned to you by default. Once you express no romantic interest, there's bound to be less of that. I don't treat my friends the same as my partner(though she is my best friend). That being said, that's no reason for them to be outright mean to you or to ghost you. There's probably an initial recoil from feeling rejected as well, but if they really like you and want to be friends then then hopefully they'd come around. I wish you luck in finding platonic relationships,",
         "It really depends on the relationship and their mentality. If someone is trying and putting the effort for a girlfriend vs making friends with someone. A lot of guys do back off because they are looking for a girlfriend however the type of relationship and pursuit they are looking for might be different and changes because of it. This happens in both ways for men and women but it all depends on the person. Some people rather look for a significant other and might be why a relationship changes. In the end don't put much into someone who acts like this since obviously they don't hold you high on their priorities and its not worth your effort to reconcile this.",

Almost every one of my friends is in a relationship so contact with them is limited to specific time frames and situations. I am not looking for more friends, I can\u2019t fit them into my life.\n\nI am looking for a partner and would like to use my free time toward building a romantic relationship not more friendships. \n\nI hope none of the guys I meet think that I view that only as relationship objects, but that is what I am looking for in my life currently so if they can\u2019t offer that then in the interest of my time and my goals I have to opt out.",

Being \"anything zoned\" is messed up. \n\nIf it helps, as a man, I THINK I can help put this into perspective GENERALLY;\n\nImagine finding your person. Whether it be a cute happenstance at the laundry mat, or maybe a CO worker that got put on your team and it turns out you really like them. Not only do you really like them, but DAMN is she/he sexy af! As you talk and get to know each other the more perfect it gets and the more you fall for them.  \n\nThen, you finally get the courage to bring up your feelings to this person and put yourself out there. The day comes and you let your crush know how you feel.... but they unfortunately turn you down and tell you they don't view you sexually or romantically...but they \"still want to be your friend\". Huge bummer. But what do you do now? Most people opt for one of these two options:\n\nOption 1: remain friends. This is LIKELY the better choice that pays out better in the long run but usually VERRRY hard to deal with because now you get to watch your homestar crush date and kiss and talk about alllll these other people to you (because, remember, you're their \"friend\" now and friends talk about this stuff with each other). Now, there are two subroutes this option holds: Route A is you deal with it healthily and let your new friend live their romantic life without you. Totally normal. Route B is.... not healthy and you grow a weird toxic attachment with the mindset of \"well, if I stay friends with them maybe ONE DAY she/he will see my value and come be with me yadda yadda yadda\". Or, even worse, you start finding ways to belittle their boyfriends/girlfriends and basically become \"that person\" who spits hate and gossip and cultivates resentment. It's not good for anyone, including yourself.\n\nOption 2: break contact. This is not a bad option ESPECIALLY if you know yourself to be the kind of person that takes Route B as listed above, or just simply doesnt want to deal with the sadness any longer tham you already currently are. This is a defense mechanism. Nothing more. Sometimes people can present it poorly and it comes off very rudely, but at the end of the day, this person KNOWS that they aren't going to be able to emotionally handle Option 1 and are deciding to nip their emotions in the bud and spare themselves the heartache.\n\nI wouldn't take it so personally. It's sucks, for sure. I've had people like this in my life and been on both sides of this and I'm also the kind of person who usually opts for Option 2 when presented with that scenario. I get very emotionally invested and if someone I'm head over heels for doesn't reciprocate those feelings I HAVE to cut my ties or it will become unhealthy and toxic for both of us. \n\nHope this helps. I don't think it's a \"guy thing\". This is a HUMAN thing.",
         "One thing is that a lot of men don\u2019t have friends the way women have friends, with loving unconditional support. When a woman offers genuine friendship to a man like that, he assumes it\u2019s a romantic thing because it\u2019s deeper than his other friendships or this may even be the only real friendship he\u2019s had\u2014the rest of his friends may just be buddies. So because it\u2019s deeper he erroneously thinks it\u2019s romantic and he ruins the friendship.

         "\"everyone keeps friend zoning me\"  \n\"It's because you are fuck zoning everyone\"\n\nSelf inflicted.\n\nNot that I would take someone like that as a friend.",
         "This is always a fascinating discussion. Men and women just cannot reconcile here.\n\nI cannot comprehend why women find it dehumanizing to have a man you know / like / trust as a friend, to have a romantic interest in you. Why does it hurt to have a person who likes and respects you to also want to share physical intimacy? And why can\u2019t these things exist at the same time for you?\n\nTo men, being friends is good, being romantic partners who are also friends is BETTER. So to us, it often feels like we are advancing the relationship, improving it even. And were often shocked that we read all the signs of interest, but no actual interest in improving the relationship, which can hurt just as much. Being relegated to \u201cI kinda like you but I don\u2019t REALLY like you\u201d doesn\u2019t feel good.\n\nAnd I (41M) have been obsessed with this giant chasm in thought between men and women most of my life. When I was young, my very best friends were women that I was madly in love with, and they just didn\u2019t like me \u201clike that\u201d. When you care for someone in all ways, and they only care for you in some ways, it can feel defeating.\n\nUltimately I think it\u2019s a social issue and the very broad definition of a \u201cfriend\u201d. The way women often define a \u201cfriend\u201d is a relationship that men reserve for romantic partners only. So our guy \u201cfriends\u201d are more like how women define \u201cacquaintances\u201d. So by expanding this, men have ZERO friends, as women define them. So when a woman is friendly with a man, he assumes this is romantic interest because HE ONLY TREATS ROMANTIC INTERESTS THIS WAY.\n\nIf you truly care about this friend, talk to him about it. Don\u2019t assume anything. Try to understand and see his perspective. And you\u2019re not entitled to his friendship anymore than he is entitled to your romantic interest.",

It hurts. I cannot move on from some people. Hell I'm still caught up on a girl I went on 3 dates with in February and haven't spoken to since March.\n\nThere will be at least a portion of the times it happens to you where the reason is that the other person need to protect themselves, when you think that might be the case please try not to see it as they only thought of you as a price of meat.",

I wanted to add a metaphor. \n\nI really love reptiles. absolutely adore them. I dream of having an iguana as a pet. BUT I know how hard it is to take care of them. And I fear that I may accidentally neglect them.  and just the thought of POTENTIALLY neglecting a pet gives me enough dread to choose never to have one. It would crush me emotionally to see something I care so much about suffer because of me.  My empathy is that strong.\n\nExtend that to relationships.  I am surrounded by so many people saying just how horrible men are. and I wont disagree. Ive witnessed it myself.  To a lot of women just having a man talk to her or being nearby her gives her fear.\n\nI dont want to cause anyone fear. fear hurts.    So....  I just chose to never even try to date anyone out of fear that I would cause them distress with my mere presence.\n\nlike the old movie said \"The only winning move is to not play\".   \n\nI can assume that I would of made a great friend to a woman, or that I would of had a great caring relationship.   \nBut the risks are just too high.    I can only assume the \"Good men\" are also the silent ones.   which would become confirmation Bias with all of the \"bad men\" being so loud about their objectification of women.",

I'm nice to them either way. Losing the friendship would be horrible so I've avoided saying anything definitive. \n\nTo me it doesn't make much since to just want to be friends with someone unless you're not attracted to them at all (perhaps they're the wrong gender). Like if you're personality compatible, and you think they're attractive, what else is there? (For the sake of argument, let's assume that existing relationships aren't an issue.)\n\nAnd of course I respect their feelings and don't get worked up if they aren't receptive to my romantic feelings. I assume they know how I feel because I just barely leave room for plausible deniability. \n\nBut I do feel guilty and worry that my feelings make them feel dehumanized.\n\nAm I in the wrong here?",
         "Not to simplify it too much, but men are conditioned to think of women as either sexually available or not sexually available. The world tells us that women who fall into  the first camp are potential mates and women who fall into the second camp (relatives, older women, etc) can be friends (or adversaries). A man's prime directive, according to society, is to spread his seed to as many sexually available women as possible, no matter the consequences. This is largely untrue, but it doesn't feel untrue for a lot of men.\n\nMen also have emotions  and are taught that women will not communicate their desires verbally (sometimes true, because the way that many women are socialized prevents them from asking for what they want directly without fear of being perceived as bossy or picky, subordinating their desires to men's), so they engage with women who are treating them well and assume this is a nonverbal signal that the woman wants a romantic relationship. Many men want a relationship so badly (because it affords them reliable sex, so they think) that they can't see past their desire for sex. They fail to realize that it is healthy to want to be treated well, but not healthy to believe that every woman who treats them well is not an object to be conquered or a potential mate, that in fact most women treat everyone in their lives well because they enjoy interacting with the people in their lives. Some of this is down to testosterone and the profound effect that it has on libido, but a lot of it is baked into the way men, especially young men, are trained to view the world, or rather trained not to question their own motives.",

Whatever reason someone has for not befriending you is just as valid as whatever reason you have for not wanting to date them. We all get to choose what type of relationship we want and with whom. Adults have very limited time and most of us have a hard time seeing our current friends enough. If I befriended every single woman I had a crush on, it would be absurd and I would never be able to maintain a friendship with all of them. So I make choices accordingly, and I don't think this means I should stop seeking a partner just because I don't want more friends. \n\nAlso, staying friends with someone you have a crush on is very often extremely hurtful and emotionally draining.

         "They unfortunately are not aware. The person making that claim was a women who 'went undercover' into male dominated spaces. I copy pasted that chain just a few days ago.\n\n>Simply put, men receive so little positive attention, genuine kindness, and affection from both other men and especially women that if a woman treats a man merely as a \u201cfriend\u201d, with a similar level of intimacy as lady friends, then this is a big spike in affection and positive emotional feedback, which men easily mistake as romantic interest.  \nIf you really want to delve deeper, you may want to check out Norah Vincent\u2019s Self Made Man book which details her experiences during an 18-month experiment \u201cundercover\u201d as a man, infiltrating male spaces (such as bowling leagues or men-only retreats) and even trying to date as a man.\n\nBut aside from that, many men do not, in fact, know better. As in, they literally have not been introduced to the idea, or have been bullied by the people surrounding them into thinking that such an idea is silly and going to get them trampled all over and taken advantage of. Even worse, said state is ENFORCED upon them if they just happen to be born into the wrong group/area. Think of the father who beats the crap out of their son for being too soft. The bully that intentionally goes after others who are less aggressive. The corporate culture. The religions. The politicians. The television. The news.

And this is no accident. They are no happier for this. This is something engineered and propagated by rich elites who found the perfect target for divide and conquer. A 50/50 split right down the populace. Billions are spent yearly to convince men that this is the norm. That if she won't have sex with you, she doesn't truly love you/is seeing someone else/is just using you/etc.\n\nSo the reality is even worse than your could imagine.

         "As a related issue I think this is why in video games having sex is called \"romance\" so often. For example in Cyberpunk 2077 the wiki has a list of \"romances\" and it's just everyone you can have sex with including prostitutes. \n\nBeyond that video game development being such a male dominated field for so long has made it so a lot of the games themselves promote the idea that sex is the same thing as having an emotional bond with someone and is always, always the end goal for in-game relationships.\n\nI say this as an extremely not asexual person but I think this is one reason I liked the Yrliet romance in Rogue Trader so much. She hates being touched so you can't even go as far as holding her hand but you can still develop what I consider to be a real relationship based on understanding, trust, and respect for one another. It's just so different from 99% of video game romances being built *entirely* on your emotional bond without what a lot of people (mostly men) seem to consider the \"payoff\" of physical intimacy.",

         "It can absolutely happen naturally, and that's not an issue. Lots of people find love that way.\n\nThe issue is that a lot of men (not saying it's you, just that it's prevalent) don't actually want friendship with a woman in the first place, but they pretend they do. For them, it was never about being friends - it was all a strategy to \"wear her down\" into eventually saying yes to romance. (Yes, I've literally seen that typed out as advice on how to get a girlfriend.) Even when we make it clear that we're not interested in dating, guys will often say \"let's just be friends then\" and secretly wait for an opportunity. We know the platonic friendship isn't real because, when they eventually ask us out, and we say no... they often blow up at us, extremely angry at \"all the time they've wasted\" being our friend for nothing.\n\nDefinitely read some stories of women who have gone through this with the men in their lives. If you want, I can link some for you. There are a lot of women who finally just give up and say \"Argh, fine, I'm just not going to make any male friends anymore\" because this has happened with *every man they've ever befriended* \\- it makes it feel like the friendship was never real, like the only reason to talk to us would be to eventually fuck us. Again, not saying that's you... but it's enough of a widespread problem that nearly all women can relate to it. (And that sucks, because I *want* to have close platonic friendships with men!)",
         "When I was younger, had a bf, and much more naive, there were a few guys who were my friends but who I also knew were attracted to me (based on comments they made toward/about me or vibes they gave off). I clearly drew the friendship line and they ended up being good friends. But I never knew if they were friends with me because they think they might have a chance in future, or if they really liked me as a person.\n\nAfter either I or they started to completely settle down with our respective spouses, guess what.... We're not friends anymore (even though I've reached out to them since). And it's sad because I miss them, but my question was answered. They don't care about our friendship if there weren't any possibility of a relationship at the end.",

         "> Would you have even wanted me to stick around? \n\nYes\u2026? Are men really this emo? Why wouldn\u2019t I want a friend?",
         "Thank you for sharing your experience so people can broaden their understanding of where this comes from! \n\nYeah, I think men have way more trouble than women with emotional intelligence due to patriarchal expectations. Women are raised to feel responsible for managing emotional states, men are raised to feel like they need to be strong/powerful/in control; they are taught men are entitled to get what they want. \n\nThe messaging in our society is that a \u201creal man\u201d who is powerful and in control \u201cwins\u201d: he gets the girl, gets the money, gets the admiration, respect, the life success.   \n\nSo if a woman is rejecting them, many men *feel*:\n\n(1) desperately desirous of connection and intimacy but don\u2019t understand how to facilitate it effectively since they were never expected to consciously develop that skill;\n\n(2) she is wrongfully withholding something rightfully his; success, respect, love, etc;\n\n(3) she is implying he is fundamentally weak/deficient in some way as a person by her rejection;\n\n(4) frustrated due to their inability to self-regulate emotionally and empathize (see things from her perspective), and; \n\n(5) ashamed (internally conflating how badly it feels to have an unmet need with \u201cI *am* bad\u201d; ie. if I am denied my rights and feel bad like this, it *must* be because I am bad and therefore undeserving).  \n\nWhen 1-4 come into contact with 5 (shame) that\u2019s when things start getting *really* dicey. It\u2019s not that individual men actually feel powerful or in control or that they\u2019ve \u201cearned\u201d a right; many men feel powerless (whether they are, compared to any one else, or not)\u2014 it\u2019s that (courtesy of the patriarchy in which we were raised) they feel *entitled* to power, and it is that entitlement that results in this type of escalation.\n\nWomen deal with shame too, but we have different expectations than men in a patriarchal society, and therefore women in such regions feel less entitlement overall, plus it\u2019s with respect to different things. (Women may feel entitled to be presumed trustworthy with unknown children, and not viewed with suspicion sitting alone near a playground, for example.)\n\nAnyway\u2014 starting an analysis from that point, is it any surprise that so many men lash out in their humiliated fury, unable to tolerate such distress? To withdraw to protect themselves (to defend themselves against an attack, since she hurt them first)?   \n\nTo quote Jess Hill\u2019s book, [*See What You Made Me Do*](https://archive.org/details/see-what-you-made-me-do-the-dangers-of-domestic-abuse-that-hill-jess-author-2020), which focuses on the insecure reactor type of domestic abuser (which is non-strategic), and discusses the how and why, as well as possible systemic solutions:  \n\n>As the feminist writer Germaine Greer notes in her essay On Rage, \u201cA red-blooded man is not supposed to take insult and humiliation lying down. He should not let people get away with doing things he thinks wicked or unjust. He demands the right both to judge and to act upon his judgment.\u201d \n\n>As Bren\u00e9 Brown explains, \u201cShame, for women, is this web of unobtainable, conflicting, competing expectations about who we\u2019re supposed to be. And it\u2019s a straitjacket. For men, shame is not a bunch of competing, conflicting expectations. Shame is one: do not be perceived as weak.\u201d\n\n>Men\u2019s pain\u2014especially in relationships\u2014sounds to us \u201clike an indictment of female failure. Since sexist norms have taught us that loving is our task whether in our role as mothers or lovers or friends, if men say they are not loved, then we are at fault; we are to blame.\u201d This sense of failure for women is a major trigger for shame\u2014an unbearable feeling we desperately want to go away. How much room, then, can we allow for men to be truly vulnerable?  \n\n>Now to the next point: shame is not guilt. Guilt is the feeling we\u2019ve done something bad or have wronged someone. When we have guilt, we can apologize and, if we are forgiven, we may be absolved of our guilty feeling. In contrast, no one can absolve you of shame. You have to do that work yourself. That\u2019s because shame is not just a feeling that we\u2019ve done something bad; it\u2019s the unspeakable (and often deeply buried) feeling that \u201cI am bad\u201d\u2014the feeling that we are \u201cunloved and unlovable.\u201d\n\n>Shame is a concept few people understand, so Gilligan lists its synonyms (and there are dozens): being insulted, dishonored, disrespected, disgraced, demeaned, slandered, ridiculed, teased, taunted, mocked, rejected, defeated, subjected to indignity or ignominy; \u201closing face\u201d and being treated as insignificant; feeling inferior, impotent, incompetent, weak, ignorant, poor, a failure, ugly, unimportant, useless, worthless. \n\n>Domestic abuse doesn\u2019t really start with men disrespecting women. Its roots go much deeper: into men\u2019s fear of other men, and the way patriarchy shames them into rejecting their own so-called \u201cfeminine\u201d traits, such as empathy, compassion, intuition, and emotional intelligence. We need to talk about how, for too many men, patriarchy makes power a zero-sum game and shrinks the rich landscape of intimacy to a staging ground for competition and threat.\n\n>For a while, Bruce used this lack of emotional vocabulary as a kind of power. \u201cIf you\u2019ve only got two modes of communicating with someone\u2014one of which is a polite request, the other being violence\u2014the polite request is the threat of violence. And so you can then maintain the self-image of a person who is unfailingly polite, while everyone responds very quickly and actively to everything you ask for.\u201d",

This is well established. Even if you don't find them attractive, you find them MORE attractive after becoming friends with them. Guy or girl.\u00a0\n\n\nSo given that the average person is, by definition, average-looking, and they are only ever going to become more attractive to you as you become friends with them, then you get the end result that most people consider their friends to be at least above-averahe looking.\u00a0\n\n\nSo, like heuristic said, if you already like a person, are comfortable around them, trust them, AND find them to be at least moderately attractive.... What's left? What else is there?\u00a0\n\n\nAnd then on the second point, making friends as an adult is exceptionally rare. No one is regularly befriending people in the first place. It's typically only done in settings that provide repeated exposure to many people at once, such as workplaces, group activities, or gatherings with existing friends and their friends. In such a situation, all else being equal, if there are many people to choose to strike up conversation with, a person will almost always preferentially try to become friends with someone they dream attractive, over someone they don't.

         "I'm not using it as a trap, I'm using it to hopefully get this commenter to think about it. And, yes, people appear more attractive to us as we get closer to them emotionally, I won't argue that. But there is still a place for strong, purely platonic, emotional friendships.\n\nThink about the difference (generally, culturally) between men and women here. Women tend to be emotionally open with each other all the time. The majority of women are also straight, and therefore not attracted to each other romantically. In other words - we get lots of practice being emotional in situations that are guaranteed to stay platonic, no matter how close we get. Men are not encouraged to do the same, since masculinity views emotions as \"weak\" or \"gay.\" Even using the word \"gay\" as an insult implies that emotional connection = romance.\n\nI'm asking the commenter above to examine his friendships and see how many women he is emotionally very close to, but would decline if she asked for romance/sex. Unfortunately, for a lot of guys, attractiveness is (maybe unintentionally) a requirement before interacting with a woman in the first place.

I'm just explaining why men *seek* sexual validation from female friends. I'm not arguing the ethics of it. Downvote away, it doesn't change reality. But maybe conversations can.\n\nSimple facts: Men who have no sexual confidence (incels) do not feel safe making advances with strangers in bars. Men want to feel validated sexually. Men feel safe with their friends. Men want to feel validated by a friend they know and trust.\n\nYes, I know how that makes women feel. I know that women don't, in general, want to feel sexually validated by the male friends in their lives. But that wasn't the question. The question was \"why.\" I, personally, have felt those urges in a previous decade and had to suppress those urges for my own ethical reasons. I was also a virgin for way longer than any of my friends. I get why guys take those chances... because it feels safer to *them*.\n\nI think there is a disconnect because so much young sexuality separates dating from friendship, that to many young people sexuality in general feels like a dehumanizing experience. But to others, it is an amazingly humanizing experience to connect sexually with a person you genuinely care about: a friend. It's not about what is owed.

         ">  to many young people sexuality in general feels like a dehumanizing experience. But to others, it is an amazingly humanizing experience to connect sexually with a person you genuinely care about: a friend.\n\nYeah, that's the whole problem. Men will pursue their humanizing experience which often means dehumanizing their women friends. It's selfish.",
         "Did you even read the comment? Nobody is entitled to feeling sexually validated. If not being sexually validated causes you emotional distress you should seek therapy. Women are not responsible for your mental health. Women get lonely and horny too and somehow manage not to creep on all their friends",
         "Open communication is exactly what's needed. Honesty is the key. For example, if someone wants compliments because they want to have sex with you, they should be clear about it. And they should also state they think of you only as a potential sex partner - NOT actually a person they want to hang out with, out of friendship, respect and all that. People should be making that crystal clear to each other but that is almost never the case. \n\nSadly, there is a large percentage of women who have experienced nothing but \"friendship\" from men with a hidden agenda: to get laid at any costs. \n\nIt's dehumanising at best, and predatory at worst. Yes, genuine friendships based on respect can bloom into something else and absolutely it's a great way to start a relationship, but it's frustrating and frightening to find that someone you thought was a good friend was only interested in one thing, and actually doesn't care about you as a person. In fact, they're often downright nasty when they get turned down, and the friendship is revealed to be a tool for that person to get laid and nothing else. They don't care about you at all. \n\nWhat's worse is there's a strong correlation between someone who's prepared to lie about why they want to hang out with you, to someone who's not good at taking no for an answer. It stems from a dehumanised view of women. These kinds of guys think women are just prey, and they play devious and clever games to get them into bed, and when those efforts don't pay off... the mask comes off. \n\nHence, women become wary. After all, we get victim blamed so often - why didn't you see that was all he wanted?, etc. etc., and then everyone's left with the shit stick. Trauma, trust issues, generalisations and finger pointing. \n\nIf we could all just see each other as equal humans, take no for an answer, and stop playing manipulative games that'd be greeeeeaaaaat.",

You should look somewhere else.\" Walking that line is a tightrope, for reasons that women don't always understand.\n\nFor starters, It's not an abusive mindset. It's an immature mindset. Boys don't know what to do with their feelings, and people don't teach them how to deal with it. Just a list of things they aren't allowed to do or say. And sometimes, we aren't even taught that, depending on where you grow up. The support structure for boys and young men is abysmal. I do my best, but often that makes people angry with me for presuming to be their life coach. We just eventually either learn or we don't. Since turning 30 that issue hasn't come up among anyone I know my age in the past 14 years. Like I said. It's a maturity issue. It's common with teenagers, college age, and incel groups. The sad virgin types.\n\nMen of adult age don't usually hit on their friends unless they are delusional, on drugs, or they have a valid reason to believe the affection is mutual. The first two groups are terribly difficult to break through to.\n\nEditing because the person who asked me a question apparently **blocked** me before I could reply:\n\nBoys and young men experience *intense* feelings when transitioning from childhood, through puberty, into manhood. We are taught to suppress it all, to keep it to ourselves, to not talk about it, to not pursue it, lest we be lambasted for not being strong enough, by both men and women alike. We are taught that our worth is measured in the ability to endure pain, both emotional and physical, while providing work output and earning the right to call ourselves a man *if* we can measure up. And then, if and only then, will we be deemed worthy of love and companionship.\n\nWhere should we start? How about some compassion? How about some listening? How about, before we get to high school, we start talking to young children honestly and openly about sex, dating, and consent, about *how to approach a girl* if you like her in a way that doesn't make her feel uncomfortable, about *how to deal with rejection* in a healthy way, and about how to walk away from friendships if you are no longer able to maintain a platonic bond due to your own feelings?\n\nIt is absolutely true that nobody is owed sexual validation from anybody. It is also true that nobody is owed friendship. We are males and females of a species here. Sexual attraction happens sometimes, sometimes asymmetrically. That doesn't make it *wrong*. It can be inappropriate. We should be able to talk about it with our friends, and if need be, make an adult decision to walk away from the friendship if it's uncomfortable for one or the other of them, mutually and consensually.\n\nNo, we absolutely should not be telling anybody, of any gender, not to have hurt feelings. Hurt feelings are part of life's experiences. We should support those close to us, our friends, siblings, and children, when they have their feelings hurt, so that they can learn to deal with their feelings. It's all part of growing up.\n\nWhen you teach people to suppress what they feel, it turns into a pressure cooker. And that ain't good for anybody.",

      "title": "My boss was an ass about my pregnancy and now he's being an ass after my return from maternity leave.",
      "text": "I have been documenting our interactions since the day I announced my pregnancy but my boss is a huge asshole to pregnant women and mothers and he's so high up nobody will do anything about it. I reported him to HR during my pregnancy but they just said they \"couldn't find any concrete evidence\" despite all the chat logs I sent them of him being passive aggressive towards me and straight up being cruel. \n\nI had another coworker who recently had a baby a few months before me quit only 3 months after returning from maternity leave. Luckily she was able to find a new job but I'm pretty sure he was an ass to her too.\n\nThe problem is, my boss is the VP of our entire business unit and for the past few years, our business unit has been the only one making profit and keeping the entire corporation afloat so I'm pretty sure he feels invincible, and in a way, he is.\n\nHe was extra mad at me because my state pays for 4 months of leave and it stacks on top of the company paid leave so I got a total of 5 months of leave whereas my coworker only got 3 months of leave and 2 of those months were unpaid so she would be \"motivated\" to return to work sooner. He never clearly admitted that's why he was mad, but he very heavily hinted at it in a non-direct way.\n\nI need my income to support my new family, but I feel extremely vulnerable and frankly a bit insulted that this is how it's going to be. I've done nothing wrong. I'm a model employee. I deliver everything with careful detail and on time. I go above any beyond doing rush projects when necessary. Nobody else has any complaints about me. I'm being punished for having a baby whether anyone wants to acknowledge it or not.\n\n\nEdit: for funsies, I've included my favorite ass moments from this guy. \n\n- I was receiving a lot of praise for my work until I announced my pregnancy, then suddenly my performance was \"subpar\" literally the next day.\n\n- He told me it was inappropriate to start crying when I suddenly started miscarrying during a meeting and that I \"should have just taken the day off if I was having a rough time\" as if I knew I would miscarry that day. Bonus! He knew I was suffering from years of infertility! I got pregnant again 2 months later to his dismay.\n\n- I had horrible HG so I was sick the entire pregnancy. He told me we could reschedule a meeting for the afternoon if my morning sickness was too bad. (This one wasn't mean, just an honorable mention for how out of touch this guy is.)\n\n\n- He complained about how many doctor appointments I had due to very high risk pregnancy.\n\n\n- He gave the project I asked for to his favorite employee because I was pregnant and not as \"reliable\".\n\n\n- He asked my coworker if this was her first baby. She told him it was her second. He responded \"Why would you do that?\" In a very not joking manner. \n\n\n- He is now giving me the silent treatment and very short, rude answers to any questions upon my return. Like a child.",

      "text": "I live in a relative liberal bubble, but today I witnessed two white women being unnecessarily aggressive towards an Asian family at a children's play place, all because two toddlers want to play with the same toy. On top of being verbally aggressive and getting staff involved, they CALLED THE POLICE. They were being hysterical, claiming \"this man and his daughter put their hands on my CHILD!\" (They did, but in a completely harmless way, and they've apologized repeatedly). The Asian dad was trying to explain but clearly getting upset and worked up and it could have ended badly. One of the women who was acting completely entitled also took pictures of the family with her phone. Anyway I was already a ball of anxious fury over the election and time change and everything else so I stepped in to tell the staff what I witnessed and got into a bit of shouting match with the aggressors. Eventually I filled out an incident report and left. \n\nBUT MY POINT IS: When I told my husband what had happened, he said, I'm glad you did something to help. I'm very proud of you. I was stunned by the validation. All my life people told me to sit down and shut up and don't cause trouble. There were so many times when I was a bystander and didn't do anything or didn't do enough, and I still think about it and resolve to do something and say something next time. This time I did. And I'm glad I did. The women who joke about canceling your husband's vote: it doesn't have to always be a fight. Find someone show who votes to protect your rights and your dignity.

      "text": "I was out at a bar the other night with a few of my friends and while I was waiting in line for the restroom, a man came up, showing some interest and asking for my name. The interaction was quick because the restroom opened up and I went in. \n\nLater, I was sitting with my friends at a table and all of a sudden he showed up, stepping between my friend and I. Like very close, literally wedged himself between our chairs. \n\nHe was going on about if we had seen his friends. (I never saw him with anyone.) We were obviously confused and said no. Then he was going on about one of them being in trouble with the cops? He was just rambling. Then he left, not asking anyone else if they\u2019d seen his friends. \n\nAfter about fifteen minutes, we left to go to a small party. I saw him outside the bar and he was telling me to come over to him, but I just said I had to go with my friends to the party.\n\nWhen we got there, I made my way up to the bathroom and the minute after I peed, I felt like a rag doll. I could barely move. I could barely speak. I sat on the bathroom floor, fighting sleep. I felt like I couldn\u2019t breathe properly.\n\nWhat I drank was not enough to even get me to the point of being incapable of anything. It just felt different than being wasted. And trust, I know how my body feels when I\u2019m wasted. \n\nFrom here, my memory is fuzzy. What I remember was my friend getting me off of the floor. She led me down the stairs. I had extreme vertigo, not just drunk dizziness. I walked out with no shoes. I remember sitting on the side walk and not being able to move, literally at war with sleep. \n\nThank god my friend was DDing, other wise I would not have been able to walk home. I remember trying to make myself sick and barely getting anything out. I was panicked, my breathing was short. Then I woke up in bed. \n\nIt was nothing I had ever experienced. \n\nSo anyway, I am convinced my drink was spiked. I don\u2019t know what it could have been? If anyone knows what drug this sounds like, let me know. Thanks, and sorry that was long. <3",

Be assertive about filing a report and follow their instructions.

It won\u2019t be admissible like a hospital sample but it may answer some questions if the other urine is negative for it. \n\nMaybe there\u2019s a chance it can provide hints as to what you were drugged with. \n\nPlease submit a police report and consider letting the venue know. No venue wants a reputation of women getting drugged there.  You may be able to persuade them to pull the security footage for the night if you have a rough idea of when he barged in to sit with you.  (Assuming they are sympathetic.)\n\nYou could also search on social media for photos taken at that venue that day; geotagging might have you and that guy in the background of a shot.",

All of these \u201csmart\u201d men also are always the most clueless men I\u2019ve ever met. Just in my experience anything domestic is at a complete loss to them, very basic and simple tasks frustrate and confuse them. Using common sense to look for anything or to solve small problems is something they simply can\u2019t do. Its just little things that normal people have to do daily to survive and live functionally, things that are just base level common sense, and I find myself frustrated with every single \u201csmart\u201d man I\u2019ve dated because at one point or another I\u2019m screaming inside my head \u201chow can someone so smart be this stupid?!\u201d.

Mom was still trying to help take care of it/me. I had to sit her down and individually seize control of every single care process that she was doing. I made her explain everything. Not just what she was doing but all the why as well.  It took me about five years to feel self-sufficient to my own standards. idk if that means that knowing how to manage a household is equivalent to a BA or I'm just dyspraxic. \n\n I learned about cars and computers, plumbing, electrics, and other masculine arts before I was 10.

Visited some stuff, saw some old haunts (or what remained of them, holy cow!). Me and my partner stayed with my mom and her new husband, politics definitely came up. They\u2019re voting Trump, of course, but only for the economy they said. \n\nMom took us to an old wine bar I love, and while I was there I noticed some lgbt friendly stuff on the wall and told my partner that we were cool to express PDA and stuff in that space, she told me that there was no way a place like Houston wasn\u2019t progressive and I was maybe just referring back to how it was when I grew up there. I laughed and said \u201cno, Houston appears to very progressive for where it is, but overall you still need to watch yourself in most places\u201d. \n\nAfter the wine bar we went to a newer brewery, me an my mom got into a sorta heated conversation about politics (I asked her how she can say she has so many gay friends and vote for that guy, etc). While that was going on my partner went and asked a local queer presenting person about the safety climate for lgbt folks. She came back and said \u201coh.\u201d\n\nThe person my partner asked came around and handed her a list on the back of some receipt paper and said \u201chere are some places that are safe for y\u2019all to go\u201d. We thanked them and my mom was like \u201cI had no idea that was a thing, I thought it was safe here for you guys- that makes me want to cry\u201d. \n\nMy partner said \u201cyou all vote for your wallet- we vote for our actual safety\u201d. \n\nThank you stranger, I think you did more to open my mom\u2019s eyes about stuff than I ever could.

With one of them, we probably had a 2 hour on and off chat, and by the end she just said \"hey, thanks for letting me vent, really needed it\", by then my reaction was \"holy fuck, one more bad law and she's dead\".\n\nBut what that conversation made me realize is, how many men have not had a talk like this with their partner, who don't know what underlying conditions their partner or their families might have, that might impact pregnancies, birth, post-birth, etc. And for those who haven't, why? How many are completely unaware that their own mothers, sisters, cousins had severe pregnancy complications and were told \"80% chance of not surviving your next pregnancy, get on the pill now\"? And how many men are voting without realizing that this isn't exclusively about abortion by choice, but reproductive care in general (forget IVF for now, but things like ectopic pregnancies, PCOS, endometriosis, cervical cancer, etc)?",

There is no math formula for \"What is the perfect setting for the marginal tax rate?\"  If people disagree about that, that's not a horrible thing.\n\nOther things are not matters of opinion: gay people, brown people, women, trans people, they are all 100% human beings and they all have an absolute right to have their human rights respected.  If my partner is voting for someone who wants to ban gay marriage, he's not my partner anymore, end of story.",
         "Yes it would be. Anyone who voted for a treasonous rapist pedo as well as voting against my healthcare would not be my partner anymore.

         "I don't think it's as simple as a different candidate, as there are races where opposing candidates could be within an acceptable spectrum. \n\nBut politics are not a separate unimportant thing like toppings on a pizza. Its the culmination of your morals and ethics, and desires for your community. If you are diametrically opposed to your partner in these things, how can it NOT be a deal breaker?",
         "As much as I don\u2019t want to be that kind of person, it\u2019s a little hard for me to hang around someone who casts their vote towards the demonization of minorities. \u201cAgreeing to disagree\u201d refers to whether or not someone likes Tootsie rolls; there\u2019s no real way to compromise the lives and safety of innocent people.",
         "I'm not American so my take is different.\n\nFor me it would not be a deal breaker for my partner to vote for a different party/candidate in our riding, however, there are certain parties that voting for would be a deal breaker for me.\n\nThere are some things I am near single issue on, but others are not.

         "In this election, it would.",
         "Yes, and let me be clear that it absolutely would go both ways. If I agreed with absolutely everything Kamala Harris said about politics, but she made comments about sexually assaulting men, I wouldn\u2019t vote for her despite agreeing with 99% of her policy.

         "A different candidate in and of itself isn\u2019t an issue. But being a queer woman of trans experience, my partner voting for any candidate who is actively calling for my rights to be stripped would be a relationship ender.

         "i assume you\u2019re asking about for president. if so, yes. but generally it depends on the candidates and reasons for choosing them. for some of the more local offices my husband and i voted for different candidates, but we pretty much have the same goals we want accomplished, just interpreted which candidate would get that done differently. but if my husband for example actively wanted to vote for a candidate who wanted to eliminate my right to an abortion or who wanted to take away civil rights from my LGBTQ friends, that goes past \u201cpolitics\u201d and into making a decision that fucks with me and others\u2019 livelihood (luckily he and i are on the same page about that!)",
         "It depends on the election.\n\nOur current election cycle - absolutely. As far as I\u2019m concerned anyone who votes against Harris is ignorant, out of touch, and/or a bigot.",

         "Honestly it would depend on the outcome. I live in Canada so we can\u2019t outright vote for our PM, we have to vote by party. In some cases this is totally fine, but in others the MP for your chosen leadership party is a complete nonce and you\u2019d be better off with a different, better candidate. However, this means that you\u2019re indirectly supporting the leadership candidate you oppose. That sucks, but it\u2019s only happened to me once in all my voting years. \n\nIf I were American, and in the same boat as many women\u2026 I\u2019d never even marry someone if I wasn\u2019t 100% POSITIVE they were politically literate and aligned with me. There are a lot of differences that can be tolerated but being diametrically opposed politically in the current climate is not one of those things.",
         "That's a very easy and a very tough question all at once. In some elections it's probably fine. This one? The candidates are so vastly different that to vote differently from each other shows a severe break in ideology. \n\nIt's not even just simple party ideas, either.(As if they were simple. These days the parties are largely defined by the most extreme voices)I get it if someone doesn't like either candidate. There is plenty about both to not like, but for me it's a clear choice. I've got two little girls and a wife to think about. Which candidate is going to likely try to push through things that will hurt them or take rights from them? Which candidate has actively harmed or spoken absolutely degrading things about women?\n\nThere is no way I could vote for Trump and consider myself looking out for my family or their future.",
         "Not really. If we differ so much in politics that it would be a problem then I wouldn't be with them in the first place.",

Because in the U.S. the two major political parties different greatly in the values they espouse.  I could not be with a parter whose values are the opposite of my own.  That's just me.\n\nAt the local or even state level I could roll with at as this has happed for my 36 year partner and I.  He has close ties to one particular industry and has, on a rare occasion, voted for a party I won't vote for because he thought the candidate from that party was more in touch with issues related to his industry of concern.",

         "20+ years ago it could, MAYBE be justified as \u201cjust political differences\u201d but now we\u2019re fighting for our lives, liberty, and freedom so yeah idk how I could accept voting differently than my partner.",
         "Maybe. For sure yes if they're voting for a specific garbage can conservative party, which is usually just one party, but has spilt into one of two garbage can conservative parties in the past, so sometimes there's more than one. If someone was voting for a different party than me but for strategic voting reasons (blocking a garbage can conservative candidate who has a hope of winning the riding), then no, not a dealbreaker.\n\nI don't live in a two-party country, so it's a little more complicated.\n\nI honestly can't fathom how mixed-party romantic relationships work in the United States. While I was living there, I didn't even form *friendships* with anyone who considered themselves a Republican. It wasn't even a deliberate choice, it's just hard to have any respect for a person who believes what Republicans believe, and who is willing to excuse what Republicans excuse. It's way beyond the pale. If anything about that party seems appealing to someone, we really have nothing in common, and there's no conversation that won't end with me being horrified. So it goes way beyond being a dealbreaker. Americans supporting the Republican party don't rise to the level of \"will chat with you at a work party\", which is well below the \"would have a beer with you\" level, and is fathoms away from a romantic relationship.",
         "this election? I don\u2019t know. Maybe\n\nPrevious elections? no.",
         "Yes. Political beliefs are not just \u201cdifferences of opinion\u201d when you are part of a marginalized group, they are signals of fundamental differences in values and, often, morality / character. As a member of a marginalized group, if you\u2019re actively voting against my interests, right to exist, or even apathetic or  indifferent towards my rights, these things are huge dealbreakers to me.\n\nDifferences of opinion are for favorite ice cream flavor or which Fast & Furious franchise movie is the most bonkers, not whether I have the right to control my body or be free from your religion.",

The incumbent is like late 60s or early 70s and has held the position for like 25 years. They seem fine but I think a big problem in politics lately is that these old people just won\u2019t step aside so I\u2019m voting for their opponent who is like mid 30s. But my partner thinks they have done a good job and doesn\u2019t think they are \u201ctoo old\u201d so is voting for them to get another term. Fine, we can agree to disagree on that.",

He knows most of what Trump did and is doing. So I would feel betrayed if he voted for Trump after all of that. In 2016 I'd almost understand, but not now.\n\nHim voting for Trump even after knowing all of the shit he has done as president would tell me that he doesn't care if I lose my rights to my own body, even though he knows that I would die if I get pregnant and can't get an abortion. And that he doesn't care if children are separated from their parents and sent to a camp again.\n\nI even told him that if I found out that he voted for Trump either in 2020 or 2024 I'd get a divorce because of the implications surrounding that. He told me that he'd do the same if ***I*** voted for Trump. We laughed but we're both dead serious about it- neither one of us would ever date somebody who supports somebody like Trump.",

We can disagree respectfully and not destroy what we have. I know the things we disagree on does not make him a horrible human. We don\u2019t live in a state where if he voted opposite of me it wouldn\u2019t matter as he would be in the minority. I know he\u2019s still undecided though- the reason why is because we have a daughter and she matters more to him than anything so I suspect he will be voting in a way he never thought he might.",

If you\u2019re not voting for Trump or Harris, especially if you are in a swing state, for this election I still think you would be part of the problem if you\u2019re not doing what you can to make sure Trump isn\u2019t elected.

There's a reason barely 1% of abortions are officially the product of rape/incest, and it's because 99% of rapists are never convicted, and the ones that are convicted have a trial that goes on for so long that the baby will already be in kindergarten by the time some shitty judge gives him a 2 week sentence with community service. Pretty much every incest exception is a rape exception, which means all of these women have to spend a month being accused of lying by the police on top of living with their groomer of a father praying they aren't stabbed in the middle of the night. We have an inclusive policy specifically because the vast majority of these cases will ever make it to trial, much less be effective enough to block any pregnancies. It's the same reason we have no fault divorce, because otherwise many women will be stuck being abused and unable to prove it.

Now being allowed abortion keeps women AND their children in hostage situations of abuse.  Keeps women from leaving their abusers. Do they not realize that abusive men use this to control their families?????  Women not having this autonomy is the real sin!!!!",

And we've seen proof they're willing to firebomb offices and kill doctors. Nobody's started shooting DA's for prosecuting abortion cases.\n\nEdit: not that I'm saying to shoot anyone. Want to make a point? Respond to an anti-abortion rally by holding a pro-choice rally with posters of abused women in front of the local evangelical churches.

         "They say they'll allow exceptions, but they won't. If they were really concerned about that, the laws they made in those states since the fall of Roe would be very clear the specific conditions to be met to allow an abortion.

Exactly as you said, by the time any amount of recognition of the crime (or the exception) comes about...it becomes a moot point.  \"Sure, we allow abortions under the following exceptions....oops, too bad, kid is in first grade now...\"\n\nSo it not only allowed me to reel back the whole thought process...but even what the point of \"exceptions\" was.  Exceptions are bullshit.  Plain and simple.  They are what we tell ourselves to disguise our control over women.  \"No no, I'm a good guy.  I have a genuine concern for a woman's well-being.  I just want her to go through a personally-invasive, lengthy, and emotionally-taxing court battle with her abuser while she carries the developing fetus in her body.  Hmm...maybe...I have this wrong after all.\"\n\nThe point of having exceptions ignores the fundamental right of a woman to have agency over her own body.  It took me way too long to come to this.  Fortunately, I was not one of the vocal shouty ones, or someone in a position of power to influence these decisions.

I'm not fine with that, either. But, is that issue a valid reason to ban abortion? Hell no, because the core issue in this instance isn't abortion.

When you see reports of voter turn out, they show turnout as a percentage of *eligible age* adults. And in 2020 it was about 69% IIRC.    \n\n But not every eligible age adult can vote.  They get that data from the Census, but the census doesn't have a citizenship question (and it shouldn't, and we fought *really hard* against the former guy to make sure it wouldn't).  Non-citizens are about 3% of the population but are about a  5% skew on voting. Accounting for that effect, \"turnout\" would be 74%.  But wait!!\n\nThere's also felons (and ex-).  1%of the population is currently in prison and another 2% are of the ex- variety. Non of them are children - so the skew is about 4%. Bringing us up to 78%.\n\nThe biggest skew is people without a fixed address (at the time of the election). There are 12 months in a year and at any given time roughly the same number of people in the population are moving/changing addresses from month to month to month.  In addition to the homeless population.  In many states, you can't vote unless you are registered and you have to register at least 6 weeks before the election.  So anyone who moves in October is just shit out of luck that year. Estimates for the skew vary (I've read 3 different studies) from 5-8% of the population being \"transient\" - i.e. they moved and can't update their registration.  That brings the \"real turnout\" up to 86% - which is in line with every other OECD democracy (on average).  This varies widely across states, too.  Deep red and blue states with winner take all Electoral College rules are somewhat suppressed (around 82%, accounting for all sources of skew). While swing states typically show turnouts if 95% or better (once you account for skew).  This isn't all possible voters, but it's all the voters who could vote given the current \"rules\".\n\nThere are ways to fix all of the above - from not requiring an address to vote, to same-day registration, to better survey methods, to giving non-violent ex-felons back their rights. Guess which party *opposes* making it easier to vote (on bullshit 'security' grounds)?\n\nAnyway, at least feel better that Americans are not as apathetic as you think. We're just trapped in a Byzantine system with vested interests that oppose our voice. I know that isn't much better, but it is a bit......",

      "title": "Voters Are Poised to Reshape Abortion Access: Ten states are set to vote on ballot measures that could restore points of access in the South and elsewhere",
      "text": "https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/abortion-ballot-measures-election-2024-ed49d798\n\nArticle has charts and graphs if you can get by the paywall. \n\n> By Laura Kusisto and Jennifer Calfas\n>\n> Abortion-rights groups are on track to secure constitutional protections for the procedure in as many as 10 states on Tuesday, which would mark the most significant expansion of abortion access since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.\n\n> Polling data and fundraising totals have signaled strong support for most of the ballot initiatives, which appear in states with a range of political leanings. The measure that could have the biggest practical impact comes from Florida, which had been an island of abortion access in the South until a six-week ban went into effect in May of this year. But it is also the toughest test because supporters need to reach a 60% threshold for passage. \n\n> Voters in the battleground states of Arizona and Nevada also could decide to enshrine abortion rights there. Democrats are hoping the measures will help drive turnout and deliver a presidential victory for Kamala Harris. Arizona currently limits the procedure to 15 weeks of pregnancy, about two months earlier than what was allowed under Roe. Nevada already allows abortion up to 24 weeks, but supporters say a constitutional amendment would cement those rights.\n\n> Some 17 states now ban abortion after the earliest weeks of pregnancy. Most of the ballot measures would restore access through fetal viability, or about halfway through a typical pregnancy\u2014although opponents argue that the initiatives are so broadly worded that they would allow abortion throughout pregnancy. \n\n> \u201cWhat\u2019s very clear across all campaigns is that people don\u2019t want the government involved in private medical decisions. That\u2019s been this uniting force,\u201d said Chris Melody Fields Figueredo, executive director of the Ballot Initiative Strategy Center, a nonprofit that promotes progressive ballot measures.  \n\n> Abortion-rights supporters already have used ballot initiatives to override conservative legislatures, winning seven consecutive measures since Roe was overturned. In some of the states being contested now, groups favoring abortion access are fundraising at a clip that far outpaces their opponents, including in Florida where they have pulled in more than $100 million.\n\n> Polling on ballot measures has been more limited than in the presidential contest and other high-profile races. Antiabortion groups say they have seen some late fundraising momentum and remain optimistic they could pull out a win in some of these states, especially Florida.  \n\n> \u201cGoing into Election Day, we\u2019re seeing ballot-measure races tighten in a way we haven\u2019t in previous abortion-amendment fights,\u201d said Kelsey Pritchard, director of state public affairs for Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America. She said abortion-rights supporters were using exaggerated scare tactics to suggest that women can never get abortions, even in grave emergencies. \n\n> Florida is a crucial battleground because before the overturning of Roe, it had the third-highest number of abortions in the U.S. After Roe\u2019s downfall, Florida became one of the few access points in the South, and women often drove there overnight from places such as Louisiana and Texas. \n\n> That has changed since the six-week ban. The state has seen about 2,500 fewer in-person abortions each month, according to WeCount, an abortion-data project sponsored by the Society of Family Planning, which supports abortion rights. That has had ripple effects across the country, straining clinics in North Carolina and leading to a surge in demand for pills ordered online. \n\n> Abortion providers said women still sometimes travel to Florida from out of state only to find out they are too far along in pregnancy for the procedure. \u201cIt\u2019s horrible news to have to deliver over and over and over again,\u201d said Chelsea Daniels, a doctor at a Miami abortion clinic. \n\n> The antiabortion side has struggled to mount strong campaigns in states across the country, faced with donors pessimistic about the prospects for success. But in Florida it has an ally in Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has taken an unusually aggressive posture toward defeating the measure, calling it \u201cradical\u201d and \u201cvery, very extreme.\u201d A state public-health agency has run information on its website defending the ability of women facing medical emergencies to obtain abortions under current law, and the Florida health department recently threatened criminal charges against television stations for running an ad in support of the measure, saying it was misleading. \n\n> \u201cIf we win in Florida, it will be because of his leadership, and it serves as a model going forward,\u201d Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America President Marjorie Dannenfelser said of DeSantis. \n\n> Abortion opponents also believe they can win in South Dakota, where they have a fundraising edge. Nebraska, meanwhile, presents the most complicated picture, because the state ballot includes two competing measures, one to protect abortion rights and the other to outlaw the procedure in most cases after the first trimester. That has the potential to muddy the waters.\n\n> Abortion-rights groups are optimistic that they can pull out a win in Missouri, the first state to enforce its near-total ban after the Supreme Court overturned Roe. They have a fundraising advantage, having pulled in about $30 million compared with about $5 million for their opponents. \n\n> Rachel Sweet, the campaign manager for Missourians for Constitutional Freedom, also has led successful abortion-rights ballot-measure campaigns in Kansas, Kentucky and Ohio, using messaging focused on freedom, medical privacy and individual choice. \n\n> \u201cIn a state such as Missouri, you can\u2019t win with just Democrats, right? There aren\u2019t enough Democrats to do that,\u201d Sweet said.\n\n> The Missouri campaign has featured distinctly religious messaging.

      "text": "I'm a transgender woman who divorced my ex-wife about 10 years ago. Our two daughters decided that they wanted to live with me instead of their other parent. Since then, my ex-wife has been involved in a toxic relationship with a man with a lengthy DV history which included a prison sentence. I have in the past tried to convince her to leave him and her family has tried to do the same, but she wouldn't listen and kept going back to him.\n\nThis summer, my ex-wife and her boyfriend came to visit me and the girls. It worked fine for the first few days, but then they got into a verbal and physical altercation with each other. I got between them to prevent things from escalating, and I was very close to calling the cops. Things calmed down, but I ended up kicking them both out of my house as I didn't want to have that kind of behavior around my daughters. \n\nFast forward to last month. Everything exploded at their home a few states away. Another physical altercation that resulted in her finally pressing charges and taking out an emergency restraining order against him. I offered my home as a safe house to her while she's rebuilding her life and trying to figure out what next. \n\nWhile I want to help her, I'm apprehensive about the whole thing. It is the first time in almost a decade that I will cohabitate with my ex-wife and I'm uncertain how that dynamic will play out. We divorced because I didn't live up to her expectations of a \"husband\" and I couldn't handle her hot temper.\n\nHowever, I am most worried about her now ex-boyfriend. He is a hot-tempered man with an extensive DV history spanning decades. He has been to my home so he knows where we live and that she most likely will be staying with us.\n\nAny advice on possible precautions that I can take and how to navigate this issue? I'm feeling overwhelmed right now.",

         "This is such a nightmare scenario to be in.\u00a0\n\n\nLook, I'm gonna be blunt here. I know your hope is that your ex is leaving this guy for good and that he's going to leave her (and you, and your children) alone, but I wouldn't put hang my children's safety on that hook if I were you.\u00a0\n\n\nThere's a high chance your ex will go back to him, and a high chance he will come make trouble at your house whether she does or doesn't. The fact that you're trans can't be taken out of the equation either; I'm sure you are well aware that threats and violence against trans people aren't taken as seriously as those against cis people. :(\n\n\nAs cold as it sounds, I really don't think its safe for you or your kids to have her stay there while that man isn't behind bars. It would be safer (and perhaps even cheaper) in the long run to find her a studio apartment or room for rent and cover some of her rent, if you can swing it. That may hurt her chances of 'getting out', but you have to put your kids and yourself first. Vengeful violent ex boyfriends is how people end up on the news.",
         "Or can't you help her move into s shared house or somewhere cheaper that both of u can afford?\nHaving your girls (and youself) at home with her might get you guys in danger if she still keeps in touch with that man or letting him know where she stays.",
         "Yeah, that's a very risky situation. \n\nThe first thing I'd do is install cameras all around the house. Make sure your doors and windows are secure and stay locked at all times. If your ex can file for a DV protection order, she should do so. It will increase the chances of the cops taking you seriously if you have to call them. \n\nGetting your ex into therapy should be a priority. Nobody comes out of an abusive relationship mentally healthy, and it sounds like she had major issues before that. Set clear boundaries about what kind of behavior is allowed around your children, and speak to her about any concerning behavior as quickly as possible.",
         "Get bear spray. Get a big dog. Put motion sensor lights and cameras around the property.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nRemember when you call the cops they are 15 minutes to 2 hours or more away.\u00a0 They legally have no obligation to protect you.\n\n\n\n\nThis last bit is only if you feel up to it. Me i would if you are in a country and state that allows it get a handgun learn to use it and get carry permit.\u00a0",
         "This! \u00a0Also, immediately call police any and every time he is seen. Don\u2019t hesitate and wait until he does something \u201cwrong\u201d again. Make sure he know it will happen instantaneously the very moment he is seen each and every time.\u00a0",
         "The other options would be her brother or her parents, but her boyfriend have to been to their homes too. They have broken up several times before, but she ended up going back to him each time. I'm hoping that staying with us she can finally break that toxic cycle and rebuild her self-esteem and independence. She's the mother of my children and I want her to be well and healthy for my daughters' sake. Moving isn't an option. It took me years to rebuild my life and get this beautiful home I have. I'm also tied down with work and graduate studies (seminary).",

Wade gone, Trump could appoint a new right-wing head of the FDA that rescinds the 2000 authorization of Mifepristone. He could then, or separately, direct his DOJ to enforce the 1873 Comstock Act, an anti-obscenity law still on the books that criminalizes sending any abortion-related materials through the mail or a common carrier. Roe made it unenforceable, but with Roe overturned the Comstock Act is back in play. Joe Biden has been choosing not to enforce it, but all Trump has to do is tell his DOJ to do so.\n\nWith these two actions, and without a single new law, Trump could ban medication abortion nationwide and prevent any materials used in surgical abortions from being sent anywhere, regardless of state law.

Up here in the \"liberal\" Pacific Northwest, around 30% of hospitals have some kind of Catholic affiliation....and we're not even done here, because when some private corporation buys out a Catholic-run hospital, a common clause of the business agreement is that they are required to keep the Catholic morality standards.\n\nThis is one more part of the existential threat to freedom posed by the [Christian Taliban.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1f7r443/what_is_the_biggest_threat_facing_america/ll9dedw/) The publicly-stated goal of Christian dominionists is to impose a real-world Republic of Gilead on us all, whether we like it or not.

Turns out that their definition of \"abortion\" can be so broad that some life-saving procedures in case of a serious miscarriage come too close to their definition of abortion. In New York City, Stewart suffered a miscarriage, and was rushed to a Catholic-run hospital (because it was the closest). Because the procedure needed to save her life involved removing the fetus, they just let her lie there and bleed instead.

Dobbs said that a right to medical privacy doesn't exist and is not granted by the US Constitution.  The first thing states did was use the ruling to go after abortion because states can now inspect medical records and make medical decisions on behalf of individuals.

         ">Elsewhere, he's been on recording stating that a six week abortion limit, as was proposed in Florida, is too short.\n\nBut he explicitly voted to keep the 6 week limit when the measure was on the Florida ballot.\n\nIn 2016 Trump said that women should be prosecuted for having an abortion:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhMrG6WU4sE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhMrG6WU4sE)  He eventually backtracked then settled on, \"Well, the states would be the ones to decide.\"\n\nIn May, Trump said during an interview with a Pittsburgh television station that he was\u00a0[open to supporting regulations on contraception](https://apnews.com/article/trump-contraception-birth-control-abortion-2024-8f73bb1b3a5864b24157f15eb272a3e6)\u00a0and that his campaign would release a policy on the issue \u201cvery shortly.\u201d He later said his comments were misinterpreted.\n\nDonald Trump\u00a0suggested in a news conference Thursday, 8 August, 2024 that he is open to curbing access to\u00a0abortion\u00a0pills through federal regulations.\n\nTrump has repeatedly bragged about getting Roe v. Wade overturned so abortion could be banned then, when it proved unpopular, backtracked and said that he'd only \"turned it back to the states.\"  He rubber stamps Federalist Judges to federal judgeships and the Supreme Court.  The Federal Society is anti-abortion.  He doesn't need to be explicitly anti-abortion - he can just appoint a freight ton of judges to do it for him.\n\nTrump has suggested at times that he'd sign a federal abortion ban at the 15 week mark.  Many women don't find out until the 20 week mark if a fetus has severe health issues.  Even if he signed a bill with the 15 week limit, that only means that no state would be able to allow abortions past the 15 week limit.  States that banned abortions wouldn't be required to allow abortions up to 15 weeks.\n\nRecently Vance is claiming he never wanted a national abortion ban but two years ago he said he wanted abortion to be illegal nationally:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oR\\_nD-pOWvA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oR_nD-pOWvA)  Vance has repeatedly said things like people who don't have kids are mentally unstable and that people without kids don't have any stake in the country's future and should have less say in government than those who have kids.  Trump isn't exactly stable mentally or physically.  If Trump wins, I expect Vance and Co. will either do \"Weekend at Bernie's\" with Trump or flat out 25A him in a few months after the inauguration.  \n\nVance is very pro-Project 2025 which calls for abotion to be eliminated.  Even if you think Trump will make it through another entire term, Trump claims he doesn't back Project 2025 but a large number of senior official from his first administration worked on Project 2025 and Trump has bragged about how much of the Heritage Foundation's plans he's put into practice.",

I said that I think that it can be difficult to have a close relationship when you have very different core values.  \n\nMy sister said that I am saying that I don't want a relationship w/someone who has different values and beliefs and this is selfish and conditional love.  That I don't want her in my life b/c she does not believe the same things.  She says I am abandoning her and rejecting her.

Nor, do I forgive her for supporting a man who tried to overthrow our government.

My best guess is in 2005 the Indiana state gov, while completely controlled by Republicans passed a slew of legislation tweaking and changing the laws and regs surrounding elections. Since then Indiana has become progressively more restrictive, voter suppression is more common (voter turnout is LOW/voter registration is low), and their electoral districts are more heavily gerrymandered than 95% of the nation.\n[2005 Indiana Electoral Legislation Summary](https://www.in.gov/sos/elections/files/2005-Legislation-SummaryFinal.pdf)",

I\u2019m so exhausted and mentally drained from always being the bigger person, letting things go, and never talking to or treating people the way they do to me \n\nFor example\u2026just in the last 5 days-\n\nMy cousin is bringing her and her brothers dogs over to my house for dinner tonight. I told her I\u2019d rather she not because my dog is 14 and old and anxious. He ran away yesterday when the dogs were over and the times before, he gets super uncomfortable. She told me she doesn\u2019t care and he (my dog) can chill outside or in his cage\n\nOne of my friends and I rented a cabin with our friend group at a festival. We all got separated when she had her boyfriend and 7 of his friends show up. My other friend and I walked home alone in the cold, rain while she and her bf saw us while driving, waved and kept driving back to the cabin. Then I woke up in the morning and she and him were sleeping below me in the bunk bed and they didn\u2019t tell me. Then I went downstairs and his 5 friends were sleeping in the tiny living room. They didn\u2019t pay or anything and she didn\u2019t ask us of these strangers and MEN can stay while she made a huge deal about one girl not paying bc it\u2019s unfair \n\nMy aunt comments on all of my girl cousins posts on Facebook except mine and it\u2019s very hurtful and my mom says to always just be the bigger person. They\u2019ll get what\u2019s coming to them for being hurtful and mean but I\u2019m so sick of letting it go and cutting everyone some slack. \n\nMy cousin who\u2019s like my sister and I got into a fight today over text bc our uncle asked if I was voting. I said of course. He asked if my cousin, we\u2019ll call her Nicole was voting. I said not sure since she\u2019s at college and away from home. He then texted her, teasing her to go and vote. She then texts me she has so much going on, keep her name out of my mouth, she\u2019s very stressed, it\u2019s no one\u2019s business whether she votes or not, and she has too much going on to vote \n\nI just feel so lost right now. I feel like I\u2019m so angry at everyone and everything. I try my best to organize things, make plans, and do fun stuff. Then my friends never follow through, say they\u2019d rather stay home, they ignore me or don\u2019t answer. I\u2019m really struggling with work right now too with my boss telling me I need to be a leader and strive for success when I\u2019m the first one in the office. I come in every day a half hour early, I\u2019m the last to leave. I\u2019m constantly creating fun and creative things for my job and our company. I just don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me and why everything I\u2019m doing is crumbling. I set boundaries and everyone gets mad. When I\u2019m the one who always lets it slide. I always let it go. And now I\u2019m not and now it seems like everyone hates me",

         "You might like the book \"Where to Draw the Line: How to Set Healthy Boundaries Every Day.\" I read it and feel more comfortable and confident when saying what I will and won't do, and it upsets me less people when people are unhappy with me.",
         "Then stop. \n\n> I set boundaries and everyone gets mad. \n\nSo they get mad. So what? Not your problem. If someone is upset you set a boundary that's all the confirmation you need it was absolutely necessary to set.",
         "I used to be one too. When people fail you too many times or you get upset too often, you will eventually slow down on pleasing people. I tried to always remind myself that making people happy also making myself happy. There are people that u give 5 times and they don't even return once, then I would stop. My advice though. Hope it helps. Take care.",
         "I learned how to do this far too late. The longer you leave it the worse it gets. And yes people will get angry & hate on you and you will get backlash. And then you\u2019ll look at who they truly are and wonder why you were wasting your time & energy on them in the first place. Good luck.",
         "Practice. Start small. Keep going. \n\nThe trick is you don't need to practice making people upset. People are going to be upset and you can't control that. It's not your responsibility or problem. \n\nYou are practicing being ok with other people being upset. The practice is to not immediately do something to try to fix it or make it better. \n\nAnother thing to think or is to compare how you treat yourself versus other people. A lot of people pleasers don't prioritize themselves.  Sometimes by a lot. Would you let anyone treat someone else the way you treat yourself? Or would you step in and try to please them? You can focus the aim of your people pleasing back at yourself. It's ok to do that.",
         "I'm really sorry. This is a super hard place to be in and the worst part of making positive change. Once people learn they can walk all over you, they come to expect it and they invite their friends to join. The minute you start to enforce reasonable boundaries, you are being difficult and disrupting their lives. There really is no way out but through. People who care about you will care about your boundaries and adjust. People who don't and who are only there because they are getting something out of you won't...and all you can do is watch them burn that bridge down. That was a hard one for me. \n\nI just want to reassure you that this isn't an overnight thing and just because it's still hard to do, doesn't mean you're failing at it. Learning how to set boundaries with other people is a skill. So is learning to set emotional boundaries with yourself to stop all of those feelings and learned negative core beliefs from dominating your thoughts. \n\nLike, you don't become a people pleaser by choice. It's a learned response. It's a protection mechanism. It's really shitty and has a high cost, but it did its job. You can't just drop a shield like that without building up something better in its place, which is what you are working on doing right now. And when you build up those new boundaries based on your own values and what works for you, and not what other people demand, they become easier to hold onto. People who can't respect that authentic you exit your life and new people who not only can, but want to, enter.",

Now I believe that I deserve the same voice and respect as everyone else. Before, I didn\u2019t. And, I was content to let people walk all over me because that\u2019s what I thought I deserved. \n\nIf someone crosses my boundaries now, I push back because I know I deserve better. It\u2019s hard and it\u2019s scary and it can feel like you\u2019re almost leaving your old self behind. But, it feels like an enormous weight off my shoulders to not have to set myself on fire to keep others warm anymore.",

These values, whether intentionally or not, often end up re-centering men and reinforcing narratives that sidestep real issues women face. Terms like \"misandry\" & \"man hate\" are tossed around, usually in ways that ignore the actual dynamics of power, oppression, and social history. It feels too similar to claims of \"reverse racism,\" which ultimately serve to distract from real discussions about power and inequality.\n\nThe entire social media landscape, including Reddit, plays a big role in upholding this status quo. Platforms that are supposedly also for women still see us walking on eggshells, dodging around arbitrary rules that seem to cater more to male comfort than to genuinely elevating women\u2019s voices. This is why I\u2019m considering creating a truly women-centered space where cishet men, and women who uncritically align with right-wing or neoliberal values, wouldn\u2019t dominate or dilute the conversation or experiences on a platform like Discord. \n\nThis wouldn\u2019t be an exclusionary space, but it would prioritize voices that bring a socially and politically aware, leftist perspective (class concious, anti capitalist and anti Western imperial values, Covid concious, aware about ableism, anti racism, intersectionality and so on). \nCishet men and people in general are welcome to join if they\u2019ve done the work or want to do the work to understand these issues and can respectfully engage with the community\u2019s goals..\n\nThis would take sustained effort and commitment, it\u2019s not as easy as simply endless engaging on Reddit or other mainstream platforms that people love to go back to, out of convenience. If there\u2019s enough interest, I\u2019d love to discuss this further and see if we can build something worthwhile together, even if it starts out really small.

The violence is never addressed because they are going to be the rapists.... err \"falsely accused\", not the rape victims! That's why every post ever that talks about rape has \"Not all Men\" or \"What about men?\" They don't want to talk about the fact most rapists will never get prosecuted nor will they see a day in jail.

Wages are going down, no one can afford property or kids, constant violence that has a million warnings that go ignored. Because men see themselves as the Great Conqueror, not the victim.

When it comes to posting content, I\u2019d expect it\u2019s actually domain specific.

         "Not the OC, but I'm waiting for a few reasons: \n\n1) Where I live: Early voting lines are a minimum of 1 hour, while on the day itself a very long wait would be 10 minutes. Early voting is a mile walk away, on the day it's under 5 minutes of walking to get to my polling place. So it's the difference of minimum of 1.5 hours vs a total of 20 minutes of my time only if things move very slowly. \n\n2) The nearest mailbox is further away than my polling place, so mail-in has no advantage plus trusting the USPS right now is not high on my list. The nearest drop box is at the early voting location, so again, 2 miles round trip instead of under a mile. \n\n3) I love the ritual of it on the day. I've been \"voting\" since I was 3 years old in a booth on the day, it reminds me of my parents who are gone and were both politically obsessed. Then I get a drink and toast to my right to vote. It's a lovely tradition every year!",
         "If they\u2019re in PA, it doesn\u2019t matter if you wait until Election Day to vote: election workers are not allowed to pre-count ballots received by mail or in ballot boxes. They ALL get counted on Election Day, after the polls close. The ones people mail in, or drop in ballot boxes, are doled out to their respective local precincts along with all the other Election Day supplies, and we hold them until after all the voters are gone and we\u2019ve closed. And then we start counting them all.",
         "Not the person you asked, but my husband and I always vote in-person because we live in PA, where the Rs running the legislature won\u2019t let election workers even *start* to count mail-in ballots until the polls close at 8pm on Tuesday. We knew that it was part of the fake elector scheme back in 2020. Since it was mostly Rs voting in person, those tallies were reported by the end of the night, so it seemed like trump was ahead. But it took *days* to count all the mail-ins, and when President Biden pulled ahead and won, they said it was because illegal ballots were being snuck in in the middle of the night.\n\nMy family and friends are aware that they will always use this to sow doubt and confusion into our state\u2019s results, so we vote in person whenever possible.",

(Unfortunately got scheduled to work for 11 of the 13 hours polls are open *and* currently live in a different county than where I'm registered so we're talking like an hour+ journey from home to polling place to work and that's not even counting waiting in line. Which, for the record, if I had no other choice I'd do it in a heartbeat but man I am not a morning person. So thankfully I easily got my mail-in and was able to drop it off 3 days ago.)",

         "You shouldn't feel guilty. It's been emphasized because a certain percentage of people who wait until election day will end up not being able to vote due to unforeseen circumstances. It's inevitable. Early voting has been encouraged because it's a close race and everyone wants to make sure that all voters get a chance to cast their vote. There's nothing wrong with waiting; there's just always a chance something will happen that will keep you from voting (traffic, flat tire, work, something with the kids, etc.)",

I mean still worried about MI but less than my worry about PA. I don't know how we will all adjust and get through if fascism wins. As my grad and undergrad years were spent studying 1920s-1930s Germany, the echoes of history are ringing loudly in my ears and I fear for our very lives if he wins ... those of us who speak out and don't kow tow to them, those who are not lily white, those who are not CIS-gendered, those who are not rich, etc. It's more than just abortion for me that causes a pit of dread in my stomach.

Maybe Batman, Superman, Thor, Ironman, The Hulk etc. Google-Marvel figurines or DC comic figurines and make sure they are age appropriate by cross checking the movie that came out and it's not NC17 for those figures."

      "text": "An abortion ban can happen federally without being signed in. \n\nTwo things are extremely likely to happen under a Trump presidency, and this is realistic, because it's already in progress judicially at state and state government levels. The Trump admin will use the C omstock a ct to ban the mailing of m ifepriston e in the United States but also from international locations; it would be illegal and seized. My state of Tennessee has been exploring avenues to ban m ifepriston e being sent in the mail, so this is a Republican initiative. \n\nTrump has talked about who he will appoint and he has plans to appoint someone that not only guts the F D A, but that could successfully make m ifepriston e illegal to be used for abortions. This would effectively make medical abortion unobtainable in every state. \n\nBetween these two routes, abortion will basically be illegal federally - without ever having had to sign a bill. So even though Trump said he wouldn't sign a bill, that doesn't matter and was likely never the goal.\n\nNo state will be safe and even if a state has abortion constitutionally enshrined, if m ifepriston e is illegal to be mailed or to be used for abortion, medical abortion will not be obtainable anywhere, only surgical abortion, which severely limits protected states to offer the procedure in a timely manner. This means women who should have had access to an abortion in the first trimester won't have it because of wait times at the very small amount of clinics that even still offer abortion.\n\nThis isn't even taking into consideration miscarriage care if fetal tissue is retained and there's no access to m ifepriston e. If abortion is not accessible, a retained miscarriage would result in sepsis. Sepsis leads to severe injury and death.\n\nI'm not fear mongering, I'm telling you in stark reality what the future could look like. ",

      "text": "Marked NSFW as a small TW. \n\nI\u2019m a person with a lot of anxiety at baseline. I\u2019ve gone through a lot of changes the past year physically, and I feel like I can\u2019t leave the house without being gawked at or hit on and it\u2019s making it harder for me to go out in public. I also have a little bit of trauma from an incident that happened in a public setting where someone watched me use the restroom and then followed me, and I\u2019ve been trying to deal with it in part by going out in places that remind me of that place. Over the past weekend by just going to restaurants, stores, and existing with my partner I\u2019ve been approached and hit on, hit on by multiple drunks, unapologetically stared down by someone, asked to be taken to a back room by an employee of somewhere I went, and hit on and then cold shouldered by a bar tender when I had a friend show up. The vast majority of this has been with or in front of my partner. I feel like I can\u2019t leave my house without something happening and I want to crawl in a hole. Arguably one of the worst parts of this is that when I complain or try to vent to friends about it, they shrug it off like I\u2019m bragging. But I\u2019m not, I feel like I\u2019m at my wits end and I\u2019m becoming more and more reluctant of just leaving the house.  ",

         "This is gonna be easier said than done, but it sounds like, despite everything that people have tried to do, you are still here, you are fine, and none of it ended up directly hurting you. Try to appreciate that for a moment. And try to specifically appreciate your own part in this. \u00a0\n\nThe reality is that other people will be pieces of shit. Not always, not everywhere to the same extend but you can\u2019t necessarily avoid sex pests. But what you can do is build up functional mechanisms of protecting yourself from them. And it sounds like you are already doing a great job at that. Your sense of security has to come from your confidence in your own ability to deal with a threatening situation. \u00a0\n\nYou may still be able to develop your current methods further. And you should. Improving your defensive strategies is what keeps you safe, after all. But being safe does not necessarily equate to feeling safe. That is a separate and equally important effort of allowing yourself to be proud of the progress you have already made. \u00a0\n\nOne more thing though: exposure therapy can be very effective. But it works by teaching your brain that you can do a thing and nothing bad happens and you are safe. But this doesn\u2019t work if you arent safe, or don\u2019t feel safe. Then all you do is teach your brain that being scared was the right reaction. It can be a great idea to put yourself in controlled and safe situations that might remind you of your trauma. But if the situation is not safe or controlled, you are just re-traumatising yourself.\u00a0",
         "Your experience is valid, and wildly inappropriate... I would STRONGLY recommend working with a therapist to help you develop responses to tell people to fuck off (politely and in ways that don't risk your safety (and isn't it pitiful that I even have to say that)).. But predators recognize insecurity, and working on your sense of security in yourself will make a bigger difference than you think (won't stop all of them, but will definitely make more of them back off, and give you the strength to respond to the ones that it doesn't).\n\n  \nI am so so so sorry you are going through this!!!",
         "I would make a big deal out of it for every one of these assholes. \n\nI would shut them down as hard as possible and shame them about their behavior. As long as there are people in public, with you that will back you up, and it's safe (as safe as it can be anyway). Ask them what they would do if a guy that said that stuff to their mom, sister, or daughter? \n\nDoing this would only partially be for them. A big part of it would be for you. \n\nIf you confront them, even minimally at first, you will build up the ability to do it more. If you confront them you will feel better than you did and you'll notice people backing you up. Which will make you feel better about the world and people in general. \n\nThese assholes won't change unless they are made to. They need pressure from someone somewhere. And it shouldn't have to be you. It should have to be anyone. But it ends up being everyone. We all need call out unacceptable behavior. \n\nI am sorry that the world is like this. I can tell you absolutely and unequivocally, that it's not your fault. You did nothing wrong. There is nothing wrong with how you are or what you look like. They are the problem. And you are better than them.",

         "Here's more cheery news: even in states where abortions are still legal, Catholic-run hospitals are a thing, and they are run on *seriously* conservative anti-abortion guidelines that are at least the equal of the reddest anti-abortion states. So don't go to a Catholic-run hospital? Yeah, if you suddenly start bleeding out from a serious miscarriage, you don't really have time to shop around. The procedures needed to save your life might skim too closely to their definition of \"abortion.\"\n\nThere are Catholic hospitals all over the country. Up here in the \"liberal\" Pacific Northwest, around 30% of hospitals have some kind of Catholic affiliation....and we're not even done here, because when some private corporation buys out a Catholic-run hospital, a common clause of the business agreement is that they are required to keep the Catholic morality standards.\n\nThis is one more part of the existential threat to freedom posed by the [Christian Taliban.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1f7r443/what_is_the_biggest_threat_facing_america/ll9dedw/) The publicly-stated goal of Christian dominionists is to impose a real-world Republic of Gilead on us all, whether we like it or not. The Supreme Court now has a majority of dominionists on it, and they will be demolishing hard-won civil rights for a decade or more.\n\nIf you wanted to read just one book about them, I'd recommend The Power Worshipers by Katherine Stewart. It's well-researched, and delves deeply into the history of the dominionists in America. Stewart also has a *personal* stake in the current practice of states making abortion illegal. Turns out that their definition of \"abortion\" can be so broad that some life-saving procedures in case of a serious miscarriage come too close to their definition of abortion. In New York City, Stewart suffered a miscarriage, and was rushed to a Catholic-run hospital (because it was the closest). Because the procedure needed to save her life involved removing the fetus, they just let her lie there and bleed instead. When she had lost about 40% of her blood and was hovering near death, they finally deigned to step in and save her life.",
