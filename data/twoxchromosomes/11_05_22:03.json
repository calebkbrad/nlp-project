This amendment does not change the Legislature's constitutional authority to require notification to a parent or guardian before a minor has an abortion.\n\n*The proposed amendment would result in significantly more abortions and fewer live births per year in Florida.  The increase in abortions could be even greater if the amendment invalidates laws requiring parental consent before minors undergo abortions and those ensuring only licensed physicians perform abortions.  There is also uncertainty about whether the amendment will require the state to subsidize abortions with public funds.  Litigation to resolve those and other uncertainties will result in additional costs to the state budget.  An increase in abortions may negatively affect the growth of the state budget.  An increase in abortions may negatively affect the growth of state and local revenues over time.  Because the fiscal impact of increased abortions on state and local revenues and costs cannot be estimated with precision, the total impact of the proposed amendment is indeterminate.*  **THE FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THIS AMEMENDMENT CANNOT BE DETERMINED DUE TO AMBIGUITIES AND UNCERTAINTIES SURROUNDING THE AMENDMENT'S IMPACT.\"** The bolded and capitalized words are theirs; italics are mine.\n\n  \nThis was not written on a prolife pamphlet, it wasn't a Republican anti-abortion ad.  It was on the goddamn *voting ballot.*  A supposed nonpartisan document that is supposed to provide unbiased information about an amendment.

Atlanta\u2019s county has almost 2 million people, and its surrounding counties (which are also pretty blue) have close to or above a million each themselves. \n\nIt\u2019s not even close to over in Georgia. It\u2019s just that the small counties that have a lower population count their votes quicker than the big counties with huge populations. It\u2019s called the red mirage and it\u2019s to be expected.",

And insurance rates skyrocketing. \n\nHonestly. I don\u2019t see how any educated person can imagine that it\u2019s more affordable to stay in Florida than it is to move. \n\nI guess it boils down to how much they care about their daughters.",
         "Also, some of the swing states have rules deliberately designed to delay vote counting. In particular, requiring that absentee ballots not be counted until after the in-person ballots...which also has the side effect of causing blue votes to trickle in after election day while red votes all show up the first day.\n\nWhich, of course, helps their congress critters claim that they're \"creating fake votes to steal the election\".",
         "Also GA hasn't been called yet. She's leading in PA and WI so that's a good sign.",
         "I\u2019m really hoping that it\u2019s a mirage and not true, because if it\u2019s true I\u2019m gobsmacked that in 4 years people in Georgia forgot about what almost happened last time",

Here\u2019s why:\n\n1.\t\u2060Global Impact: U.S. decisions on climate change, international trade, and global security affect everyone. Your vote influences policies that ripple far beyond American borders.\n2.\t\u2060Stand Up for Democratic Values: Voting is a powerful way to shape and protect democracy. In a world facing challenges to freedom and rights, every voice for fair representation matters.\n3.\t\u2060Address Shared Issues: From healthcare and education to climate action, many of the issues at stake in the U.S. elections are universal. Your vote impacts progress on these critical fronts.\n\nSo if you\u2019re eligible, please vote today! You\u2019re not only choosing leaders for the U.S.; you\u2019re helping shape a world many of us believe in and support. Make your voice heard\u2014today counts!",

I've been able to have some good conversations about getting egnaged and managing anxiety. And I get it, I think Harris likely will win but I'm a nervous goddamn wreck right now. I'm also a statistician, so I've had months of people wanting me to reassure them about the polls and explain things to them, so I've been doing a lot of trying to calm other people's anxieties which doesn't really help my own.",

I was a registered republican, refused to vote Trump, but couldn't bring myself to vote for Hillary. That is the last time I will ever make that mistake. Today, I proudly voted blue all the way down the ballot.",

Obama wasn't terrible, but he had nowhere near Hillary's experience.  And at this point, I just want a President who is competent, coherent, and not a traitor.  Is that too much to ask?",

         "Just to add to this, voting is only the first step! I really, really hope all of us take this passion and apply it to our political participation beyond just elections. The women before us fought for so much more than voting, they fought for our voices and participation in the political process as a whole. Don't turn your nose up at jury duty.

         "Thanks for doing it the first time, I wish I had. Maybe this is Hillary\u2019s legacy, to prime us for this moment. I\u2019m not a praying woman, but I\u2019m doing whatever the spiritual equivalent is today. I hope it sticks too.",
         "I would be able to say this too had I been old enough to vote 8 years ago\u2026 unfortunately I was only 14 back then. But at least I do get to say I\u2019ve voted for a woman once, and hopefully that number grows in the future :)",

         "It definitely is as a learning moment. I\u2019ll never sit out an election again. I\u2019m hoping we have a record turnout today and that the American people exercise their right to vote. I hope we preserve that right today.",

         "I think it\u2019s okay to be ashamed. If enough people who had the mindset I had, just gone out and voted, we may have a completely different situation today. Perhaps we would barely know anything of Donald Trump and his daily musings if we had shut this shit down in 2016. I just hope enough people have realized their mistake, and are planning to do differently this time.",
         "Major kudos to you for putting yourself through major inconvenience to exercise your right and to make your voice heard. Many people would consider rain too much a burden to vote. Thank you!",

I'm concerned that economically aspirational Latin men (predominantly) and women to a lesser extent may be taken in by some of his rhetoric and may brush off the racism. I wouldn't be surprised if some younger black men were taken in for the same reason. I just feel so frustrated that people are being taken in by his non-existent economic plans at the cost of being seen as basically subhuman. That's insanely depressing, though I suppose not necessarily a new thing. His rhetoric has been so fucking nasty, though.\n\nI don't know if white women are finally coming to their senses, but preliminary reporting I've seen on this didn't reflect that to the extent that some sources reflected prior to now. I really hope that turns around and that these are just indications that come from incomplete data. No idea about the military/veteran component, as well. That's interesting to consider",

And this also doesn't just apply to abortions, workers rights, your right to not be fucked with by the police, healthcare, and so many other rights have been chipped away at while expanding the privileges of the already privileged. Just because there isn't some big sweeping drastic change currently on the block doesn't mean there isn't something important that has to be fought over. The Patriot act still exists, the ACA will be fought over, as well as Medicare and Medicaid, Social Security is always on the line.

It's so frustrating watching people fall for this crap. I vote both in the US and in Australia and you see the same utter grifting to various degrees when it comes to men like this who are economically out of touch and uninformed, but have so much to say about how great they'll be for everyone. People inexplicably lap it up\n\nYeah, I totally agree. It's such a crazy time in terms of voting implications. The other thing's just the rage one feels when a vote for Trump \"on economic grounds\" implicates voters in his mass deportation plan - something that is not only obviously inhumane and convoluted, but which is obviously far from free-of-cost to arrange and would cut, what, 10 million extremely essential workers from the US job market?

Let\u2019s be honest, too, about how much of our economy depends upon immigrants. Farmers, would you like to have a word?\n\nAnd then on top of that he wants to put tariffs on all of our goods, so everything is going to become exorbitantly expensive and it falls on the consumer. \n\nI mean??????!!!??",

He tells me this story and then starts saying \u201cI mean, they\u2019re just sending these people in from everywhere, these people are animals.\u201d So I ask if the murderer is as an immigrant, is that why he\u2019s tying immigration to this story?

Because for a great many of them, despite all the fuss and bother and appearances, their religion is simply not important. Their religious commitment, like the person they think they are, does not exist in significant ways. When Donald Trump came along, resplendent in moral shortcomings but promising the moon, evangelicals had little difficulty setting aside their supposed beliefs and supporting him. In fact, this was their S.O.P. They had been setting those beliefs aside 167 hours a week for most of their lives.

Brigid, exercising the most potent strength of her ineffable faith, blessed her, causing the child to disappear, without coming to birth, and without pain. She faithfully returned the woman to health and to penance\"\n\n[Ciar\u00e1n of Saigir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciar%C3%A1n_of_Saigir#cite_note-15)\n\n>He is reputed in the Lives as having miraculously performed abortion in a raped nun called Bruinnech.\n\nThe wikipedia page also has a response from a more modern Catholic on this, which amusingly is basically \"yo we just make all this Saint stuff up it doesn't mean anything\".\n\n[\u00c1ed mac Bricc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%81ed_mac_Bricc)\n\n>On one occasion, when he perceived that the girl serving him was pregnant he fled from the building both to avoid the pollution and to shame her. She confessed her sins and did penance. \u00c1ed was not one to leave someone under his care in a difficult situation; he blessed her womb and the baby disappeared as if it had never been there.\n\nSo this Saint will emotionally abuse you a bit first, but then he will provide miracle healthcare.\n\n[Cainnech of Aghoboe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cainnech_of_Aghaboe) His wikipedia page doesn't mention his holy abortion, but the first source has this story.\n\n>A certain nun living in Cainnech of Aghaboe\u2019s neighborhood secretly committed fornication. In time, her womb began to grow with the child conceived. She asked Saint Cainnech to bless her belly, pretending that it was swollen by some ailment or pain. When he blessed her, the infant in her womb vanished, not appearing.\n\nNote that every one of these Saints is Irish, and if you google it's these four Saints that you will find, in many different places. I'm not sure if that's because these really are the only four Saints that performed documented abortions, or because these were popularized by some expert of Irish history or something, but there are others out there that aren't as well known. It's also possible that they just have more of a widespread and popular mythology about them, that the Catholic church can't scrub out as much. Like the previous poster said, the Bible literally has instructions on how to perform an abortion, so I really doubt that only these four Saints in one time period and part of the world were celebrated for this, compared to some quirk of history and religion making it so that their legend was the one that wasn't overwritten.",

Technically my family was Muslim. But the orthodox Christian man that signed my birth certificate refused to put that on it when I was Muslim so he put down none. That's right. I ended up with a birth certificate that says none on the religious section. I don't know what his motivation was for that. But in any case ever since I was a kid I always had an interest in religion like I had an interest for lore of anything. I find the religion intriguing in its own right even if I don't believe in any of it. I have always believed in God though. Although I always have seen God in a way that no one else that I have met has. I see God as a floating ball of infinite energy. And that that energy is what flows though all of us. When I was a kid I surmised that this is what gave us all consciousness. I also surmised that God gives little to no shits about how you worship them.

Stanton and Anthony joined the faction that did not; and after the amendment passed, many of the suffragists on that side pandered to white southerners by arguing that that if white women could vote, they could drown out the Black male vote.\u201d\n\n\u201cBoth Anthony and Stanton died more than a decade before the 19th Amendment passed. And although their work was instrumental in making that passage possible, they did not work to prioritize making voting rights accessible to all women. In 1920, Black women in the south and many Latinas in the southwest were still barred from voting because of racist voting restrictions. And when they tried to reach out to the main suffrage organizations at the time, they were ignored.\n\n\u201cThey say basically, \u2018Help us, we still can\u2019t vote,\u2019\u201d Tetrault explains. \u201cAnd those organizations basically say, \u2018That\u2019s a race question, it doesn\u2019t concern us.\u2019\u201d\u201d\n\nI am not saying these things to argue with you. I am saying these things bc they are true. Whitewashing history only benefits certain people \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f\ud83d\udc41\ufe0fbut me saying historical generations of feminism in the USA have been centered on the experiences and beliefs of white anglo , Saxon protestant women who don\u2019t really care about others partial perspectives and therefore are contradictory to the very values they\u2019re supposed to be fighting for\u2026 is problematic? ok\u2026",

         "I would not find this funny, but rather ... unattractive. I don't think I'd go on a second date. Implied sexism. Giving me the ick.

         "If you're trying to get me to have a date at a home because you think it will lead to sex, AT LEAST offer to make ME dinner.

Let me guess, he said he doesn\u2019t really use social media, because his accounts probably are full of rightwing bullshit and he thinks he just has to hide it long enough to get laid.\n\nI don\u2019t just think he was trying to Netflix-and-chill, although having a private date to hook up might the reason for the location, I think he\u2019s asking right away if you are willing to cook for him because he is reading more into that question.",

Him: \"my mom makes great chicken curry.\" Me: \"okayyyy.\" Him: moving on.\n\n\nAt every moment that he brought up food, we would have this circle around about him loving some meat dish and how his mom made it really well.

I just looked at him, as we were both sitting in the dining hall, and said \"You think I could cook you dinner?\"  And then he thought about it for a few seconds and seemed to realize how stupid that was.",

I said a few personality traits, then turned the question to him and he's like 'i like a woman who can cook' and that was it. So you don't give a shit about me as a person unless I can do a job for you hm? No thanks",

You don't just get to turn around and upfront suggest I partake in domestic labour for your benefit. If we get to the point where we're an established couple it would be completely fine for you to ask politely if I could cook for you some time. But this is way too early and way too upfront and in your face to be saying such things. \n\nI wouldn't necessarily say that this means you should never see this guy again if you like him though. But he only gets one more chance. You set your boundaries now and if he gets all presumptuous again, then it's definitely time to say bye bye.",

When I told her I didn't have one, she bought me one as a cute gift.\n\nTo be fair though, she did live with her younger brother at the time, so had an insurance plan for the 2nd date\n\nSeven years later she's still stuck with me lol",
         "This happened to me a long time ago. A guy I knew slightly got hold of my number and called me for a date. He then went on to say that I would be cooking him dinner.

I\u2019m way out of the dating game but when I was, if a guy I was into and just had a great date with playfully flirted and asked me to cook him dinner on our next date, I wouldn\u2019t be offended. I\u2019d be down to clown lol, that\u2019s just me as long as the guy wasn\u2019t being rude and disrespectful (demanding vs asking/flirting).",

I\u2019m not a fan of rushing intimacy. you could tell him and see his reaction, but I would be very cautious about seeing him again. he is supposed to be putting forth his best effort, and if this is it, it\u2019s all downhill from here.",
         "Cis male in my 30s here. My jaw is on the floor. I cannot imagine ever saying this to my *wife*, much less to a girl I've been on one date with.\n\nBow out because that's nuts. What must his \"normal\" be, that this didn't raise any flags in his head?",

         "Years ago I very casually went on a few dates with a woman who asked, \u201cWould you cook me dinner?\u201d And I was taken aback bc making dinner for someone is very intimate for me. At least she asked, while this guy sounds ENTITLED to be served!",

If after first date or during 2nd date they bring up again, I will 100% say something in someway similar \"you could cook for me\" or something.\n\nNow, if he just said this out of nowhere, or wants you to go to his or him go to your house, for specifically YOU to cook (not like a cooking date where both cooking) then nah, that was definitely a red flag BUT personally would just keep it going if otherwise fine. Maybe turn that into a discussion talking about food and each others cooking formalities. (gods, now I'm thinking of when my 15 year old \\[foster\\] son was bringing my cooking to the next level in multiple spots because i was a basic and inept LOL)\n\nIf adds on or supports that red flag further of expecting you to cook for him then I would dip. Relationship both parties should be some degree able to do everything themselves, and then also maybe make stuff a fun thing either switching between as gifts to each other or doing together. Not doing this is how you end up with either:  \n1. Abusive relationships  \n2. Widowed husband being unable to take care of kids or house (if we're doing the trashy stereotype thing)  \n3. Widowed wife being unable to take care of finances, work, or stuff (if we're doing trashy stereotype thing)",
         "If you like him, you could say \"only if you cook for me the next time\". This would give you the opportunity to watch his reaction, too. I always assume the worst due to my personality and experiences. Worse things happened than eating at someone's place on a second date (+possible intimacy). Tbh you don't know if he is being forward or sexist so if you like I'd say have a talk, if you are grossed (you were the one there when he said it, so you can guess his intention the best too) then lose him",

Or had there been back and fourth with a bunch of things that weren\u2019t going to work?\n\nEither way, I never liked people knowing where I lived until I knew them well. So, it\u2019d be a no. But if that\u2019s his *first* suggestion, it\u2019s probably a never. \n\nAlso. I hate cooking. So, that idea would go out the window even if I was happy to have them over.",

         "Man chiming in: I'd be aghast when put in that position. I have been in a relationship for a few years, but when dating, I think my reasonable (albeit admittedly quick) plan for something casual is date #1: in public, wherever my date wanted then date #2: I cook dinner, run the menu by the date, ask if they don't mind bringing dessert in a totally non-sexual way, homemade/store bought or whatever. It wasn't rocket science, and had a good success rate, and tests a lot of me/the date (I'm not a creep/I can be in public/date is interested enough to bring dessert, options to flirt)...the bar is so low. I'd stay away from a (34M) who can't even offer to cook you a meal in 2024, life's too short for that shit.",

         "He told you everything you wanted to hear. Charmed you good. Now he's waiting for you to tell him everything he wants to hear.

That\u2019s insane.  It\u2019s really hard to imagine someone saying that earnestly, though that may just be because of who I personally interact with.  Maaaaybe if your conversation somehow came around to how you love experimenting with cooking and trying new things out?\n\nYeah uh, if he was serious then \u201cRun for the hills\u201d is the correct answer.

Then just say something like, \"that's way too fast for me, how about you pick a restaurant and ask me again\".  Many, many things you could say to get that general point across.  Now, his reaction to what you decide to say may turn out to be a sign to run for the hills but you had a good first date probably worth giving him another shot at something more inline with what you want.",

If so, he might be thinking that he's being nice by having you cook when it's your turn so that you don't have to spend much money, especially if you'd noted how expensive it is to eat out these days.  Did you mention enjoying cooking or being good at it?  He might think you want to show off your cooking.  Did he mention he rarely eats out or - conversely - that he's stuck having to eat lots of take-out food?  A nice, homemade meal might sound very appealing to him, especially since he won't be the one cooking it.  \n\nYou're thinking about safety while he may be thinking that he's making things easier for you because it would be a casual and inexpensive date.  (Or he may be thinking this is the start of a beautiful bang-maid relationship.  I dunno; my crystal ball is broken and I don't know when it'll be fixed for obvious reasons.)

I want to be charitable and whatnot.\n\nThe absolute best I can imagine here is: she has spent the whole date passionately elaborating on her special interest in complex gourmet cooking and bragging about her badass kitchen setup. \n\nI can sort of imagine suggesting we cook together / she teaches me, if I got the impression that's something she seemed eager to show off. Even then... I think the furthest I'd actually go is \"How about you text me a shopping list and you can laugh at me while I desecrate your favourite recipe?\"",

Maybe OP could bring it up with him and see how he reacts (even over text)?\n\nThere is a chance (admittedly a small one) he just said it without thinking and is horrified with himself and a text asking about it isn\u2019t expending a lot of effort, and could give him the chance to apologise. Whether he\u2019s worth a text depends on how the rest of the date went I guess",

My ex hasn\u2019t been involved in my son\u2019s life which was perfect for me. 5 years later I\u2019m married, we have a happy, stable, wonderful life that my child also belongs to. Recently I did ancestral DNA testing because I was curious.\n\nWell, my son isn\u2019t related to my ex or anyone in his family. Instead my son shares a genetic history with someone who is like a father to me and a grandpa to my child. I only found out 3 days ago, and it is like no one can comprehend that means I was fucking sexually assaulted by someone I trusted tremendously. I cannot even stomach the idea of speaking to him right now, and I didn\u2019t want to hear lies from him. It makes some level of sense because he\u2019s always had a deep care and spoiling type of relationship with my kid, where he does almost nothing for his own grandchildren.\n\nOne of my closest friends was even flippant, and was like, The good news is you\u2019ll be loaded! I have had similar reactions from everyone else. The REALITY is that I feel deeply betrayed and sad. It is quickly spiraling into this sense of grief, anger, and some sort of lost feeling.\n\nI don\u2019t have the luxury of just pretending it didn\u2019t happen because now I have the burden of knowing it did.

I wanted to know what ancestral background he has so I could share it when he wants it, and raise him strong in the truth and not lies like I was raised with. The rapist had a huge opinion that it was useless and it wouldn\u2019t matter to my son, and that I shouldn\u2019t test him. Which in hindsight means he knew or at least suspected my son is his, which means he knows he raped me. For years he has just lied to me and manipulated me.",

They may say it's vested to just pursue family court and paternity, or they may suggest you go to civil court first, or the police. \n\nCivil court has a lower standard of evidence, while criminal court requires \"no shadow of a doubt\".

Another option is to threaten going to the authorities to get him to sign away his parental rights. The fact that he hasn\u2019t come forward despite how he feels for your child just means he\u2019s afraid that someone will find out. It\u2019s a terrible situation to be in.

Truly though tell everyone that if they ever try to facilitate a reunion, a talk, or having him in the same space as you that you will consider them an accessory to his crime and ejected from your life. Your sanity is of utmost importance and unfortunately, this is when you\u2019ll find out who really cares. Just when you need your support system the most",
         "It\u2019s not your fault. I\u2019m so sorry this man has betrayed you in such a way. I\u2019m please look into getting some therapy or counselling, so you can navigate how to tell your son if/when the time comes. Dementia diagnosis or not, this man deserves to be face the consequences of his actions. You don\u2019t have to talk to him, you could report him to the police and they will take this burden off your shoulders.",

Please get professional counseling as soon as you possibly can. \n\nI hate that the betrayal has been multiplied by the heartless reactions you've received from your friend and others. What happened to you is horrific, and should in no way be minimized, especially not by people who care about you. \n\nI have to ask, when you say that everyone else you've spoken to has been flippant, does that include your spouse?",
         "I highly recommend trauma informed therapy of many kinds. There are quite a few different types of therapy and you can find a therapist and type of therapy that works for you. This is seriously messed up and I can't imagine how completely destabilizing this must be. I am so, so sorry.",

         "If it is going to come out, and I'm someone who tends to think these things do come out, talk to a lawyer so you know what could happen with custody.

         "I am so so so very sorry your sense of safety and reality have been so brutally and abruptly shattered. I know your world has been blown up completely. You\u2019ve been given some great advice here regarding getting a lawyer. I want to address you and your needs right now. \n\nPlease, call your local rape crisis centre. They will be able to help you find a good trauma therapist, they can help you find the appropriate lawyer(s) you may need, they can help you navigate the steps you may want to take with the police and anything else that can and will come up. If you\u2019re not comfortable calling your local rape crisis line or domestic violence shelter (they have a lot of the same information and contacts) please reach out to RAINN. They are national, \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8& \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6 and a great resource. Because your situation involves at least two states, they may be your best resource. I\u2019ve included their link. \n\nI (thankfully?) had a miscarriage when I had a similar situation but I know how traumatic and overwhelming this is for you. \n\nI\u2019m keeping you and your son in my thoughts and I\u2019m sending courage, healing, strength and compassion your way. \n\nGive yourself much grace. You did absolutely NOTHING to deserve any of this. You are 100% the victim, and so is your son, and that creep is a disgusting predator who deserves to be held accountable in as many ways as possible.\nSending cyber hugs from a stranger whose heart hurts for you.\n\nhttps://rainn.org/",

Emotionally I reflect on where I was mentally at the window of time of my son\u2019s conception. It was the holidays and I was very distressed because of other life stuff, and I know I over drank and took Xanax, likely blacking out. It\u2019s all the years of comments about how much my son looks like him as a little boy, sideways comments that led to directly ask if anything had ever happened. He fucking lied for YEARS, and I believed him because I trusted that he loved and respected me enough that he would never do anything like that.",
         "This guy sounds plain EVIL. To take advantage of someone that trusted you like that, that\u2019s just vile. I am sorry this happened to you.",
         "Please know this: people reacting like you describe, being flippant, are absolutely completely wrong. Your feelings - grief, anger, and loss - are entirely appropriate.\n\n\nAll of us here reading this would love to see this creep go to prison. But probably best to talk to a lawyer first to find out how it works, and whether it's in your best interest or not.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd before any of that, get counselling or some serious mental health support, because this is very very serious stuff that no one should go through alone",
         "OP, I am so so sorry this happened. And I hope you know that you are reacting right and valid and I have no clue what is wrong with the people in your life downplaying this. Well actually I do, but lemme not even start on how much that angers me.\n\nIn this moment where you are feeling violated and deceived and manipulated and lied to, I want to remind you of one thing that may or may not help but I think you should know:\n\nRight now, you hold all the cards. How that man spends his twilight years is up to you. Whether he gets to spend them in a cushy retirement home or a jail cell is up to you. Even if you decide not to press charges you have enough evidence to lean on him for him to step up and provide for your son. Not in gifts, not spoiling, but in real tangible and it sounds potentially life-changing ways. I am not saying to blackmail him (but I absolutely wouldn\u2019t judge if you did..) but that you now get to decide how this horrific story gets to conclude. You get to decide what punishment he should face. \n\nIn a moment, where he has completely robbed you of your agency, bodily autonomy, and power, he has somehow now also given you enough evidence to gain some of that power back. You don\u2019t have to use it, but please remember, especially in the moments you feel weak and betrayed, that it is there.",
         "I don\u2019t know if he drugged me or not. My guess is no. That holiday season was very rough and I was in a fairly bad emotional state. I know I would have drank alcohol, and I had an Rx for Xanax\u2026 so I could have caused my own self to pass out, which I knew was a risk because it had happened before. But I felt safe, and frequently stayed at his house when I went to the city, and he even kept a bedroom for me. I stayed because I trusted him 100%. I\u2019m absolutely certain that under no conditions would I have ever voluntarily slept with him because the idea is diagusting and he\u2019s more of a parent to me than my own parents.",
         "Before you do any of this, talk to an attorney. You would NOT want this man to in any way convince a judge that he has rights pertaining to your son.",
         "I\u2019d be worried he\u2019d try to take partial custody of the child!",
         "I asked him directly to do it after seeing the ancestry and he went into how he\u2019d remember if we ever had sex, blah blah lies. He dismissed my request for a lab DNA paternity test. I feel like I should feel more sane before I think of forcing the issue.",
         "This. I wouldn't put too much faith in those ancestral DNA tests. Some of them are basically garbage science",
         "Do I have to file something in court to force a paternity test at a lab if he won\u2019t voluntarily do it?",
         "No most people in my greater family are accounted for by DNA, and the rapist is not related to me or my ex, only my son. I did my sons for the heck of it, wanting to know his percentage on A and B, between my ex and I.",
         "That would be highly, highly unlikely. The chances that her kid got some random person\u2019s results AND that they matched with the rapist\u2019s family would be astronomical. I\u2019m also assuming her child matches with his maternal (the OP\u2019s) family.",
         "That is absolutely horrific. I am so sorry. This must feel like being assaulted *now*. Please, get some counseling, and take care of your mental health. We're all on your side.  /hugs",
         "He didn't have dementia 5 years ago... Press those charges",
         "His current state of mild dementia may not interfere with legal procedures. Unless you're going to inherit a lot of money from him, it may be worth consulting a lawyer to understand legal processes you may need to be involved in and then filing a report with police. You may also be able to file a civil suit.\n\nI'm sorry this happened to you. There's hardly anything that can be more traumatizing and disturbing than this. May he suffer greatly and rot.",
         "I undernstand you and I feel you. He deserves jail and the dementia thing is also deserved and is some kind of jail, he will not be free again in his mind.\n\n\nWish you all the best.",
         "While he might be able to get off, this is quite important information for hospitals, aged care facilities etc to know about.\n\nThis man should not be allowed in mixed wards and mixed dementia units.\n\nEven men with dementia are capable to raping other women in care.",
         "So you\u2019ve already asked him if anything happened?",
         "When your emotions start picking on you, I hope you\u2019ll remind yourself that nothing you can think of would make you responsible for this. It was his decision and his alone. you did not have a say in it. I\u2019m so, so sorry that you\u2019re going through this OP. My heart just breaks for you",
         "I don\u2019t have any advice. Others here have been helping with that. I just wanted to say I\u2019m so sorry this happened to you. What a disgusting misuse of your trust. It\u2019s not your fault.",
         "I know that\u2019s good advice. Thank you \u2764\ufe0f",
         "Thankfully, he was recently diagnosed with mild dementia, and I now live states away. There\u2019s no way a court would find him fit, I\u2019d guess.",
         "Technical question: is he already in the Ancestry DNA database and matched with your son? If so, what % did he match at?",
         "It's 100% a match for paternity. They're sometimes wrong about ethnicity, NOT parental relationship.",
         "Maybe the bs statistics, but matching DNA nearly 50% to this guy is no denying that\u2019s a parent.",
         "you could give him an option of using a home test if you feel safe enough to ask but yes, judicially is the way to go. edit, contact your DSS child support office for the first step. good luck!",
         "Yes, my son matches with me and my family.",
         "The physical part makes me disgusted to consider, but right now I feel most violated by the fact he would do this because I trusted him entirely.",
         "Yes, there is a lot of money in his estate. He owned a large commercial construction for many years and invested well. How do his finances change this?",
         "For years I asked him because he kept doing weird stuff like sending me photo collages of him at my son\u2019s age. Undoubtably they looked alike. Then he pushed me to get my son\u2019s blood type done in case my son was ever in an accident. I\u2019m O+, he\u2019s AB-, my son is B-, and I have no idea about my ex, but figured it was just weird, not that he raped me. Overall he was just more interested and invested in my son than he ever has been with his own family. But it figured it was because I\u2019m like a daughter to him, and he just loves my son so much.",
         "Talk to a lawyer- whether or not he\u2019s competent to be punished may not preclude his being liable to pay support.",
         "I'm sorry for what he did to you.\n\nBut  I am not with the other people here saying you should go hard and press charges and blow everything to pieces. You need to weigh your options here and what is in the best interest of yourself and your son.\n\nSee a lawyer, get a professional opinion of what is likely to happen. A civil suit might be your best course of action for any kind of justice and repeerations.",
         "The Christmas at issue is the one where he bought DNA Ancestry tests. So he, my ex, and I all have profiles, and so do a bunch of my family members. His DNA wasn\u2019t as high as mine to my son, I think 47.something %. I know these tests are not the same as a lab test, and I would need a lab paternity. But this is all is stacking out to look really bad. Years ago he wanted me to have my son\u2019s blood type done in case he was ever in an accident, I\u2019m O+, he\u2019s AB-, no idea about my ex, but my son is B-.",
         "You need someone to talk this over with, though, especially since you\u2019re not getting emotional support from those around you.",
         "It's up to you if it changes anything. It's just that if you report him you will likely be removed from his will. So you have to make a personal choice on if you want to watch him slowly rot of dementia and collect the inheritance. Or if you want to get retribution through law. It doesn't change how awful he is. It's just about which path will give you the most peace. Which only you can decide.",
         "I\u2019m so sorry dear. I think that any correspondence with him like a confrontation or questioning should be recorded or written in email or texts. Get him to admit it. I would also consult with a lawyer.",
         "That makes sense. I would guess that in order to keep his name clean he\u2019d willingly pay anyway.",
         "He knew what he did and felt no remorse about it. Him buying this gift should be included in court testimony.",
         "That's definitely in the parental range percentage. We inherit roughly 50% of our DNA from each parent.",
         "Would his kid be entitled to anything though?",
         "Probably. I would consult a lawyer.",

I don't pretend to be an expert on this stuff but at the same time i like to get down deep into the nitty gritty of who supported it, what it is. How it will affect my town or state.

Wade had become normal, and so they assumed it would always continue.  I've been reading stuff online about Trump, with people saying, \"Oh, he's not going to do all that awful stuff, be a dictator, he was just joking.\"  They don't want a dictator, they're just not able to get past their normalcy bias and see that he does mean what he says.\n\nNow that I learned about that, I plan to keep it in my back pocket for the next time a \"men are more logical\" discussion gets started.

It turned into a debate about women's rights and the importance of voting. He said that the election was making me crazy and I said he was being condescending. Race was brought up, apparently I called him a liar because I asked for a source for a claim he made. Right now we're at a stalemate, I'm not very fast at texting and would prefer to talk over the phone so I gave him a time I would be available. He said I can call him when I  cool off which makes me not want to as the comes off as condescending to me as well.\n\nTo his credit his is intelligent, probably more than I am but in this case there's no way he can be right in my opinion.\n\nI feel like this should be the end of this friendship, I stated that Its his right not to vote but that I would be. The fact that he's not is disappointing but not the reason I feel I should cut him off, the way he went about voicing it is the reason I feel I should.\n\nI just needed to vent, I really don't have many people to talk to about this because other people's opinion of him is not great.",

You say he is 'intelligent', but it sounds like he lacks emotional intelligence.

Your friend would too. \n\nThe big difference here is that I care about my wife. And my niece. And women in general. And people of color. And queer folk. Basically, it takes empathy and not a small amount of energy to worry about the wellbeing of people who don't share my privilege. I can't turn my back on them out of convenience and neither should your friend. \n\nBut you committed the sin of calling him out on that privilege. That's not to say you're wrong. In fact, I feel you're doing the right thing. He needs to face up to what his apathy is really doing. I was pretty apathetic in my youth (up to my 30s, so that tracks with your friend). Nobody enjoys having their privilege called out. I sure didn't. But it was that discomfort that made me re-evaluate my values. I wish I could say it was instantaneous, but it wasn't. I clammed up at first. Lashed out at those called me out. I'm sure your friend is going through the same stages I did. \n\nThere's no guarantee he'll come out of this a better person. I like to think I did. He might not take that route. He might even find comfort in doubling down. There's a lot of relief in ignoring the world's problems when they're not your own. I just hope he does have the empathy to eventually realize what you're talking about. Whether he realizes that before your friendship is demolished is entirely up to his timeline. You can try to be there for him in case he bounces back. Let's hope he does.",

Not only does it perpetuate historically and politically illiterate views, but further reinforces a status quo that erases the voices of non-white individuals who have consistently resisted the US settler state\u2019s violence. The message, even unintentionally, positions US electoral politics as a \"solution,\" overlooking the reality that this system is a tool designed to sustain rather than challenge systemic issues like US hegemony, colonial and imperial violence, racism, patriarchy, and capitalist exploitation.\n\nIn this context, the insistence that certain identities inherently \"require\" participation in electoral politics simply because \"not voting is a privilege\" is itself troubling. It disregards the fact that, for many, voting within this system feels less like a privilege and more like complicity in sustaining a structure built on oppression (including their own oppression). \n\nIs he the ideal person to engage in this discussion? Possibly not. Are his reasons sound? Given the general lack of political literacy in the US, probably not either. I completely understand why you feel the way you do, that isn\u2019t in question.

         "I have to agree, I was really really looking forward to the possibility of DJT fading into the history books, but there's a very real possibility that awful sack of humanity will make it into the presidency. And you are right, if he does, it will only give validation to some awful concepts of acceptance and tolerance in our own government and I am fairly sure there are some politicians just itching for the opportunity to voice some horrible opinions and get away with it.",
         "He was 'talking' to one of my other friends who is also a black woman, we all worked together and she was technically his superior. There was a very bad falling out between the two them and all of the coworkers sided with her. The entire deal was messy but I had further insight into the dealing than I should have or wanted to so I chose to remain his friend after that. \n\nI've fortunately been blessed when it comes to the other male figures in my life including my own partner so this is a new experience for me. Of course I've had men treat me badly but not ones who cared for me.",
         "It's been a sad revelation.",
         "Pennsylvania",
         "He said that calling him condescending was ad hominem whereas calling me crazy wasn't because he said the ELECTION was making me crazy. He out of the blue said that the Democrats were buying votes so I asked for sources and he said he was the source. I said sources don't work that way, and that was separate fight about how I was insulting his intelligence and calling him a liar.",
         "Thank you, I am more leaning towards going separate ways now that I am now seeing other interactions in a different light now.\n\nThis was was two incidents over two separate days which was invited both times by him so it feels like he was looking for a fight? And both times following a vaguely election related joke that HE made and I commented on because I thought it was just banter. I'm not sure what his end game was? Did he think I he was going to get me to throw away my vote? Because neither time did I say he had to vote, it was just me defending why I would be. \n\nOf course he didn't know I had already had my mail in ballot received so it didn't matter anyway.",
         "I would vote independent if I could but I am aware that at this point In time that's the same as throwing it in the garbage. I don't know much about Politics but it feels like one of those things where you gotta walk before you can run, vote Democrat this election and if things improve maybe we can convince the majority to vote independent sometime in The future.\n\nI know that not voting won't help anything.",
         "I stated at the end that I wasn't cutting him off over his opinion but how he went about voicing it. Not agreeing is one thing, saying I'm calling him a liar for asking for a source for his claims, calling me crazy,  telling me I need to cool off before talking to him and asking me if I need help over and over is another. \n\nGranted I did not mention all of that in my OP but I did say I wasn't cutting him off over his opinion.",
         "The fastest way to get the correct answer on the internet is to post the wrong answer.",
         "I put the ball in his court, if he wants to CALL me I will have a conversation about how I believe he treated me unfairly and why I think we should go our separate ways. I will not be calling or texting him though so if this is the end then so be it.",
         "You're so right, after responding to another comment and reading this I remembered him telling me the other woman I mentioned him being attracted to was \"acting crazy\" because she said she didn't want to talk to him anymore. Such a huge red flag right in my face and I missed it.",
         "Yeah, I totally get it.  You and him have built a foundation and this current situation has shaken it.  Tensions are super high right now.  If you value this friendship and you think he can value this friendship, I think y'all should take some time to let the tension clear.  It's going to be a crazy week- so perhaps you can plan a meet-up or phone call for next week and have a long talk with each other.",
         "Could it be that he only liked you when you deferred to his knowledge and needed protection? Benevolent sexism\u2014seeing women as weaker and in need of male assistance and protection\u2014often turns to hostile sexism when a woman stops acting \u201cfeminine\u201d (i.e. when a woman starts being assertive and self-sufficient).\n\nOf course, you\u2019re the only one who knows the ins and outs of your friendship, but it\u2019s something to think about.",
         "I have worked with some astonishing geniuses (patents and stuff) who were remarkably ignorant about how certain aspects of real life worked. (To be fair, the same could be said about the me of 20 years ago.)\n\nBased on him sticking up for you, having been a defender in your career, I'd personally take a step back but keep the connection light. Lots of people's tempers are high right now, and sometimes nurturing those connections longer-term can come in really handy down the line. Even though his attitude sucks on this rather large issue.\n\nWork friends and connections may be very imperfect people, but those connections can still come in very handy when it comes to career opportunities.\n\n(I've also been the person fired for sticking up for someone else, so I get how hard that can be, especially if there are big consequences in a small community. I'd still do it, but now know how to do it in a way that better protects myself.)",

         "He has the luxury of being able to not vote. \n\nRegardless of who wins, he won\u2019t be affected in the same way. \n\nMust be nice.",
         "Sadly, the people who need to recognize their privilege the most won't see it. They'll focus on something else. Why did that black person get the scholarship? Were they really more deserving of it than the white person who worked just as hard? Then that privilege can warp how you value others. If this scholarship is meant for a black person, then that means the white person worked even harder. How does that make sense? It doesn't. It's a defense mechanism to stop us from analyzing the situation. It avoids that discomfort of why would the black person even need consideration that doesn't apply to a white person? \n\nI know sometimes analogies help. I particularly like the foot race where white kids start off 25 meters from the finish line, but minorities may start 30 meters away. Sure, a nonwhite kid could win the race, but when you compare the times of all the kids, the privilege can show through. Not sure that'd help with your friend. He sounds pretty committed to denying it, and since he's shut you out, he may have to come to this realization on his own (if he does). \n\nI've lost some friends due to ideological differences, so I feel you. I never held a formal funeral for them, but I treat them as if they had passed away. Maybe some will realize what was wrong. Good luck.",

It's not for nothing that many households and professional societies ban any conversations and politics and religion.\nIf you value the friendship, consider not discussing some topics.

         "I go to him because I like to converse and connect, but I will also defer to Google just as quick because why not? I've not always been assertive in life but in the last 2 years I've certainly found my voice especially when it matters to me. I've never been overtly feminine although not for a lack of trying, but I am still a woman and I know some men just have that mindset.",

         "Funnilly enough even though I know our experiences arent the same I apologized for his bullying because I didn't want to invalidate his experience.",
         "We both worked at the same place with people who were significantly younger than us so we kinda gravitated towards each other. He was a great person to talk to and always had something interesting to say and discuss. Since we are in a similar stage of life we could commiserate over things that the younger people couldn't relate to. He would give another coworker rides home because she lived 40 minutes away and I thought that was very selfless of him. I thought he was a good guy. \n\nI didnt have any local friends when I started the job so I was happy to have him around."

When it comes to the pro-birth crowd, my response is always, \u201cAfter listening to neurologists and doctors, I am not bothered by Roe v. Wade being the law of the land and also feel sorry for women who find themselves in circumstances that require them to make a choice.

         "Also, abortion rates are up after Roe was overturned. Infant mortality is also up. The pro-life movement is directly leading to more deaths and abortions. \n\nOn average abortions have increased in the US about 11% since the overturn of RvW. [https://www.guttmacher.org/2024/03/despite-bans-number-abortions-united-states-increased-2023](https://www.guttmacher.org/2024/03/despite-bans-number-abortions-united-states-increased-2023) .\n\nInfant mortality raised about 7% and 10% increase in those babies born with congenital anomalies [https://cph.osu.edu/news/2024/10/us-infant-mortality-increased-7-months-following-dobbs](https://cph.osu.edu/news/2024/10/us-infant-mortality-increased-7-months-following-dobbs) .\n\nSo more abortions are happening, more infants are dying, we see healthcare deserts starting and women dying or having significant health problems with difficult pregnancies. If we wanted to absolutely plummet the abortion rate, then support free birth control (especially long-term) for everyone, regardless of health insurance, age, etc. [https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/colorado-birth-control-facts/](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/colorado-birth-control-facts/) talks about a Colorado program along with ACA that dropped abortions by 40%.

In fact their anti-abortion stance forces women to carry unsafe pregnancies to term without any care for the safety of the mother.

         "This isn't an excuse, but an explanation. \n\nPeople who vote \"pro-life\" (anti abortion) do not understand what an abortion is. There is a nurse on tik Tok/Instagram who has a great video about this- her name is Jen something, you might have seen her videos before as she is a labor and delivery nurse. They truly think abortions are performed only for women who choose to use it as a contraceptive method. They believe that killing a baby in utero is wrong. They also hear that Planned Parenthood is willing to perform \"late term\" abortions at any point and will happily perform elective abortions at any point in pregnancy, even up to 40 weeks. \n\nObviously this information is wrong. They don't understand that a woman needing a D&C after a miscarriage is considered an abortion and is medically coded that way. They also think that the laws carving out exceptions for rape and life of the mother are actually working and don't understand that they aren't. They truly aren't exposed to the stories of women who have died waiting on medical care after miscarriages, the story of the ten year old who had to travel out of state to receive an abortion after being raped, and don't hear about the OB's leaving red states in droves due to social media algorithms. Even our news feeds are tailored to our interests and people are less willing to engage with things that don't fit their ideologies, leading the algorithm to provide a feed curated to their beliefs and further cementing their beliefs. \n\nI am a person pretty firmly on the left whereas my husband is more in the middle. When talking about various news topics, I am often surprised to hear that he received different information about whatever thing than I did and it's only because of our conversations in person that my beliefs get challenged and vice versa. Then I often will go research the topic and find a more unbiased view than what showed up in my feed. \n\nBoomers especially aren't tech savvy and I don't think they know this is what is happening. When everyone had to get their news from TV or from newspapers, I think things were less biased but now with social media, there are so many different ways to receive news. There have also been studies done that show that reading something over and over, even if you know it to be false, will often convince you that whatever you're reading is true. So when their algorithm is pushing all these things about how abortion is just terminating healthy babies, they believe it. \n\nIt is important when talking with people who believe differently than you to be curious about their views (i.e. ask, \"Can I ask what life experiences you've had to make you feel that way?) and calmly explain why you feel differently. Genuinely they probably don't know the other side and in order to have productive conversations about this that actually lead to change, we can't be accusing them of wrongdoing or they won't listen. It is frustrating, but calling them dumb or being accusatory won't help.",

It\u2019s personal freedom, autonomy, and the ability to shape our own futures without interference.\n\nAbortion is surely an intensely personal decision, one that I imagine no one arrives at lightly. Yet it\u2019s something up for debate. \ud83e\udd74 The ripple effects are huge - financial stability, emotional wellbeing, physical health, and so much more. Taking away the right to choose doesn\u2019t stop abortions - it only makes them less safe, adding unnecessary risk and hardship to an already difficult situation.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to imagine a world where basic control over one\u2019s body is a privilege, not a given.

Some will if it becomes difficult to obtain again.\n\nOne thing I do see changing if contraceptives and abortion are outlawed is that women might go back to being very resistant to sex before marriage.

         "Does it matter all that much? You are incompatible with them. This is good to know.\n\nI'm sure some of them are struggling with thier own shame, or disagree and won't say it, or just think you're too political/too activist/whatever.\n\nBut I'm a woman who has also dated women, and I probably wouldn't date you either. I worked in non-profits and NGOs most of my life and I'd probably step away from dating someone with that dream as well. Hell, I'd donate, and I'd want to be your friend, but I wouldn't date someone with that passion. I know it's emotional toll, I know what that work entiails and I'd be very hesitant to enter into a long-term household/financial relationship with someone who had that very laudable goal, but one I couldn't make central to my own life. My emotional well isn't that deep. I stick to food security and arts access and even that freaking devastated me some days.\n\nI went on a date almost 12 years ago with a wonderful woman, whose dream was to leave the city and open an animal rescue and llama farm. It was a huge part of why we sort of fizzled out quickly between us. Now she has the llama farm and wife who loves that damn farm with her, and I visit twice a year and have a lovely time -- and then go back to the life I actually like in the city. No harm no foul.",
         "Many reasons. They might not be politically aligned with you, they might want to date someone with finance/career aspirations more like their own, or they might have experience with the shelter system or domestic violence or sex work or the \u201cnonprofit industrial complex\u201d and want to stay away from that whole sphere.\n\n(Personally, even though I think this is an admirable goal, I would not want a serious relationship with someone who\u2019s trying to start a new nonprofit because I have experience working in that sector and know it to be emotionally exhausting, badly paid, and leading to a lot of cynicism and burnout.)",
         "I think that\u2019s pretty heavy, people that work with homeless, DV, or just general trauma situation are gonna tend to carry some of that weight at times in their own lives.\n\nI think it\u2019s admirable and would increase my interest in someone, but I might also be wary or intimidated and wonder if I have the emotional depth to keep up with someone that works with trauma.",
         "It is a good cause no doubt, but this type of projects consume a lot of time, physical and mental energy. The people I have met that do stuff like this have their whole life revolving around it.\u00a0\n\nTo turn it around would you be thrilled with a guy making it clear his biggest dream is to work on his own startup 24/7, and on top of that the idea is not to make much money, if anything at all. Would you think he would be a great parent or partner, or would you look elsewhere?\u00a0\n\u00a0",
         "I'll be honest - my spouse was employed with a housing assistance program, and it caused burnout. In both of us. \n\nThey were dealing with so many people in crisis, many of which should not have been left on their own but there was nothing my partner could do about the mental health or executive functioning help the clients needed besides providing and making the initial call to resources. Many of them were, understandably, angry about their situations. Many of them would take their frustrations on out my partner, who was also getting paid barely above minimum wage and had their own troubles. There was no escape, because their supervisor would tell my partner to \"give them grace\" and would only intervene if violence was threatened.\n\nAnd they would come home. And I would ask them to unload it to share the burden.\n\nWe couldn't keep this up for 3 months before shit hit the fan. I felt neglected and dreading seeing my partner some days, and I felt terrible about it. My partner felt dead inside and it reached their eyes.\n\nAs much as I respect the people who can and do have the resources to make a difference in starting up and working these programs, I could not see myself dating someone in that position again without assurance from them that they are on top of caring for their own mental health AND we would get at least one decent date day a week.\n\nDoes that mean all of these men have the same reasoning? No. But I do want to acknowledge that there can be deep, personal reasons why someone would not be compatible with your vision without being a complete asshole.",
         "Good friends of mine, that's her goal, she works with nonprofits doing such.  He has volunteered to staff booths at rallies.  \n\nThe point of dating is to drive away the incompatible people, not attract them!",
         "It doesn\u2019t really matter if they are abusers themselves or have some other reason for not wanting to spend their time with someone committed to an ideal. \n\nThey are not for you. And that\u2019s not the way you are thinking about it, but should: they are not the right person for YOU. Because you need someone who is excited to be with a strong, passionate woman, and they are not that person.",
         "Apart from all the good points mentioned by others, could it also be not about the non profit but maybe that you are so passionate about it that once you get started on the topic you kind of steam roll the conservation and it is no longer an equal conversation? likely totally not be the case, I just thought I mention it just in case. Especially if you are also on the neurodivergent spectrum (again I don\u2019t have any reason to believe you are, just an in case mention), you might not realise that you get stuck on your favourite topic and that certainly can be off putting no matter the topic.",
         "People are listing very valid possible options in the comments. But it could also simply be that these men don't want someone who is going to be running a non-profit of any kind. If the relationship becomes a long-term, serious commitment, a partner whose career is in the non-profit industry is not going to be contributing financially to a significant degree. They may wish for a partner who is on more equal footing with a traditional career.\n\nI personally probably would not date a man whose career is in non-profit or intends to go that way. In this economy, I'm not interested in having to financially support someone who is able to have a reasonably fruitful career that's at least equal to mine but won't (as admiral as the choice is in this case). I would like to be able to own a home one day. I can do so alone and intend to for my first one, but with a partner who can contribute at least roughly what I can, we can afford something a bit better eventually",
         "Obviously without being there to listen to your conversations I can't say for sure but there's probably a good chance you've made this issue your entire personality and activists are exhausting to be around. It's okay to care about things but if you can't compartmentalize and it always leaks into your daily life/conversations then people are going to keep their distance from you to protect their peace -  nobody wants to listen to doom and gloom on a daily basis. \n\nWinning people over is a skill that requires patience and tact - not brute force.",
         "It could be any number of reasons. But they're doing you a favor because you deserve a partner who thinks your ambitions are cool and exciting.",
         "I'm not gonna try to answer why they lose interest because, honestly, I think those are awesome things to want to do. \n\nWhat I will say is this: You deserve someone who believes not just in you but in these dreams also. If they don't then it's no big loss for you. \n\nI wish you the best in your dreams and hope you're able to help many people who need it.",
         "I think you\u2019re dating the wrong men\u2026\n\nI\u2019ve been in nonprofit work for years and my husband has always supported my work and clients. He and his family often volunteered at events and my FIL became a long term volunteer at one of my former workplaces. You need to find someone who aligns with your values and passion.",
         "They are doing you a huge favor by self-excluding.",
         "You\u2019re putting them through an early filter. Anyone that leaves for any reason related to that is not someone you should have in your life.",
         "Yeah, those could very well be the reasons.\n\nAlso, some may lose interest b/c they're just very self involved and see \"woman problems\" as boring and irrelevant to them. Maybe it's one less check mark in the \"interests we share\" column, or maybe they're annoyed that you have \\*any\\* passion outside them.\n\nMaybe they're one of those misogynists who consider all women's issues to be automatically un-serious, as if you'd said you want to dedicate your life to ancient aliens or proving that Jesus used marijuana.\n\nMaybe they hear it as \"this woman will never make very much money.\" They can't mooch off of you, perhaps, or you're not as \"high value\" \\[rolls eyes\\] as them or that you don't have career goals in common.\n\nMaybe some of them have really good, very personal reasons related to this issue-- though it seems really unlikely that this would be so common that OP would notice a strong pattern.\n\nMy guess is that the reasons are \"all of the above,\" ranging from person to person but most knee-jerk reactors probably couldn't articulate it to themselves beyond \"ew.\"\n\nNot that any of that matters b/c a \"no\" is a \"no,\" but one does wonder.",
         "I wonder if it may simply be that this is something that would require a lot of your time. Time you would not be spending on/with them.",
         "You will find a supportive partner when the time is right. Good luck with your work.",
         "You'll attract the right friends who support this long-term outreach that will be an ongoing process. If you had a cat or a dog, you would cause some people to back off. If you were a police officer or a minister, you would need a spouse who accommodated that. This is normal. Musicians who tour need partners who support their careers. Actors often marry other actors and sometimes that works and other times it fails. The right partner and friends will support you through ups and downs, for better or worse. Anyone else will get out of your way to make room for the right people to enter your life and focus on. \n\nBest wishes and let me know how I can help you set up sustainable revenue. I strongly recommend the revenue model taught by real estate investor groups like Kaylee McMahon The Apartment Queen  program, and the ladies at equity academy. Dottie Laster of Laster Global consults with community leaders in using RICO laws to reclaim restitution for trafficking victims so research that in order to work with law enforcement to secure funds or property that communities or victims can claim who were affected by trafficking and racketeering including drug houses and any property abused for  trafficking.",
         "As a woman who survived DV - I don\u2019t know if you realize the danger you\u2019ll be putting yourself in. Most people who work in that line have survived it themselves and want to turn around and help others once they heal. You will 100% need serious therapy to cope with what you hear. As someone who hasn\u2019t lived it yourself, it\u2019s going to be extremely hard for you to see them repeatedly go back. You will see people you work with be killed. You\u2019ll see a level of terrorization and control that will deeply damage your faith in humanity.\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to be passionate about DV. It\u2019s another to make it your cause when you aren\u2019t a former victim. You don\u2019t understand why the women stay, you may think you do, but you don\u2019t. You\u2019ll see the courts repeatedly fail women and their children. You\u2019ll see children sent to live with absolutely awful people simply because it will harm the primary partner.\n\nDV is one of the heaviest topics you can bring up in conversation. There are ways you can help without founding an organization. What is it you think you can do better than what already exists? Are you aware of how unbelievably complex it is? \n\nAlso, I\u2019m willing to bet it is often assumed you\u2019re a survivor. Very, VERY few guys are willing to handle that. It will upset people that you\u2019re a walking reminder of how awful the world is. Also, you don\u2019t mention actually having volunteered with DV organizations yet. It is not a normal thing for a 17 year old to want to do and men may be making assumptions about your childhood and parents. \n\nFinally, you\u2019ll never make money doing this. Certainly not the kind of money you need to survive. Do not EVER set yourself up to live a life where you may become financially dependent on a man. You need to figure out how you\u2019re going to afford to live alone while doing this. \n\nUse your passion to volunteer. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that. Of all the life causes to choose, you\u2019ve picked an extremely dark one. \n\nI say all of this as a survivor. I have personally traumatized well trained, specialized therapists by telling my story. I know because they told me after I completed the program and it didn\u2019t upset me to learn, I felt empathy for them. Compassion fatigue is real and there\u2019s only so much a person can take. That\u2019s why I\u2019m saying that it\u2019s naive to make it your life mission. DV will never stop. It will never get easier. You can help victims but you can\u2019t prevent new ones being made. It. Will. Eat. You. Alive.",
         "I think it's very commendable! But at the same time its also all consuming it's difficult to juggle that goal and still have the bandwidth left over for a partner but i'd say dont give up on and it keep trying!",
         "I\u2019m not sure most people are aware enough to think about the fact that it\u2019s hard work that you may bring home. Maybe financial aspects are relevant. And of course the fact that it\u2019s for women, even if it\u2019s not said straight because \u201cmen are victims too\u201d. I think that is the most likely reason.",

         "Completely unrelated to your good question, I heard a thing the other day, that many shelters can't take in people's pets, so women wind up staying in bad situations because they care for a dog or a cat or iguana. It would be amazing if you get your work off the ground if you kept this in mind and were able to help women in this situation as well.\n\n\nNo pressure tho.\u00a0",
         "Passion jobs like running a DV shelter suck the soul out of people who go into them wanting to help people and spend their days filling out bureaucratic forms and fighting the city zoning board.  It's really hard to be the partner of someone coming to grips with that. (Source: my dad followed his soul, and my mom occasionally slipped up and mentioned that she regretted marrying him.) \n\n\nSocial services sector jobs are notoriously underpaid relative to the level of education needed to get them.  A friend of mine was a social worker in Chicago, and quit to be a high end restaurant server, because it was far more money, far less stress, and no nightmares. And that was a government job with nice benefits.  What you are talking about will be unlikely to have even that much financial cushion; you'll probably have a hard time just making the payments on your student loans.  (Money isn't everything, but lack of money kills more relationships than anything else.) \n\n\n(Side note: are you doing well enough in your studies that you'd be accepted into a Master of Social Work graduate program? That's pretty much the cutoff for getting a meaningful position in that field.) \n\n\nIn addition to all of that, while wanting to help sex workers and domestic violence victims is certainly a laudable goal, people who are drawn to any kind of work helping the disadvantaged are, to be blunt, often not much fun to be around.  Not everyone wants to be constantly reminded of inequities in society. \n\n\nAnd then above and beyond all that, you want to help victims of gender and sexual violence.  That just adds another layer on top of enough deal breakers for most people. \n\n\nSuggestion: try meeting people who work for other nonprofits, both to date and to network with.  \n\n\nSuggestion 2: Find organizations already doing this kind of work, and spend 20 hours a week volunteering, which should eventually get you a trust level to see what goes on under the surface.  Maybe this will ignite your passion, maybe it will dampen it, but you'll have a better grounding to plan your future. \n\n\n(And if you can't see putting in 20 hours a week just to test out how you feel about this path in life, then it's probably not for you -- running a shelter isn't a 40 hour workweek, it's going to be 60 or 70.)",
         "There's a big stigma against victims of dv and sws. I'm like you and afraid that men who don't like you wanting to help victims are abusive themselves. I think a lot of men look down on victims and sws too tho. I'm proud of you for standing your ground!",
         "Just saying that's awesome. Have you looked into grants, tax credits, and zero interest loans from government or other nonprofits? I know a nonprofit in NY that helps businesses get started.",
         "\n\nResponsible and proper people look at this not as a job but a life. Your life will be filled with helping people every day and dealing with probably some of the worst things people will see. Life will be tough, It will be stressful, it will mean odd and long hours, and depending on how it's done with terrible pay. But it's fulfilling and is an absolute marvel that you're willing to do this. It's not a life cut out for everyone, and some people can be honest about it. \n\nBack when I was single, I worked shift work IT and some late nights, and lots of women I talked to were turned off/away because of that alone. It simply wasn't the life they wanted.\n\nFor what it's worth, amazing job! And kudos for helping. And while I'm helping my own wife realize her dream of being a nurse, it will end up in hard hours, stress, and some very crappy days, I don't know if I would have accepted this life before I met her. \n\nFrom a guy, don't settle. Find a guy who realizes your passion and will assist you with it. Best of luck with everything",

My partner has 0 of that towards that. So, when I talk about it, about how the writing is pretty lazy, or they just crap on the subject material, my partner just tunes out, they don't care. Now turn that story Into something where Instead of Sci-fi, it's the person's gender and you are talking about how much they suck, are gererslly violent and generally just POS. No one likes to hear how much a group they're part of sucks. All the time. \n\nAnyway, first 4 months should be easy street and falling in love, eating, drinking, laughs, and having tons of sex.

I think they believe 'a lot' of women lie about DV, and due to sexism and real life experiences, they don't take real women's accounts of abuse as credible, and the idea of you working to help 'those people' highlights the differences between the two of you.

That said, it means providing a safe space and that will mean figuratively and sometimes literally putting yourself between abusers and their victims. There are very real safety concerns, especially if you're in the US and I know I would personally struggle with knowing my partner was potentially in danger. It's the same reason I probably wouldn't date a firefighter or someone with other potentially dangerous jobs. \n\nThe financial aspect could also be a hurdle. I know that many shelters are under-funded and I've heard plenty of stories about volunteers paying for things out of their own pocket so those using the shelter have what they need. If you're this passionate about it, can you say that you wouldn't make personal sacrifices financially for the sake of the shelter? You may be prepared for it, but a lot of people aren't. \n\nI'll just end with a brief anecdote of my own for an alternative perspective. In my 20s, I volunteered on a committee for a charity event to collect donations for a women's shelter. When it came time to deliver everything, I had the most flexible schedule (being self-employed) so it was my responsibility to arrange delivery of the items to the shelter. When I communicated with our contact at the shelter, she asked me to meet off-site. I don't remember the conversation exactly, but it had something to do with me being an unfamiliar man and even though I regularly get a police vulnerable sector check for my other volunteer work, they were concerned my presence might trigger someone at the shelter. I know this probably isn't a common experience but honestly it stuck with me.",

         ">I\u2019ve noticed that as soon as I talk about these dreams, men immediately lose interest. Why is that?\n\n>\\[...\\]\n\n> **I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s because they are abusers themselves**\n\nCouldn't this kind of answer your own question though, at least for some of the men?\n\nRightly or wrongly, some guys, when they hear your dream, will think you will be quick to think the worst of them due to all the horrors you will see other men perpetrating on women. It will be hard not to automatically think the worst of all men when you start digging deep into the awfulness. And in your case, it seems they might not be entirely wrong to be concerned.  Being insufficiently supportive of your career choices leads you to assume that the most likely reason is they are sexual abusers themselves.  Obviously couples need to be able to talk about things like careers without one person being labelled a sexual abuser for disagreeing with the other. \n\nThere are a lot of reasons to not be interested in pursuing a career doing this, or be interested in a relationship with someone who does. I watch too many people get poured out and burned up doing valuable noble non profit stuff, but it's really just them sacrificing themselves to be doing things that a functioning civil government that cares about people over profit ought to be doing anyway.  I feel like they are being exploited by a society that doesn't want to fix the problem themselves. Any non profit dedicated to fixing societies ills is a hard job. \n\nYour goal is great, but its hard work and takes a lot out of you. You will need and deserve a partner who is every bit as emotionally invested in it as you are. It needs to be their passion too.  I don't think it will work long term with a partner who is just grudgingly accepting of it. \n\nIt will likely permanently change your outlook on life. It's similar to how police officers and investigators who spend a lot of time investigating child abuse cases often don't want any children of their own.",

         "First, there are the obvious negative ones. I'm sure some contingent of men don't want DV or SW talked about as issues for various less than great reasons. Some men probably also don't want to contend with a woman of strong beliefs/opinions. I would expect that this covers the bulk of the cases. However, I think if someone was seriously considering a long term relationship that there would be some actual concerns with this sort of work.\n\nSecond, it is a profession that deals with a lot of trauma. Psychologists, social workers, attorneys who work with child victims, and similar have the same issue. It is important work, but it is incredibly hard work that can have a very negative impact on their mental health. My wife works in a school with a fair bit of poverty, and there are a lot of nights of just trying to soothe the pain of situations that neither of us can impact. In some ways life is easier just pushing paper somewhere to make a billionaire richer. You can ignore problems you don't see every day.\n\nThird, starting and running a shelter is likely to be the kind of work that requires massive amounts of your time and resources and returns very little in the way of monetary compensation. That can be stressful in a relationship and may not be something they are willing to contend with.\n\nFourth, I'm sure there is some worry of safety in those situations. Sheltering women from crazy battering spouses would I imagine carry similar spousal worries to something like police work or fire fighting. Hopefully, safety protocols are in place and followed, but the risk of dangerous situations seems a lot higher than say accounting or mechanical engineering.",

Because just doing the intense work to me is a red flag I'm not sure I can handle (or would want to handle) as someone who also watched my mother work with children with disabilities - the strain it put on our family. Even still, I've seen probably a hundred more tiny coffins than most people have, and that's something that me and my siblings can never get back - as someone who likes the idea of starting a family, I don't know that I'd want them that close to those harsh realities in general, and don't really agree with the choices my parents made.\n\n\nBut being the one who starts and runs a foundation? That adds another level. It's not just going to work with victims, it's being the one that's in charge of everything, the one that attends every meeting, and the one that's on call 24/7. I get the sense that dating the OP would be like being in a relationship with a driven business owner who prioritizes the business over the rest of their life, just instead of all of the benefits of normally dating a business owner you get emotional burnout.\n\n\nWhich frankly - I wouldn't date that ultra driven business owner either",

Am I implying that  men who love the outdoors aren't good enough for a romantic relationship? Not at all. They're just not the right fit for me. And I suspect they'd feel the very same about me as an indoorsy person.\n\n\nCertain facets of who we are mean that some people will not want us as partners. When it comes to things like lifestyle or life goals, it's not about being good enough or not. Goodness or worth isn't what is being measured. Compatibility is being measured. Sometimes a given aspect of how we live our life significantly shrinks the dating pool. That is unfortunate, but if whatever that is is something important to us, we shouldn't cast away what we treasure solely to widen the potential dating pool.",

I think it's wonderful, and I think it can be wonderful for someone else, and I think there are people out there for people like you, and you deserve a person that can do that.\u00a0\n\n\nThat person is just not me.

Those of us at the front can't do our jobs without everyone behind us supporting us.  Hell, I couldn't do it if I didn't have a wife who can't work and chose to stay at home & support me.  She makes like 90% of my food and quite literally keeps me alive.  I couldn't do my job without her.\n\nYou're doing good work, and it's work that needs to be done.  There's nothing wrong with setting those boundaries and taking care of yourself first.  You've gotta take care of yourself first to help others, and you can't do that if you're trying to help folks outside of your capacity.  My team's motto is \"self-care is client care\" for that reason.  You doing your thing means someone like me has the ability to do theirs.  We need the whole village to take care of each other.

      "text": "",
      "comments": [
         "These laws were often put in place to prevent men from leaving their pregnant spouses during pregnancy and then skipping out on their financial and parenting obligations. Women can still completely separate (including legal separation) from their spouse while pregnant and then a divorce is finalized shortly after the baby is born usually with no court appearance required. This is meant to protect pregnant women from getting a divorce agreement that doesn\u2019t include the necessary custody and child support provisions they need when their baby is born.",
         "That\u2019s a really poor article. All states have restrictions, even the bluest states. Divorces can\u2019t be finalized if the woman is still pregnant (doesn't matter if it\u2019s a same sex couple, and if both women are pregnant, it both babies have to be born). Primarily the reason behind this is that the child is going to be legally the child of both parents, and they'd just have to come back to family court (whether or not it's challenged). Need to get the child support and custody arrangement.",
         "Even in Illinois a few years ago, my lawyer said it\u2019s difficult to get a divorce if you\u2019re pregnant. I had to sign a document stating I wasn\u2019t pregnant.",
         "If Maryam divorces Jose and gives birth to a baby a month later, she has to go back to court, possibly prove paternity, and try to get a separate order for child support and custody arrangements. \n\n\nIf Maryam waits until after the baby is born to finalize the divorce, then the baby is legally Jose's unless Jose proves non paternity, (in most jurisdictions) and child support and custody can be part of the divorce decree. \n\n\nGiven how long it takes most divorce cases to move through the courts, it makes sense for both the courts and the parents to have the proceedings be one and done. \n\n\nThe laws don't say a pregnant spouse can't leave the marriage, file for legal separation, get spousal support, or file divorce paperwork, just that the divorce cannot be finalized until such a big set of questions is answered. \n\n\nThis is not the right bit to get outraged about, as others have said.\n\n\nThe only time I can see this as being a huge problem is if a couple has been separated for a while, or if the child is a product of an affair, and the baby's biological father wants to step up and marry the mother before the baby is born. (Something very close to this happened to a friend of mine.  Divorce was finalized Friday, baby was born Saturday, they got married Monday.)",
         "The whole idea someone else has to allow people, pregnant or not pregnant, to divorce is archaic.",
         "I'm more and more thankful to not live in America.  That's just awful, what the fuck?!",
         "This doesn\u2019t make sense. It\u2019s not like men who were never married to a women get excused from child support",
         "It\u2019s concerning how women\u2019s rights are being chipped away from all sides lately. The freedoms my mother and grandmother had seem stronger than what we\u2019re left with today. \n\nIf a married woman were truly content, there would be no need to seek divorce. But in many cases, there could be domestic violence, verbal abuse, or other harmful dynamics. For pregnant women, this becomes not just an issue of emotional well-being but a serious health concern for both mother and baby, adding urgency to the need for protection. It\u2019s ultimately about survival and safety.",
         "Colorado also. I know someone who was trying to divorce her abuser while pregnant. They'd been legally separated for over a year and she'd had a restraining order for even longer. Suffice to say, it wasn't his kid. No one who knew her needed a paternity test to be certain of that.  \n\nBut because of legalese, the judge wouldn't sign off until either they both signed a thing saying it wasn't his kid, or they had a custody agreement for the kid. Dude tried to refuse to sign. He changed his tune when she said \"go ahead and claim it's yours. I'll point out you would've had to violate the RO to impregnate me and I'll tell the judge I didn't consent for you to be in my line of sight, never mind do that.\"  He didnt feel like calling her bluff on that and signed.",
         "No they don\u2019t, they have to go to family court just like people who get a divorce. That court case has to be brought by the mother seeking support in the case of a father trying to shirk his responsibilities. Waiting until after the baby is born makes this a one step process rather than separate divorce and child custody/support cases. \n\nIf you make the woman go back for support in a second case some women won\u2019t do that for a variety of reasons, this protects them.",
         "As multiple other people have stated, nothing is stopping someone from beginning the process, nor leaving their spouse.\n\nThere is so much bad shit going on right now where rights ARE being stripped away. Can we please try to focus on those versus going after something that\u2019s a non-issue?",
         "I understand and hear your frustration, but to say that our freedoms are weaker than those of our mothers and grandmothers is simply untrue, and severely downplays their struggles. It wasn\u2019t until 1937 that women in the US could initiate divorce at all. (Had to google that because I'm from Europe.) It wasn\u2019t until the 1970s that women could get credit cards or take out a loan on their own, without a man co-signing on it. \n\nYes, reproductive rights and women\u2019s rights altogether are crumbling around the world, but we are not worse off than our ancestors just yet, though we do need to fight to uphold what they built for us.",
         "I think there is also a need to distinguish legal divorce from physical separation. It\u2019s not necessarily right or okay that a woman cannot get divorced if she\u2019s pregnant, but it does not mean she is not able to leave or get out of an abusive or dangerous situation. She can be accepted by women\u2019s shelters, DV shelters, or even just a friend or family member\u2019s house where her partner can\u2019t get to her. \n\nThese things don\u2019t necessarily replace the emotional relief of being legally divorced from a partner, but they can initiate a feeling of safety for both the woman and her child.\n\nMany times, people think they have to have all their ducks in a row before they leave (ie divorce filed, new job, childcare, etc.) but you do not! Your health and safety are more important than having everything figured out! Make a plan, call a friend or shelter, get your bags and go. The risk to your life and safety is absolutely more important to prioritize than the legal status of your marriage or the financial situation you are in (even if the latter feels incredibly important in the moment).",
         "This isn\u2019t a new thing. This isn\u2019t us having fewer rights than previous generations. This law actually makes it easier for pregnant women to establish paternity and get child support. You\u2019re focusing on cases where the woman wants to leave, what about cases where the man wants to abandon his pregnant partner?\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to be mad about these days. This isn\u2019t one of those things.",
         "This has been law in many states for decades. Nothing has changed in most cases. \n\nPlenty of people have explained why it is and it makes perfect sense. You\u2019re making a fuss about a totally normal thing (it\u2019s like this in my state, too, which is not in the US)",
         "You can still separate but it\u2019s a paperwork semantics for the divorce.",
         "You make it seem like the pregnant woman can't leave she can separate they just can't finalize a divorce before a baby is born. This law doesn't affect anyone it protects women it gives them a leg to stand on in courts for child support and loads of other things.",

This is even more dangerous now than it was decades ago because bacteria are harder to fight, resistant to drugs, etc. \n\nThis isn\u2019t a cut you can slap neosporin on.

It requires general anesthesia, even when done by ob-gyn surgeons, because that tool is very sharp, so the pregnant person can't move at all.  In the global health world, it's called sharp curettage, which is pretty descriptive. It has higher risk of complications even when performed by a gynecologist than a vacuum/suction abortion, which is what a \"surgical abortion\" means for gestational age under about 14 weeks (depending on the skill of the provider).  \n\nIn the US, a suction abortion is often still referred to as curettage or suction curettage, because language evolution is messy and med students are taught by old school physicians.  This confuses a lot of people. D&Cs are still done in the US for other gynecological needs like removing uterine polyps, but it's not recommended for an abortion before 14 weeks GA.\n\nThe Jane Collective did indeed do D&Cs, but they were taught by a doctor, and had observed many before they ever tried it themselves. Your best friend's friend has much safer options: get assistance and go out of state, or use misoprostol (preferably with mifepristone, but misoprostol-only is much much safer than sharp curettage without anesthesia).\n\nPlease update us on this, a lot of us are going to be worrying.",

The Democrats actually spent a lot more money in Texas than they normally do this year because of how many more people have voted blue in the last 10 years.

Even if my vote cannot possibly change the results, I need it out there for when the popular vote results are shared. \n\nI'm already grossed out that this could be a close election.

People for Trump, who never cared to vote before in their lives, are going to be turning up for him. \n\nAnyone who doesn't turn up to put their vote against him,  even if it won't change the results but is only to show others that it isn't acceptable, is not someone I trust to be in my circle. That is someone who will give lip service to you in your time of need but stab you in the back for no other reason than that it allowed them to avoid putting their shoes on. \n\nThink of the boost it has given Trump supporters to see that there are others who think and feel the way they do. People who kept their most atrocious thoughts to themselves to avoid the repercussions have been emboldened to come out of the woodworks and throw their weight around, having seen that there are others who agree with them.\n\n Imagine them thinking that number is higher because cowards and lazy fools like your friends made their view look even more popular. Imagine what those people are going to do, how they will behave, and how they will change the course of our country with the validation that will give them.

I'm not saying it wasn't already bad, but Look at how people who used to hold their tongue about their disgusting views now feel safe to openly harass transgender people simply because they perceive that they have an army of people who agree with them, and many even feel it's the cool thing to do. It was already happening, but believing that their view is the majority is making it worse. \n\nThey should be afraid to express their bigoted views for fear of being shamed. We need to show them that, even if they don't know *who* will hold them accountable, we are out here. We need them to pause before they act out in their hate and oppression, knowing they are surrounded by people who will not tolerate them, and we need those who will speak up for what is right to *see* the army of allies standing around them.\n\nIf you can express that to your friends and they still refuse to put their shoes on, I think it is wise to question their character and find better friends. \n\nMaybe those friends will come around eventually... and as someone who used to do mental gymnastics to justify the views that a bigoted church told me I was supposed to have, showing them your disappointment and holding them further away for their choices might be the most loving thing you can do for them.\n\n Don't enable them.

         "We rarely talk about the outgrowing of friends. I find that people who are choosing to opt out of voting or, who are choosing to write in a candidate who has no chance are often very young, or are wholly unfamiliar with the reality of countries outside the U.S. where there is no option to vote or elections are ACTUALLY fixed (looking at you Venezuela and Russia). This lack of maturity will frequently manifest in other areas of their life\u2026 finances, career, relationships, etc.  My roommate is a friend who is living with me because his housing fell through and he had no place to go; he was unprepared. He can\u2019t afford to split rent and I agreed to allow him to pay what he can with his exit date coming next spring. While I prefer to live alone, maturity has taught me to sacrifice wants for needs and having him as a roommate is helping with my student debt. Politically speaking, maturity has also taught me that there will NEVER be a perfect candidate and that while a 2 party system and the electoral college both objectively suck\u2026 they are the reality of what we have right now. My roommate wrote in Jill Stein this morning, which is his right, and I appreciate him showing up (he was planning to abstain) but ultimately, while his participation matters, his vote does not. He reasoned that, while he sees Trump is unflappably horrific, Harris will continue the Biden-backed campaign of funding the Palestinian genocide\u2026 and he is correct. She will definitely do nothing to de-escalate that situation. However, he fails to accept that with Trump, movements to protest that genocide will become violently suppressed. He is male and the loss of bodily autonomy is not something he can empathize with.  He writes in his vote based on adolescent ideals instead of adult acceptance of a complex reality\u2026 and this lack of maturity shows up across the board\u2026 in his career, in his marijuana and video game addictions, in the abysmal filthy condition of his room\u2026. And that is all ok. It just means\u2026 we have outgrown each other and hold incompatible values. At 40, I\u2019ve learned that this outgrowing of friendships due to misaligned non-negotiable values, is quite common. It is a sad yet consistent reality and part of the human experience. I know when he moves out in May, the friendship will swiftly disintegrate and I\u2019m ok with that because I\u2019ve also learned\u2026 this leaves new space for people who are a better fit, to enter in\u2026 for me and for him.  I understand your frustration with your friends\u2019 decision not to vote. That is their right. All you can do is consider if these friends are too far removed from your non-negotiable values. Your feelings are valid and remember, we all deserve to be in friendships with people who hold the upmost respect for us\u2026 that goes for you and for them.",

It's so frustrating to me to vote in elections because, unless you're siding with one of the 3 main parties, you may as well not vote at all because it won't have an impact on anything. Sure, people can see what percentage voted for alternative or independent candidates but it's never even near a majority percentage and so the main parties will never be concerned enough to change. \nThis time around I've decided I'm not wasting my vote on people I don't think deserve it.

It is the responsibility of the federal government to uphold these rights consistently across the nation, ensuring every individual has access to the care they need, regardless of where they live.\n\nTrue freedom of choice includes making decisions about your body and health without unnecessary government interference or local restrictions. Abortion rights are about protecting that fundamental freedom and ensuring that all women have equal access to essential healthcare services.",
         "Yup, it\u2019s awful. The six-week limit is calculated from the first day of the last period so you effectively have about two weeks after a missed period to get an abortion. You must also attend at least two in-person physician appointments, with a minimum of 24 hours between them. The first appointment is for \u201ccounseling\u201d and consent, and the second is for the procedure.\n\nOur friend doesn\u2019t track her cycles - she\u2019s honestly very under informed about her body sadly, we just had to teach her what ovulation is. So basically she texted my wife around week 7 like it\u2019s weird I haven\u2019t gotten my period yet and my wife was like uhh when were you supposed to and she had no clue. My wife was like dude you\u2019re probably pregnant so she bought a test and sure enough.

But voting for the first time can be exhillarating and even fun. A lot of places make you feel like a rockstar when they know you are a first time voter and most polling places have the kindest volunteers there to help you through the process. It is scary until after you get through it the first time, and then you feel such a wash of pride and joy - both that you conquered your fear and that you participated in our wonderful privilege to vote.

The technicality of a law being unenforceable is not the same as making that thing legalized. The two issues are not identical or equivalent. \n\nThat is why Texas came out with new ways to try to enforce abortion laws that don't involve govt directly.\n\nThe real issue is addressing prevention which isn't the job of govt but the responsibility of individuals since sex and sexual relations are private. \n\nWhat I suggest is communities agreeing on their own policies similar to college campus policies that use consent forms which the residents agree to. \nWhat if people can agree that sex that results in unwanted pregnancy or abortion is a form of relationship abuse or sex abuse, and any  complaints of abuse would require both partners to undergo counseling until the complaint is resolved. At least both partners would be treated equally.\n\nCurrently only the women partners are held responsible and affected but not the male partners.\n\nSo this is discriminatory especially in cases where the males are more responsible than the females for the unwanted pregnancy in cases of coercion, abuse rape and trafficking. \n\nWe haven't even addressed that because people are too busy arguing over the symptoms of the problems instead of addressing the abuses causing them.\n\nThe true preventative work relies on people taking greater responsibility, not relying on govt to intervene in private matters and personal relations \n\nThe Veterans Party of America got it right when their platform used to say all abortion and social legislation  is unconstitutional.

There doesn\u2019t need to be a law explicitly saying gay marriage is lawful - just like there doesn\u2019t need to be a law saying a woman should have access to life-saving healthcare. These are basic rights.\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s job is to protect those rights, even when they aren\u2019t spelled out in legislation. In cases like Obergefell v. Hodges, it affirmed that marriage equality is a constitutional right.

I\u2019ve been begging him for time and to make me a priority because he\u2019s a workaholic among other things (non work related) that take up so much of his time. I asked for flowers, chocolates, surprises, anything to make up for the lack of quality time. He told me i didn\u2019t \u201crespect the grind\u201d and that he\u2019s doing this \u201cfor us\u201d. He wasn\u2019t hearing me or listening. It escalated. He called me a \u201cstupid bitch\u201d and i tried to push him out of my car. I mushed his face. \n\nI of course apologized because that was disgusting behavior on my part. \n\nNow I\u2019m at home, alone. Because he left. Idk where he has gone but we are going to officially split. I am now second guessing my decision. I haven\u2019t been single in so long. I don\u2019t even know how to be.

Most importantly, we owe it to ourselves and others who may not be completely lost. Of course, the people who fall in line with us are a given. What we do now affects us directly. As for those who are not completely lost, a lot of young women and women in general are indoctrinated and vote against their own self interest. The young ones can still be saved. Even the older ones can still be saved. It's not fair, and it really shouldn't be up to us. The one and only reason I know they can be saved is because I used to be among them.

I like that Harris hasn't been throwing it in our faces that she's a woman. The GOP have done that enough that it's refreshing to see Harris basically \"yeah, and?\" the whole thing. \n\nI truly 100% hope she wins tomorrow. Not just because she's a woman. But because she'll give hope to ALL women that their lives aren't something to be ruled over or even cast aside at the whims of others. It'll send a strong message to future leaders of our country that it doesn't matter if you're male or female, black or white, a parent or not, you CAN lead this country and you SHOULD if you have the best plan for fixing what's wrong. \n\nUnfortunately there are just way too many people clinging to the edifice of old that would rather die than admit defeat.

Then at least 15 minutes to figure out what the fuck they are doing with the app. Which means, the earliest door knock of a hypothetical volunteer (who we don't even know to exist yet) is 90 minutes before the polls close. And since voters will take at least 30 minutes to get to the polls because it's rush hour, they probably don't know where the fuck they are supposed to vote and they aren't waiting by the door with their shoes on, that means that at most, our hypothetical volunteer could knock on 10-12 hypothetical doors before it's too late. Wouldn't it be better, instead to give the volunteers that we do have tier 1 calling lists so they can make \\~75 real calls over the next 2.5 hours.\n\nThe answer I got was \"We don't have any tier one phone lists cut anyway.

I did however leave Facebook quite some time ago once it was shown they were radicalizing people for dollars, so I can't say anything about their current platform content.\n\n>It's either \"she's a cop\" because she was a DA, or else \"she's inexperienced, has done nothing, and has no plans\". Both sides conveniently forget to look at her term as a senator and her record there.\n\nAnd for some it's her time as Senator that is the problem, and for others its her prior campaigns and some questionable hiring choices, and so on. All you can do is try to meet people where they are, and work towards getting them to vote Kamala, but that's probably for a different post. \n\nAnecdotally, even people hesitant to vote for Kamala initially have actually been really excited at the prospect of a vote trade with friends and family in \"locked up\" states so they can express their dissatisfaction with the system in their third party vote in a state where it can be registered, but not doom the country in the process.\n\n>Anyway, my point is that I really don't think it'll be by a sizeable margin, if she wins. Very few people actually take a holistic look at the candidates in an election anymore, there's too much echo chamber social media rabbit hole nonsense going around, and very few people actually want to take the time to do any broader research.\n\nI'd love to say I disagree with you on the broader point, but at least at this point in time, you're right, vibes voters are everywhere. \n\nMy point was the number of people familiar with Kamala's baggage, whatever it would be for them, is much lower than Hillary; even setting aside the abject damage done by the attack on women's rights as the backdrop, I think many people are going to be surprised how improved a candidate who just doesn't have decades worth of pent up feelings about already performs.\n\nAt least in my leftist side of the divide, Biden stepping down was enough to earn the vote of many people otherwise reticent despite the obvious consequences, and many are just annoyed he didn't actually step down and allow her to take over prior to the election possibly enabling a possible primary challenger. \n\nBut hey, I'll take any win we can get.",

Republicans have done a great job convincing moderates that Democrats love having abortions.\n\n2.

I\u2019m pretty sensitive on my first day and everything felt like a personal attack\n\nYesterday I hung out with some friends who are fairly new, I\u2019m still trying to understand the dynamic. I spent all day over analyzing everything. I was completely wigged out \n\nMind you I\u2019m in the office and I\u2019m on the brink of tears every couple of minutes. I couldn\u2019t wait to get home \n\nThe second I walk through the door, my fianc\u00e9 is there ready to give me a hug. I didn\u2019t let him know the head space I was in prior. He\u2019s holding me and I ask for cuddles on the couch \n\nAll hell breaks loose, I\u2019m completely sobbing in his arms. Drenching his shirt completely. I\u2019m telling him everything that\u2019s been going on in my head the entire day, letting all the emotions I\u2019ve been holding onto release. \n\nHe works from home and after the break down, he takes out a freshly warm blanket from the dryer and tucks me in. He also puts on the YouTube video of adorable dancing fruit to regulate my emotions. And while im regulating he mentions grabbing some ramen after work as that\u2019s my favorite \n\nI really needed that sob and have calmed down but his kindness made me start crying again. I love this man \n\n",

He's already been locked up for almost two years, but his actual sentencing hearing wasn't until last month. We found out *on* the day of the hearing what the date of the hearing was. A bunch of us women rallied via group chat, and myself and one of the other women were able to knock off work last minute -- literally with only 90 minutes of notice -- to attend the hearing.\n\nI arrived at the courthouse a few minutes before she did. Once she arrived, we linked arms, and walked into the courtroom, only to discover that we were the *only* people there on behalf of the victim. Everyone else in attendance -- well over a dozen people -- were there on behalf of him. I was horrified. They even testified on his behalf, and spoke about his 'great character', and what a positive 'role model' he was for them. Some of them even asked the judge to consider \"all the good\" in him. \n\nMandatory minimum called for 15 years. Prosecution asked for 28 years. Judge sentenced him to 23 years.

She admitted she didn't have the courage to do it but she's slowly learning how to have a voice. I mentioned how hard it is; I'll post my thoughts on Facebook and then second guess myself and archive the post, because it **is** hard to be a woman and feel like you can voice your opinions. I let her know that, although we come from a long line of strong, opinionated women, they're still victims of generations of women being told that their place is in the home taking care of the kids and by having an opinion and being passionate about it is considered unladylike. Even if Harris does win, there is still a lot that we have to do as women to break these stereotypes and encourage young women to stand up and let their voices be heard. I never wanted to be the kind of woman that sits around and gossips about what other people are doing. I want to learn and read as much as possible so that the most powerful thing about me is my brain and my voice and I hope to keep encouraging young women to find their voice. ",

I'm not ready to die trying to bring a baby into this world, and my husband doesn't want to risk my life. I know the chances of death are slim, but they are not non-existent. I also have a health condition that raises the chances of preeclampsia, having a child small for gestational age, or having a stillborn. So I already have elevated risks of complications. \n\nAm I overreacting? Does anyone else feel similarly?  It's ridiculous that I feel like I have to base this personal decision around who is elected president, but it's the world we live in. Even in my blue state I wonder if my rights will be safe in a year. Since election day is tomorrow, this has been weighing heavily on me and I just needed a space to talk about it.",

         "It\u2019s a hard decision and talk. Hubs and I had this very discussion a while back, and we came to a slightly different conclusion but ultimately it\u2019s what ever makes you feel safe. \ud83d\udc95 it\u2019s a frustrating thing to even have to be put in the position to have this conversation too.",
         "You are definitely not overreacting. As a fellow woman who will likely face issues with childbirth due to various lifelong conditions that raise chances of complications and miscarriage. I 100% agree with you that if trump is elected that pregnancy will become way to dangerous in the United States. I mean because of him and the people he elected it is already too dangerous and there isn't an all out ban set everywhere yet. I mean an 18 year old girl recently died in Texas, she wasn't even looking for an abortion. She had recently had a gender reveal party. She just faced a miscarriage and complications but the doctors refused to help when she came in septic until they carried out TWO separate ultrasounds to make sure the fetus/baby was not viable/alive anymore.  And as such would not give her lifesaving treatment. Only after the two ultrasounds did they move her to icu where she died later. \n\nSo no, you are most definitely not overreacting. \nEven women in other countries have sworn to not travel to America if they are remotely suspecting they may be pregnant. Me included.\n\n(Edit to add the word not before overreacting in the last part of my comment)",
         "Unfortunately, not overreacting. I've lost five very wanted pregnancies and although we were lucky to not have complications, when there is an emergency, it happens fast. There is not time to get yourself across the border, unless you're lucky enough to live right next to it, and even then, that's a gamble. Thousands of birthing people will die under Trump every year if he is elected. Ultimately, I think that's their goal. Women who are scared, sick, and dying don't wield a lot of political power. Giving birth in the United States is already more dangerous than in most developed nations, and under Trump's abortion bans, no state will be safe. It's a very sad, infuriating, and just fucked up situation and I'm sorry you're needing to make decisions within it. Let's hope tomorrow brings some better news!",
         "I agree completely. Women are dying because their doctors are unable to care for them. I was a labor nurse for years and now am a postpartum nurse, and women\u2019s health is a huge passion of mine. I want children soon, and I want a daughter more than anything in the world, but I won\u2019t bring her into a world where her rights will be diminished because of her gender. I\u2019m getting up early tomorrow morning and voting in person for Harris in my \u201cthe future is female\u201d tee!",
         "I know 5 women who would under these laws would have died.  Malformed uterus/bleeding, ectopic, organ shut down, dead fetus. YOU ARE NOT OVER REACTING!",
         "You should be scared. I\u2019m scared. \u00a0\n\nI am currently recovering from a miscarriage. Like all my previous miscarriages, I hemorrhaged terribly and lost a shit ton of blood. When nurses and doctors are visibly freaked out by the amount of bleeding, that\u2019s when you know it\u2019s bad. \u00a0\n\nMy severe, life-threatening bleeding was slowed by a vacuum aspiration procedure. Essentially, the uterus keeps contracting as long as there is tissue in the uterus, which is bad if you are bleeding uncontrollably. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhat I had is considered an abortion procedure. The same procedure that is banned or very very hard to get in many US states. In fact, in many of these states I would have been denied care at the ER at all, even as I was bleeding out. I would have been told, as many women in similar positions have, to wait until my condition worsens. Sometimes, these women are actively miscarrying in their cars parked outside so they are close enough to get care when they are finally half-dead.\u00a0\n\nYou should be scared. We should all be scared. If Trump gets elected, considering my condition, I am not having any more babies for at least four more years because I could FUCKING DIE. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nLast bit: in some cases, I could have even faced criminal charges for having a miscarriage. There is no medical indication whether a miscarriage is random or intentional. None. They have no way of knowing. So just keep that in mind too.\u00a0",
         "I was 25 when Trump got elected in 2016. I\u2019d been on the fence about kids, but watching him get elected that night 100% solidified my decision not to have kids. I don\u2019t think people understand how bad the country is ALREADY fucked from his first presidency. Things are never going to be the same as they were pre-Trump, it can\u2019t bounce back. Like we can nominate Democrats for the next 50 years and I intend to vote for every one of them, but the Supreme Court isn\u2019t going anywhere and what the Republican party turned into, who they showed themselves to be, can not be reversed. \n\nSo I get it, because I felt that way in 2016 and I still feel that way, this is not a country I can ever feel good about bringing kids into.",
         "You are not overreacting. \n\nTrigger warning \u26a0\ufe0f \n\nI had a miscarriage of a planned and wanted pregnancy before Roe was overturned. I started to bleed out on my bathroom floor. My husband managed to get me to the hospital in around twenty minutes, and in that time my blood had soaked through a huge pad, two full size beach towels, and was pooling on the car floor and leather seat. I could feel myself getting colder and weaker with every heartbeat, and it was so scary to think my toddler could end up facing life without me. \n\nMy life was saved by an emergency D&C, aka an abortion. \n\nI\u2019ve had folks suggest that I could have simply driven to a state where abortion is legal, had this happened after Roe was overturned. I live over two hours from any other state, and I almost didn\u2019t survive the twenty minute race to the closest hospital. If I had needed to wait for paperwork and red tape, I would be dead. \n\nWhat is happening with women\u2019s healthcare in the United States is barbaric and inhumane. Many more women will die preventable deaths.",
         "You are not overreacting. I chose to get sterilized after Trump came into power (and later had a hysterectomy due to fibroids found during the process) because I fucking KNEW that this shit was coming. Protect yourself.",
         "You\u2019re not overreacting. I live in Texas. My husband and I are so lucky to have our daughter and we were thinking about another, but it has been put on hold because of our state\u2019s draconian laws and staggering maternal mortality rates. \n\nI have a responsibility to be here for my daughter and the risks are currently too high for us.",
         "I'm never planning to have children nor ever having sex yet the abortion ban still scares the shit out of me. What if someone forces himself on me at one point and now I'm pregnant and can't abort...\u00a0that's one of my greatest fears \ud83d\ude2d",
         "As a non-American I can only say what you are potentially facing in this election is truly horrifying.  You are absolutely not overreacting.\n\nPregnancy can and does kill women.  Access to appropriate healthcare is what saves their lives.  It\u2019s completely rational to not want to take the risk of pregnancy when there is a non-zero chance you could have complications for which you might be denied said life saving healthcare.\n\nI\u2019m hoping sanity rules in your country for the election.  Harris appears capable, competent and strong.  I hope that\u2019s as clear to the majority of voters in your country as it is to those of us on the outside looking in.",
         "I'm not saying this to scare you, but I am sharing this for women in this sub that were leaning towards voting Trump.\n\nTwo things are going to happen under him, and this is realistic, because it's already in progress judicially at state government levels. The Trump admin will use the Comstock act to ban the mailing of mifepristone in the United States but also from international locations; it would be illegal and seized. My state of Tennessee has been exploring avenues to ban mifepristone being sent in the mail, so this is a Republican initiative. \n\nTrump has talked about who he will appoint and he has plans to appoint someone that not only guts the FDA, but that could successfully make mifepristone illegal to be used for abortions. This would effectively make medical abortion unobtainable in every state. \n\nBetween these two routes, abortion will basically be illegal federally - without ever having had to sign a bill. So even though Trump said he wouldn't sign a bill, that doesn't matter and was likely never the goal.\n\nNo state will be safe and even if a state has abortion constitutionally enshrined, if mifepristone is illegal to be mailed or to be used for abortion, medical abortion will not be obtainable anywhere, only surgical abortion, which severely limits protected states to offer the procedure in a timely manner. This means women who should have had access to an abortion in the first trimester won't have it because of wait times at the very small amount of clinics that even still offer abortion.\n\nThis isn't even taking into consideration miscarriage care if fetal tissue is retained and there's no access to mifepristone. If abortion is not accessible, a retained miscarriage would result in sepsis. Sepsis leads to severe injury and death.\n\nI'm not fear mongering, I'm telling you in stark reality what the future will look like. Vote responsibily and accordingly.",
         "You aren\u2019t overreacting at all; this is a matter of life and death. If the rest of the US goes the way of Texas, your life will not be a priority if you\u2019re carrying a child.",
         "No you are not overreacting. I was 7 weeks pregnant when Roe fell and my state immediately implemented a trigger law from the 1800s before they voted to ban abortion almost entirely. I ended up having complications that put my pregnancy in the high risk category right when my state banned abortion. Thankfully I made it to 40 weeks and my son is healthy, but I cannot go through that stress again so he will not have a sibling.",

         "You're not overreacting.  My wife lost a child to miscarriage 20 years ago and she had to have a D & C in the hospital.  We lived in NY at the time, but we live in purple PA now and I wonder if it happened here during a second Trump presidency (vomited in my mouth writing that), would my wife be able to have the D & C or would she have to wait and possibly be on death's door before the doctors could do anything.  Or would she die from sepsis.  I worry now for my children and grandchildren.  It's such a scary time.  And I really can't believe that some people are so ignorant that they support his policies.  Or don't care enough.\n\nStay strong and encourage everyone you know to vote.  This is the only way we will make this nation safe for our children and grandchildren.",

My husband and I are wanting to try for a second child sometime next year, and I\u2019m terrified of any potential nationwide abortion bans being passed because I suffered from a ruptured ectopic pregnancy two years ago and now I\u2019m at an increased risk for another ectopic (about 10% chance). If Trump gets elected, I\u2019m thinking about trying for a baby sooner just so I can get through that risky period before an abortion ban could pass.\u00a0",

If that had happened now in a different state I might not be writing this now.",

We truly want to be parents and have a family, but if trump is elected we will not be having kids. I can\u2019t risk my health, my life. They don\u2019t care about me. My government would rather I bleed out and die than help me. And I simply cannot raise a child in this world knowing they will have less rights that I have now. \n\nIf trump wins, motherhood is no longer an option for me. My husband and I are voting BLUE in Pennsylvania tomorrow!!",
         "26F here- I'm already iffy about having kids, but it's an absolute no for me under any Republican government. I live in a red state and really can't risk it.\n\nMy main concern at this point is birth control access. I'm not sexually active, but my birth control is life-saving care due to my terrible hormonal mood swings and PMDD. It does more for my mental health than my other antidepressants, and without it, I don't think I'll make it.\n\nI don't think it's overreacting, as these are big health events and decisions that we don't have full control over because of our government. I'm recalling some conversation I saw online (so please call me out if this is misinformation!) that a Republican supermajority would be able to put through a national ban that would supersede a state's own laws. If abortions become illegal federally, it would become harder or impossible for blue states to remain safe havens for reproductive care.\n\nYour concerns are much more pressing because you're actively wanting to have children, and I'd fully agree with your decision to not have them under Trump. For my own personal life, I'm also terrified because abortion bans turn into other reproductive health bans. And if I can't get my birth control for hormonal therapy reasons, I'm toast.\n\nA Harris victory is a victory for reproductive care of all kinds. Here's hoping America shows up tomorrow.",

The link to the 200 page filing is in the article. For the nationalists, it's at least partially about 'replacement theory'. ( ie, not enough white babies and too many non-white babies) It's ugly stuff that they've been pushing for decades (also used as justification in mid-century Germany).\n\nIt's about punishing women.

A lot of the war on women has depended on republican-leaning voters saying they won\u2019t do things they tried to do (repeal the ACA) or did (Dobbs), or rationalizing that it won\u2019t affect them (thinking of that horror story with that woman in Texas who self-described as an abortion opponent).

When I tell you knowing what I know from the healthcare side, it\u2019s really wild how risky pregnancy is and that women aren\u2019t fully warned of this. Like abortion access or not, pregnancy is still extremely risky. It just becomes infinitely more dangerous if you restrict abortion. Honestly I think if women and girls knew just how dangerous pregnancy actually is, not nearly as many women would choose to start a family, and that\u2019s why nobody teaches us that in school or growing up.\n\nSo yeah, I don\u2019t blame you one bit for feeling that way.

There was no question about what had to be done.\n\nI'm 42 now and done having kids. Because I had an ectopic pregnancy before, I am much more likely to have another one than other women.\n\nIf Trump gets elected, I will go straight to my OBGYN and get a new IUD. And then pray I hit menopause in the next 7 years (that's how long IUDs last).

Even my father, who was once so proud and happy to achieve citizenship in the US, has pressured me to make sure my EU passport is up to date.

Neither can overrule the Supreme Court, which deemed it up to the states. \n\nJust some food for thought for this election cycle. You're not overreacting, and your feelings are valid.

You still have plenty of time before it\u2019s medically hazardous due to age complications. My advice to everyone who could potentially get pregnant is not to get pregnant unless they\u2019re completely sure they want to be pregnant and have a child.

For her, though, it's a huge deal. She has ALWAYS wanted to be a mom. She would be devastated if it never happened. So we've started trying despite the uncertainty of the future. We also live in a blue state where women can seek medical care and abortions.\n\nMy wife also travels for work fairly often; at least twice a month. One of the places she regularly has to travel to is Texas. I was browsing reddit the other day when a thought occurred to me.\n\nShould she get pregnant, there is a high chance she will have to travel to Texas during that time. There is a non-zero chance she could experience complications while in Texas. There is a non-zero chance those complications could be life-threatening. There is a non-zero chance she could be refused the medical care that she needs while in Texas. There is a non-zero chance either her, the baby, or both could die due to the complications and lack of medical care because she couldn't get out of that state in time. The chance is small, but the fact that it's a non-zero chance in the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA is repugnant.\n\nDoesn't matter that we're from a blue state. If something happens while she's there, Texas law is what matters.  If it were up to me, I would be doing exactly what you're doing: Waiting to see who gets elected and refusing to have children if it's Trump. However, we're a team and have to decide these things together.\n\nBut no, you are not overreacting.",

She had massive bleeding and nothing they did was making it slow down, they finally had to take her in for a D&C to stop it. She lived 5 minutes from the hospital and by the time they got there she had bled through a fresh pad and her clothes, blood dripping onto the floor as she walked into the ER where she abruptly passed out. \n\nSo no, you are not wrong in your assessment.

My literal only saving grace was that there was no heartbeat or even fetal pole remaining from my miscarriage. I had a teeny tiny bit of RPOC. Just tissue.\n\nPassed out when my blood pressure dropped suddenly, took an ambulance to the ER where I was quite literally pouring blood. Everyone was so kind to me. Except the OB. Prior to seeing her, I\u2019d been given a small dose of anxiety meds to keep calm and they frequently changed my sheets, gave me two transfusions. The ED attending said he\u2019d never seen so much blood from an internal source. Had to wait a couple of hours on the OB to show up, as this was quite early in the morning. No biggie, right? \n\nShe was a very mean, cruel person who offered me not one ounce of relief. She offered medical abortion. I told her that\u2019s not going to work, as I\u2019ve done that in the past and wound up back in the ER. Rolling her eyes at me, she asked if I really thought I needed sedation and the procedure. I told her yes. She ordered the ED stop any form of medication on me. Moved me to pre-op where I sat in limbo, in basically a closet, even when I began vomiting everywhere in pre-op from the pain and I was laying on blood soaked sheets for two hours while everyone on her team ignored every plea I had. She never checked on me. She didn\u2019t even write me an ibuprofen script. Her nurse avoided me. She quite literally didn\u2019t believe me when I said I had miscarried mostly at home, this wasn\u2019t my first time with this exact issue (it wasn\u2019t, either.) She DID accuse me of an incomplete at home abortion, treat me like dirt, and then cause more suffering. I wanted that baby.  \n\nThe last time this happened to me was pre Roe v. Wade and it was night and day. I was taken seriously. I was offered actual, quality care. I was discharged after being kept overnight for monitoring with a teddy bear, a heating pad, and a small script of anxiety meds and large dose ibuprofen. I was given a list of resources and told I should follow up with a therapist. Same state. Same hospital even. \n\nAnyone who says it\u2019s about state\u2019s rights to choose is correct. It\u2019s about a state\u2019s right to choose to attack women for merely existing. It\u2019s about emboldening misogyny, both outward and internalized. I will not become pregnant in this country again as long as I live.",
         "You're 100% right. I did have complications with my miscarriage, and my husband had to rush me to the hospital in the middle of the night. By the time we got there, I couldn't stand. I passed out before they were able to stabilize me. This all happened in less than a half hour from the start of the hemorrhage. If I hadn't been in an emergency room I could very well have bled out and died. If they had not been able to give me the drugs and do the cleaning out, due to bullshit bans on healthcare, I may have died. I'm grateful I got the care I did.

HOWEVER, this person said that was a false narrative that the GOP are pushing - it wasn't a blue wave on ELECTION NIGHT, but when the final results came in, it was.  People just didn't pay attention like we do in Presidential election years.  \n\nIt was all about that state's method of counting - they rediculously count the in person votes first - even though the mail in ballots could immediately be at least PREPPED before the election.  I believe mine are tabulated (I'm in a vote by mail state) but no one can see the results until 8 PM election night.\n\nWell, especially in 2020 and 2022, a LOT of Dems voted by mail - so essentially the in person votes skewed heavily to GOP.  I believe that is why a lot of people are doing in person early voting in key states.   In a couple of states they changed how they count (VBM isn't delayed)\n\nSo - when you consider THAT plus the fact that many are reporting that women would be nervous to answer a poll that they are voting for Harris because they don't want their husbands or fathers to know - places like Texas and Florida COULD BE IN PLAY.\n\nI am hoping for a Reagan - Mondale blowout, with the winner Harris.

I was given several different narcotic painkillers, including one just before the procedure, plus local anesthetic (needle in cervix is also extremely painful)-which is also way more pain medication than women are usually given for a vacuum abortion. My husband had to watch me writhe in pain while I squeezed his hand so hard. \u00a0\n\nI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m writing so much, but I just want this very real information out there. This isn\u2019t random rare stories, this is real life for so many of us.\u00a0",
         "As a 33 year old, literally the two most surreal feeling days (on like a wide scale level) of my life are 9/11 and the day after Trump got elected in 2016. The whole day I felt like I was in a fever dream. It didn\u2019t feel real.",
         "The only time I have ever said, *\u201dI told you so\u201d* was a few years after tRump got elected, and some of my family was baffled as to how he went off the rails. I pretty much stated that he has always been off the rails\u2026he\u2019s been bad news since before his political career. \n\nHow could anyone ever trust him to begin with? A slime ball all around. But he has an R by his name, so it was good enough for them! One of the only things that seems to get through to them is I\u2019ve told them if trump was running as a Democrat, I would not be voting for him on that side either. My personality isn\u2019t rooted from a political party.",
         "Yes, I cried for my kids who were still in elementary & middle school at the time. It's like everything I'd ever wanted for them was just slipping away. Then, we started looking at where else we could get citizenship to hedge our bets, especially for them (my husband & kids now have a dual citizenship - so we were successful with that). I'm in Texas, and I'm terrified of my daughter or my son's girlfriend getting pregnant. I keep Plan B around for them just in case.\n\nI am hopeful because I know their generation, and pretty much every generation past Gen X (I'm Gen X, at least we don't seem quite as brainwashed, but still very conservative and kind of prone to not analyzing enough sometimes) has different views. But, gah, we need people to vote (and yes, I know that it's hard sometimes - Texas throws all kinds of stuff in to make it hard, we have an ungodly early registration cutoff, you have to vote in the county you are a resident of which means a lot of college students can't, mail-in voting is only for 65 & up, etc).\n\nSorry, this turned into a mini-rant, but I am glad to see people like those on this thread.

ACA compliant insurance covers bilateral salpingectomy if the surgeon offers that. There\u2019s a list of doctors in the childfree Reddit for anyone interested.\u00a0\u00a0But of course this isn\u2019t a push to get a bilateral salpingectomy it is just a disclaimer for extra resources if anyone is interested.\u00a0",

They\u2019re predicting an OB shortage soon (to absolutely no one\u2019s surprise), which will only further the crisis. \n\nWe\u2019re fighting like hell, but it\u2019s an uphill battle against deliberate gerrymandering by state leadership and years of indoctrination in an underfunded, failing education system. \n\nUnfortunately, even with codification, I fear that healthcare for women in Texas will be set back for decades due to the flight of OBs. \n\nLeaving isn\u2019t an option for me right now\u2014and I *hate* the thought of it, to be honest.

It worked, we used them and all my friends knew I had them and would even like come to my house at night sometimes and knock on my window just for a condom which I mean is better than getting someone knocked up right? \n\nI did feel like I was corner store sometimes though because I lived on the corner and they would knock on my window and be like \"Aye, let me get a rubber and smoke\" like mf this is my *home* \n\n...Guess I went off on a tangent there myself haha.",

That's when they removed support of the ERA from their national platform.  They have been fighting the war against women for decades now.  Anyone who has voted for any Republicans since then has some responsibility for where we are now.   It's been very dismaying to see.",

He makes some really good cases about why voting for the lesser evil (if you see her that way) is the only way to keep fighting the good fight. If you hate Trump for any reason, whether it's because he's a rapist, or sparked a multi-front coup against democracy, or has multiple felony convictions, or because you believe in medical science, or don't want to die from survivable pregnancy complications, you need to vote for Harris, and nobody else.\n\nTo any of you who know women or allies that haven't already committed their vote to her, this is the time to help them see the light. You only get the power of one vote, but your power of personal influence can do so much more! The time to use it is now!",

         "It's hard to reconcile how right-leaning the political compass has skewed in this country. Kamala's policies are very much all over the place\u2014some of her policies are basic democrat policy, and some are very much republican. It's sad that we have reached a point where baseline, bottom-of-the-barrel democrat policies are seen as something to be given accolades when they should be a given\u2014a standard. I get it.\n\nBut I don't believe in this rhetoric of voting 3rd party out of protest due to the current democratic party also representing republican sentiment. Some think that if they vote 3rd party it will encourage a reform of democrat representation.\n\nThere is no reform coming. There is no revolution. If you throw away your vote to 3rd party, and think that 4 years of rightwing extremism is a worthy sacrifice to make for an imaginary reform, you're sorely mistaken. We have to shift the compass more \"true\" democrat by starting with what we have. If we allow this country to go even further rightwing, then progressive and left leaning ideology becomes more foreign and unacceptable.\n\nVoting for politicians is like riding a bus: it's rare that you take one single bus to reach your destination\u2014you take the first one to get closer to your goal, before getting onto another. You don't take a bus going in the complete opposite direction and expect anything good to come of it.",
         "The left eats itself, while the right will ride or die for their appointed savior. Whatever Trump does, the right will celebrate. Meanwhile, Harris\u2019s policies, views, career, history have been constantly put under a microscope. Of course, this is how it should be: we should be critical and always expect more from our elected officials. \n\nBut leftists need to stop expecting a perfect messiah. For one, the president alone doesn\u2019t enact change\u2014they can appoint officials who will push for change and do the necessary work. Second, politics is a difficult and dirty game; the layperson won\u2019t always know why a certain action was taken, or why something was or wasn\u2019t endorsed. We can only look at the person\u2019s career holistically and gauge their general political motivations.\n\nHarris gets a lot of flack for being a prosecutor, but I don\u2019t know why that\u2019s a bad thing. She\u2019s prosecuted murderers, drug cartels, rapists, sex traffickers. The truant bill is possibly a black mark on her record, but from what I\u2019ve read, she never intended for parents of truants to be arrested. Only like 7 out of thousands she prosecuted were convicted of marijuana possession, along with other crimes in tandem. And yes, being a prosecutor means that sometimes you have to push for sentences that seem harsh or extreme, but that\u2019s part of the job. That\u2019s why defense attorneys exist, to plead for the defendant. \n\nShe was also never \u201cthe border czar,\u201d I don\u2019t know why this keeps getting spread. She was sent to collect information and do field research essentially. Besides, one person cannot \u201csolve\u201d something big like a border crisis within a few months.\n\nI think people are missing the big picture. Which candidate is more likely to listen? Which candidate is more likely to consider the welfare of all groups, not just the elite few, even as they engage in the dirty work of politics? Who\u2019s more likely to push for ceasefire instead of just nuking entire populations out of existence? (And if you answer the orange buffoon to any of these, then you haven\u2019t been paying attention to the campaign at all.)\n\nI get that the bipartisan model limits us somehow, but honestly, with Trump as the only other choice, I don\u2019t see how any liberals can NOT vote for Harris.

She said even before the 2020 election was that her biggest fear would be to se Roe overturned in her lifetime - the passage of Roe happened in the middle of her career, so she knew first hand what it meant. \n\nFortunately/unfortunately she passed away before that actually happened, so she\u2019s been weighing heavily on my mind lately. I\u2019m glad she\u2019s not here to know what\u2019s happening, but I also know she would want her voice heard. \n\nAunt J, I will make you proud and I hope the rest of our country does too.",

People infringe on our rights - those that are enumerated and unenumerated - all the time. We have to fight those infringements with the tools of the system, as flawed as they are, or else our rights simply remain violated and we effectively didn't *have* that right to begin with (what is \"a right\" that can be violated without consequences or justice?)\n\nVoting on propositions, laws, ballot measures, and politicians with good progressive vision and values helps codify more of our unenumerated rights that are being attacked for any number of reasons. It makes it harder for regressive and reactionary judges to rule against us when those rights have been voted on and approved and codified, and of course it creates another board that reactionary politicians have to dismantle to infringe on our rights with legislation.",

The right wing fought to take it away. That's how power works. Rights are just a rhetorical label for something we've claimed is so important we have to fight to keep it. When the fight isn't good enough the right dissolves away.\n\nPeople are realizing that as Gen Z and Gen a get more cynical about the system and hopefully become more like the generations that gained the power to assert those rights.",

Here are some examples:\n\nYou have an inalienable right to property, the government will always have a duty to help protect your property to the extent that they can based on available resources.\n\nYou have the legal right to enjoy medicare or medicaid, which ever you qualify for, and the government has the duty to provide this service if you qualify. However, the government can change their laws to take away this right from you or terminate these programs. \n\nYou have the privilege to purchase your own health care.

      "text": "I asked my step dad who he's voting for this year, he said RFK Jr, lol. He doesn't want to vote for trump but \"doesn't trust Kamala at all because she's putting on an act and isn't who we think she is\". We obviously got into an argument about how all politicians have to \"put on an act\" to some degree and they've been doing that since the beginning of time but of course he doesn't trust her because she's a woman. \n\nI know he voted independent in 2020, but decided to ask him who he voted for in 2016 out of curiosity and he said he may have voted for trump, but doesn't remember. My mom looked shocked and said that he told her he voted for Hillary at the time and he looked pissed to be called out. He said who I vote for is my business and it's a private matter. I honestly felt shocked to see him exposed like that. I thought he always voted Democrat or Independent.\n\nSo I asked him what it was he trusted about Trump in 2016, since he's not trusting of Kamala I was truly curious how he could have trusted Trump. He said \"I liked that he was not a politician and I thought he would change our political system and economy for the better\". I said okay, but what was it about his character that you trusted? Like the video of him saying he 'can do whatever he wants, just start kissing women, grab em by the pussy', did that not deter him from thinking this guy is fit to protect and run our country? At first he tried to act like that was some fake news thing that was written about him and taken out of context, to which I reminded him it was an actual video/audio clip of Trump saying these things. Then he said \"well, it was a mistake then, everyone makes mistakes\". My heart dropped into my stomach. I couldn't believe he was actually excusing r*pe talk. He also said the comments Trump made about wanting to date Ivanka if she wasn't his daughter was also taken way out of context and \"that's just how a father compliments his daughters beauty\". I felt disgusted and just looked at him with shock and disgust, he started giggling and said \"you're burning little holes into me with your eyes right now\"- almost mocking and belittling my very justified anger. \n\nThis has all been very difficult for me to process. I thought I could trust this man. He has been in my life since I was 12 yrs old. I had a very rocky relationship with my biological father, and this man really was my father figure, my dad, the man I thought I could trust and feel protected by since I was 12. I'm just so hurt, disappointed, disgusted and angry. Idk where to direct this anger or what to do with it so I guess that's why I'm posting here, to vent. I was left by my bio dad and barely have a relationship with him, and this feels like losing my dad all over again. I feel like there is no man in my life I can fully trust and that angers me. I thought they were supposed to PROTECT us. ",

It's a matter of degrees. I'm certainly not showing off all aspects of my personality at work and I don't expect other professionals to do so, either. \n\nI lost so many male friends after the 2016 election after being completely surprised by how many just jumped on the Trump train and had absolutely no empathy for the women or anyone else in their lives who were scared and confused, and had no issues making jokes and laughing along with the misogynistic jokes and bullshit."
