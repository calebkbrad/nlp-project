It\u2019s amazing that people make any and all excuses for Trump and his behavior. There are never any true consequences to what he does and still amazes me each time. I am still stunned that AGAIN he will be in the White House come January.",

         "She was female and black/asian.  Of course she had to be twice as good to get half as far.  The postmortems are already ridiculous...I think the real truth is that Americans are naive, don't understand inflation and wanted \"change.\"  Clearly they paid no attention to who Trump is, but the idea of \"fixing things\" stuck somehow in their low-info brains.  That, combined with endemic racism and sexism is why Harris, who ran a great campaign, lost.  Also, do not discount the HUGE influence of unfettered billions spent god knows where to influence the end result.  Ground game becomes less important when you can infiltrate social media, podcasts, etc.  and flood the zone with propaganda.",
         "Everyone is looking for someone or something to blame. I think Kamala has among the least blame. She took on an insane challenge with 3 months time and all of the odds stacked against her. She executed extremely well. She just couldn\u2019t overcome the headwinds. That was out of her control.\n\nThere\u2019s lots to blame but I say it\u2019s time to bring back personal responsibility. Blame the voters. The ones who stayed home and the ones too stupid or lazy to have a basic understanding of the risk of a second trump term",
         "Honestly this shouldn\u2019t surprise any woman. Women have been held to a higher standard since day 1. If we men sleep around, it\u2019s cool. For women, you\u2019re considered a whore. You are constantly relied on to run a household and be head of a family (while holding down a job most of the time), but you can\u2019t be trusted to run a company or team, or be the president. The Scandinavian nations understand equality, but our macho \u2018Murica Christian Taliban attitude means women and minorities are always going to be at a disadvantage. Take people at face value, always. Don\u2019t ever make excuses for what they say. They wouldn\u2019t say it if they didn\u2019t believe it and plan on following through.",

They agree with everything people are saying about him; he\u2019s a pervert, a felon, a traitor, and they still voted straight red. They considered the fact that Kamala didn\u2019t win the primary to be outright disqualifying. Of course, Trump did try to overthrow the government, but they hold Republicans to a different standard. It\u2019s not rational, and that\u2019s the problem.\n\nThe Democratic platform is too dependent upon logic. Being politically and factually correct does NOT matter when lies are so much more comforting. The Republicans are projecting pure confidence in their plans, even if they collapse under scrutiny. We WILL end the wars. We WILL lower prices. We WILL bring back American manufacturing. That\u2019s what the Republicans are saying, and it is SO much more effective than the constant *maybe\u2019s* coming from the Democrats. The Dems need to go populist, get mean. We need ego, but not arrogance. People need to get hyped.",

She was unpopular as VP, didn\u2019t win a primary, and was part of the current administration. The pick isolated a lot of voters and as we can see by the voting demographics that went to Trump than many classes of people felt abandoned. The DNC needed to pick someone relatable, fresh, and new- far away from the Biden administration.\n\nEdit: she also made some really unpopular choices in California. Walz was honestly a better pick and was rated the highest among either ticket (Harris/walz and trump/vance).\n\nEdit 2: Dems also have to run on more than \u201cwe\u2019re better than the other guys\u201d. That\u2019s not a platform and doesn\u2019t appeal to moderates.",

They want to be able to pretend they gave the decision some thought, and came up with a reason that isn't \"I'm racist, and I really want to start deporting immigrants\" or something just as abhorrent.\n\nPeople keep saying values are subjective, but it's not in this case. Objectively, if you're looking for a good candidate, and the choice is \"felon vs non-felon\", the good candidate is the non-felon.

         "Yeah.... \n\nAll of these excuses are simply a way for them to quiet that internal voice that nitpicks and nags at them.

Wrong = bad. \n\nThey will keep on ignoring the evidence with distraction, cognative dissonance and willful ignorance until the ringing becomes too much. The only thing that will stop it is reality slapping them in the face. This election is a slap. Will they choose to look at the world or decide to let the ringing begin again? \n\nThat reality? Perhaps they were wrong. But if wrong = bad, when they are the hero of the story, when they don't have a moment to stop and think critically for a moment, they must continue the charade. Otherwise, they would have to accept they were part of the \" problem\". \n\nThe saddest thing is that being wrong is how we learn. When reality reaches out, when their mother/sister/wife/daugter or themselves are the next target of the 'Us vs. Them' fervor, they will again reach a point when the ringing becomes too much. They will have to choose to continue the self delusion or accept reality. \n\n\n>\"She just wasn't a good candidate\"\n\n\"**SHE**\" wasn't a good enough candidate *to them*. \n\nAnd all the excuses are simply self delusional justification of the misogyny and that our system is fucked.

Democrats are policy wonking in an age of populism. \n\nThe Democratic party is absolutely better for the economy... but the economy doesn't really serve the working class. The economy was great under Biden, but we all saw money work less for us, and work more for the wealthy. \n\nThat translated to \"Dems? Meh,\" for a lot of voters.\n\nAnd that isn't their fault. You can't individually blame all the 15M voters who didn't care to show up. That is not how systemic problems work.  \n\nThe Electorate is moving Left, but the party keeps going Right. This L was coming. It just came at the worst time. The Democratic party failed to align with the needs and inclinations of their base, so they failed.\n\nThis is Kamala's fault, and Biden's, but more than anyone, it's the DNC's fault, with their hundreds of billionaire-bought soulless advisors taking money to ensure the policies continue to favor the rich. \n\nSo what it amounts to is we have two parties paying the game the same way, but the GOP was always better at being corrupt. The Democratic party never answered the call of the voter who hated the corruption and wanted policies more to the Left. The Democrats abandoned Medicare for All. They abandoned progressive tax policy. \n\nPut the blame where it lies. This is a party failure. \n\nIf we have elections again, and if the Democrats move Left and start to put people like Bernie and AOC and Tim Walz out front, maybe they will do better. \n\nBut I doubt our institutions hold. The Right was losing power every cycle. They won't let it go willingly. The time will come when they falter, though. Fascists can't endure long in places with a strong democratic tradition.",

She was too timid, she hoped that she could just appease everyone and slide in, somehow. I'm sorry but that's not how politics work.",
         "Yes she was an objectively much better candidate than Donald Trump but American politics isn't about which one is better, it's about which side turns out. \n\nKamala Harris has never been an exciting candidate who turns out voters. If she were, she would have been able to compete in primaries but she couldn't even make it to Iowa. Being Biden's VP was the closest her politicking ever got her to actually winning the presidency. Harris could not out-campaign Joe Biden in 2019 and unfortunately she didn't have a lot of opportunity to build her standing and set up a presidential run as VP. She was utterly kneecapped in this race by Joe hanging on with rigor mortis, and didn't have the time to establish her policy goals in the memory of the electorate. Yes she has policies articulated that were good but that is not how her campaign was defined in the eyes of the uneducated and ignorant.\n\nYes she undoubtedly deserves to win much much more than Trump. She is not a fascist dictator wannabe studding her cabinet with Heritage Foundation and Musk. But unfortunately in the US of A that's not what wins you the presidency, you have to win the monkey popularity contest",

She didn\u2019t run on a platform that motivated those people to vote and she was the least liked candidate when she ran in the primary.   Warren would have been better IMO",

         "There was an opinion article by Ken Dryden (a very famous hockey player from the 1970s, who went on to pursue law and became a Liberal Member of Parliament in Canada, who has more recently written some very good books) in the news last weekend here in Canada, that I feel explains it pretty well. The article was about character, how you play the game, whether America cares anymore or not. \n\n[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-it-does-matter-if-you-win-or-lose-the-question-in-america-is-whether/](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-it-does-matter-if-you-win-or-lose-the-question-in-america-is-whether/)\n\n*This election is not about issues. It\u2019s not even about personalities or character. It\u2019s about world views, about understandings of humanity, about the big picture in its biggest sense. And on these, the people have made up their minds.*\n\n*To his supporters, Donald Trump is the tough guy. The realist: This is the way the world is. This is the way it works, in your neighbourhood and workplace, and mine. Inside our borders, and outside. This is about punching the other guy in the nose before he punches you. Eating or being eaten. Who do you want in that Oval Office? Who do you want in that foxhole next to you? This isn\u2019t about being a nice guy, a guy you\u2019d want your kid to be. This is about being strong, tough, respected, feared. This is the United States, the greatest country on Earth. This is about winning. Don\u2019t be a sucker. A sap. A loser. In your neighbourhood, your workplace, in this world, who gives you the best chance to win? Against China and Xi Jinping? Russia and Vladimir Putin? Against tinpot dictators and terrorists everywhere? That\u2019s the question, the only question. And the only answer: me. My words, my exaggerations, my lies, my outrageous claims, they don\u2019t matter. Details, specifics, what\u2019s true, who cares? I speak truths. People get it. It\u2019s the message, the whole message, that matters. And I am the message, and my message is straight-between-the-eyes clear. This is the real world. Fear against joy? Are you kidding? You can\u2019t trust joy. Fear wins every time. Hands down.*\n\n*To her supporters, Kamala Harris is the determined optimist: This may be the way the world is, inside and outside our borders, the way your neighbourhood and workplace are, but it doesn\u2019t need to be this way. This isn\u2019t about being a nice guy, but, in part, it might just be about who you want your kid to be. What you want your country to be. Yes, this is about being strong, tough, respected and feared. And yes, this is the United States, so this is about winning. But it\u2019s also about how we win. Against China and Mr. Xi, against Russia and Mr. Putin, against tinpot dictators and terrorists everywhere. This is about America.*\n\n*Two visions. Two embodiments. This is where we are. This is not so much a presidential vote as a referendum on a country\u2019s psyche and soul. To see how wide the divide really is. Is America possible in this world? Does how we win matter any more?*",

Her \"most lethal military in the world\" and \"yay fracking\" rhetoric combined with her unwillingness to actually commit to implementing policies to end the genocide in Gaza and address the climate emergency alienated a huge proportion of the democratic base. \n\nThere's no denying that misogyny and racism played a part in her losing the election, but Harris screwed herself over by a) accepting the candidacy instead of doing actual primaries (not exactly a democratic decision), b) appealing to the right at the expense of the left and c) basing her campaign around \"saving democracy\" (something the electorate doesn't respond to, not to mention point a) instead of actually improving the average American's life (sure her tax policy was nice, but she made a huge mistake spending so much time talking about America's economic recovery without addressing the fact that while the economy overall was doing great, the average lower and lower-middle class American was struggling). She's not blameless. \n\nShe basically ran her campaign solely on abortion rights knowing full well that American men don't care about it. She should have built a better relationship with the democratic base, and she didn't, and now we're royally fucked.",

After having a viral moment in the 2016 campaign her polling quickly brought her back down to where she was at 5%.  People really did not like her and did not want to vote for her.  Most votes weren't voting for her, they were voting against Trump.  That's why the turnout was so low.  Qualifications really mean NOTHING AT ALL when it comes to Americans electing a President.  Of course there's misogyny and racism there as well.  She also only had a few months to campaign and get people to know and support her which absolutely crippled her.  But she also wasn't a good candidate because people didn't like her, plain and simple.\n\nIn MadMen Pete Campbell summarized Nixon going against Kennedy as Kennedy being \"Elvis...that's what we're up against.\"  He's a cult of personality.",

Like even when the bar for him is the absolute lowest it can go, she\u2019s still somehow below that by default. At this point, I think Biden might have faired better, and that says a lot about how ignorant, racist, and misogynistic the people of this country are.",
         "When they say \"She just wasn't a good candidate,\" they are commenting on her race and gender. Nothing more. They can't say it's her policy, because Trump literally has none.

I am so tired of reading all of these intellectual takes on why Kamala failed and \"wasn't good enough\" or why the Democrats \"didn't have any policies voters are interested in\" or whatever the shit.\n\nNo, the only reason Trump won is because the majority of people are apparently either christo-fascists (and insane) or \"just\" insane, and absolutely fucked in the head.",

We have to face there much more ugliness in this nation than we may have realized and it's always been that way. \n\nI mean we've had to fight tooth and nail for scraps of basic rights, and now we're going backwards fast. It was never great and we need to face the fact that American exceptionalism and even the American dream never existed but for a select few. \nWe are an ugly, hateful, racist, sexist, spiteful and greedy nation.

         "It's the economy. Those conservative and independent voters who went out to Trump didn't watch all his speeches or pay attention to his rambling and racist rhetoric. Yea his base loved every minute of it, but even most voters - particularly swing voters - just aren't plugged into mainstream political news or ongoings. \n\nWhy did they vote for Trump? Rampant inequality and the cost of living is still squeezing the working class. The inflation was far more Trump's fault than anything else, but again, *these people don't understand politics or economics with that level of complexity.* \n\nSo they still feel left behind, and they have economic concerns. Aggregate classical measures of the economy are biased towards the rich, measuring high-water marks and ignoring the human pain at the lower ends of all of the numbers. And Republican feaux-populism addresses those fears - even if stupidly and dishonestly. \n\nHarris never appealed to voters strongly and clearly enough on this issue. Those people want either snappy slogans that they can cling to, or clear and bold promises. Harris didn't do either. I remember her talking about small business loans (most people aren't entrepreneurs, so the vague promise of \"more jobs\" through that just isn't landing with people) and some mention of the CHIPs act (too nebulous for most people, and not appealing to every industry) as well as her touting Biden's nice \"soft landing\" on inflation. I don't remember anything else sticking. I may have missed something, but I'm as plugged in as anyone can be and was out knocking doors and I don't know what else she was promising on the economy. At the time I was okay with it because I thought everyone else thought Trump was awful and the hope of a young candidate was exciting and a little blinding. \n\nDems have abandoned the labor class, and in doing so have also effectively alienated white and Latino men - and even kept lots of white women away!\n\nWe don't have to appeal to masculinity directly to win more of that demographic, but we *do* have to understand their anxieties and fears. And it's the economy. \n\nAnd don't get me wrong. There is real hatred and sexism and racism out there as well. But Harris didn't even get all of Biden's voters back out in 2024, much less convince the Swing voters. That's a bad campaign.",

Remember in 2020 dem primaries when she got almost no votes? People wanted policies like Medicare for all, universal basic income, etc.She never talked about any of that, and barely touched on climate change. In hindsight, I don\u2019t think it was fair for so many to sit the election out, but I can kind of understand why it happened. We have got to start hyping up better candidates that WE choose.\n\nThat being said\u2026 it\u2019s fucking sad that the prospect of many women dying wasn\u2019t enough to keep that orange turd out of office. I will never stop fighting against the patriarchy.",
         "She was held to a higher standard because the DNC and media decided to. I voted for her but let\u2019s talk about why: \n\n1) she was a distant last place in the primaries in 2020. This isn\u2019t a Bernie situation where he was forced out by the DNC for Clinton. The people did not like her and she got something like less than 4% of the support. \n\n2) Joe waited too long to drop out. The dems could have then had primaries. Had he done so, he would have been remembered as an American hero. Now he\u2019ll be known as a stubborn old fool. \n\n3) Americans do not feel the good economy. All they\u2019re hearing about is record high profits and the 401ks while they struggle to feed their families and buy a house. They don\u2019t care what some person who studies economics tells them because they do not experience a correlation. This will almost always result to flipping the incumbent. With as wild as trump is, he knows how to put his finger on the pulse and hammer what makes people worried. \n\n4) You cannot win a race based on \u201cI\u2019m not my opponent.\u201d The average American probably didn\u2019t watch most of her interviews and maybe only watched the debate. Hell there was a significant portion who thought Biden was running again. During the debate, she did not address what she would specifically do to help people feed their families. Tbf she was kind of on a tightrope. You don\u2019t really want to go against your administration, but you also can\u2019t admit what you\u2019re doing now isn\u2019t working for the average person. \n\n5) As seen a million times throughout this country\u2019s history, the USA does not give a flying fuck about social issues when there is a perception that their cost of living is rising. As in 3, it\u2019s always going to kick the incumbent out of office. This is unfortunately the reality of America whether you like it or not. The country doesn\u2019t give a fuck. \n\n6) education is fucking awful here and people cannot critically think. For whatever reason, humanity has this pattern of ignoring their frontal lobe and make decisions based on the reptilian brain. \n\n7) I will admit this surprised me, but she could not mobilize voters. As always, the DNC catered to the centrist or moderate republicans, and again, it blew up in their face. There was so much progressive energy in the beginning and then she started campaigning with fucking Darth Vader\u2019s daughter. These moderate republicans won\u2019t vote for you. They\u2019ll leave the ticket blank or they\u2019ll stay home. The DNC technocrat billionaires don\u2019t care because they\u2019re rich and they win either way, so they hamstring progressive politicians to keep their taxes low. \n\nThese are my own personal observations",

It is all a ruse to keep shifting things farther right and farther right.\n\nWe see it each time. The dems lose, and the \"moderates\" start whining, \"well, if only you guys weren't soo mean and extreme, then I would have voted dem but, alas, I had no choice but to vote for the rapist fascist.\" They are doing this right now, ffs. Even though Kamala is already center right and spent her whole campaign catering to these losers while abandoning the needs of the working class. Now, look where it got her?\n\nBernie Sanders got it right in his statement. We need a candidate who actually listens to the needs of the working class rather than the same faces doing the same thing over and over and being all surprised when it doesn't work. Start platforming actual progressive policies that help us, like Medicare for all, paid family leave, GND, codify abortion rights, etc and then see. Most other developed countries have had these for years. It is 2024, get with the program.",

Speakers like Obama can take the same stump speech and make it sound fresh each time he delivers it. That's just a skill that he has - one of the best orators of all time.\nHarris always said the same lines the same way in the same order. She got a little better as she went on, but speech-giving was not her best ability.\n\nThat, of course, doesn't at all affect how she would perform as a president, but I think it DID feed into the narrative that \"she can only read off a teleprompter.\"\n\n(Of course, as I'm thinking it now, they said the same thing about Obama and the teleprompter, which is ludicrous. Probably just the racist trope that black people are too dumb to do anything but read what some white person wrote for them. Ugh.)",

I'd say so.  Was it amazing?  I wouldn't say that.  Was she held to a higher standard than Trump?  Certainly.

She could have played into that similar to how Obama did, targeting far more progressive demographs, but she ultimately did not.

That sounds crazy to voters, who are struggling to buy groceries. \n\nMeanwhile we heard that Black men wouldn't vote for her because she's a woman. And Black. But 80% of them voted for her.\n\nExit polls shows that 49% of Trump voters said their #1 issue was the economy. The economy is a today problem, a this-week problem, a this-month problem. 58% of Harris voters (!) said their #1 issue was \"state of democracy.\" That's too vague and abstract for most voters. That's a maybe-next-decade problem to most voters. Only 12% of them said their #1 issue was the economy.\n\n49% versus 12% (#1 issue being the economy) is huge. People whose #2 issue was the economy were more than *four times* more likely to vote for Trump.\n\nShe was doing really well over the summer on that topic, and then inexplicably (to me at least) shifted away from the #1 topic on most voters' minds.\n\nI absolutely believe that if her whole campaign had been economy, economy, economy and economic justice that she would have (probably) won.

      "title": "Asked the guy I was dating about abortion and he showed me his true colors ",
      "text": "I (20F) had been dating this guy (24M) for about one month when we had a conversation about abortion. We hadn't had sex before because I had an iffy feeling about him but I couldn't say why so I didn't even let him kiss me or anything. \n\nBy the way I live in an European country where you can abort up to 12 weeks and don't really face any problems regarding that besides maybe the high price for the abortion. \n\nIt's always been a sensitive topic for me, even though I consider myself a rational person. In past relationships, I\u2019ve brought it up early to see where the guy stands, and both of my exes gave what I considered the perfect response: \"I don't have an opinion, it's the woman's choice, and I\u2019ll support whatever she decides.\" So when I asked this guy about it, I was not expecting his answer. I mean I kind of did since he always claims to be traditional, which he isn't exactly since he smokes, drinks a lot and talks about sex a lot even though I told him it makes me uncomfortable. \n\nHe told me, \"I wouldn't love the woman anymore if she got an abortion and killed our child. I'd be too sad to know she killed our love. I would leave her.\" \n\nI was honestly shocked. First of all, \"killed\" isn\u2019t the right term, and second of all - what? He quickly tried to backpedal, adding things like, \"It\u2019s okay if the woman's life is in danger\" and \"No, I wouldn\u2019t leave you.\" But he kept justifying his position by bringing up his faith, which felt especially disrespectful. Until now, he barely mentioned his religion, but suddenly it was the reason behind his opinion. \n\nWhat really upset me, though, was when he said, \"Women nowadays go to clubs, sleep around, and then get abortions. They kill children. It shouldn\u2019t be normalized. Most women are whores. They treat abortion like it\u2019s going to McDonald's.\" This was just disgusting. I told him how dangerous and hurtful those kinds of generalizations are, especially considering how many women in the US are suffering because of abortion bans. I think it's heartbreaking that men who don\u2019t understand the reality of women\u2019s health and autonomy think they should have a say in something so personal.\n\nHe got angry and tried to deflect, saying, \"You always act all traditional and arrogant, but you sent me a picture of your boobs.\" To clarify, it was a bikini pic, just showing him that my top didn\u2019t fit properly since we were talking about women's sizing including bras and it wasn\u2019t sexual. Also, he had pictures in his Instagram highlights where his female friends were wearing bikinis. But he used that as a way to shame me, which was infuriating. He was always the one bringing up sexual questions, even when I told him it made me uncomfortable, and yet he tried to play the \"traditional\" card.\n\nAfter that, I was done. I told him I never wanted to hear from him again because his views were harmful and disrespectful. That was a couple of days ago and he\u2019s been spamming my phone every day, begging for another chance, telling me I\u2019m his \"dream wife,\" (probably because he is into my looks and me wanting to be a tradwife) and even saying he\u2019d change his views for me. \n\nI can\u2019t be with someone like that. Not only do I disagree with his stance, but it also breaks my heart to see how many women, especially in places like the US, are suffering because of abortion bans. I read everyday the articles and I pray for the women in the US. This is now a deeply personal issue for me, and I can\u2019t be with a man who doesn\u2019t respect a woman\u2019s right to choose.\n\nExtra: He also mentioned how he had rejected girls because they already took of their clothes by the second date. He let them feel comfortable enough to do that, so he isn't in a position to shame anyone. Also, he tried to kiss and hold my hands on the first few dates a couple of times and I didn't let him so huh, who is the problem. Also, in my last relationships I already had sex or kissed them by the third date because I don't care about how long we are dating - when I trust you then I trust you. It doesn't matter how early or late a woman decides to have sex and it doesn't determinate her worth. \n",

         "Every woman I've known who's had an abortion has been haunted by it. Every. Woman. But their lives and/or health would have been destroyed if they continued the pregnancy - and as a generalisation for most of their situations - they had ended up pregnant by crappy partners who would be unwilling and awful fathers. \n\nThe most heartbreaking one was a woman who was unwittingly pregnant when given a certain life-saving medication, which would have 100% led to terrible birth defects. She would have loved another child, but it would have destroyed her family having to prove 24/7 care for a child with extreme needs, if she even survived the pregnancy, which was definitely a huge question mark after two traumatic C-sections and tons of scar tissue. And so, heartbreaking decision, but necessary. \n\nThat's the reality. An abortion is not like buying fast food, JFC. It's an emergency procedure and it's rare to have one. It's not easy, it's not nice, but it's necessary. \n\nAnd if there was some living parody of a \"nasty woman\" who was getting an abortion every weekend, then why isn't she being given the option of sterilisation? And what about the man/men getting her pregnant? Why aren't they being hunted down with the same fury? Why isn't there a global campaign to stop men impregnating all these women? Why is it all on women? It takes two to tango. \n\nThe whole argument absolutely stinks when you point out why men aren't being held accountable for all these wild pregnancies. It's then you cannot deny the misogyny. It's the woman's fault, every time.

Bejerot's observations were based on a limited set of circumstances and focused primarily on the emotional responses of the victims (primarily women) without deeply considering the broader context of power dynamics and coercive relationships.\n\n\n>He attributed the hostages' behavior to emotional bonding without adequately exploring factors such as fear, manipulation, and the threat to life that characterize hostage situations. This is a misunderstanding of how victims respond to trauma, particularly in abusive relationships.\u00a0\n\n\n>By framing the emotional attachment of hostages to their captors as a syndrome, Bejerot pathologized and oversimplified the behavior of victims, particularly women.\u00a0\n\n\n>Stockholm Syndrome has been perpetuated as something that only affects women. It suggests that women are more likely to submit to or romanticize abusive situations, reinforcing traditional gender roles that view women as the nurturing and vulnerable ones.\u00a0\n\n\n>It's also often romanticized, framing it as a love story rather than a psychological response to trauma.\u00a0\n\n\n>This perspective obscures the realities of coercion and manipulation that characterize abusive relationships, further perpetuating the idea that women are incapable of self-determination.",

Harris had a 6 percentage point advantage. Hillary had 18, Biden 25. Young people shifted to Trump.\n\n* Young women. Harris won then by 12 points, Biden won them by 24, twice the gap in 2020 vs. 2024.\n\n* Women in general. Trump won 42% of the women's vote in 2016, then 43% in 2020, increasing it again to 45% in 2024.\n\n* White women. They have only voted for the Democrat twice, in 1964 for Johnson and 1996 for Bill Clinton. Trump captured 52% of their vote. (Higher than that for older white women.)\n\n* White men. Trump won white men by 20 points, which is massive. However, he won white men by 24 points in 2020, so he lost some white male support. \n\n* Black men. Harris won 80% of Black men, when this whole election we were told black men wouldn't vote for her, and that they were [intellectually deficient](https://x.com/kbyrd2_/status/1853883382998204681?s=46) because of that.\n\n* Black women. Harris won 93% of their vote.\n\n* Trump has (somehow) diversified the GOP in ways the Democrats took for granted. The Harris vote was much less diverse (by half) than the Biden vote in 2020.\n\n\n\n* Hispanic women. Clinton won them by 44 points, Harris won them by 24 points. That's a massive shift of 20 points. \n\n* Hispanic men. In 2016, Clinton won Latino men by 31 points. In 2020, Biden won them by 23 points. In 2024, Trump won then by 10 points. That's a shift of 41 and 33 points. That's not just a slice of voters, that's a wholesale reversal. \n\n\nThe DNC basically has blood on its hands for how horribly it misjudged this electorate and how badly it has run its elections.\n\n> The Harris campaign tried, with good reason, to convince white women that their future was at stake. Trump is all but guaranteed to oversee a further rollback in reproductive rights, and the president-elect has also openly flirted with a federal ban on abortion. \n\n>And yet that was not a winning message for white women, at 52%. A recent Times/Siena showed that the majority of white women, like their white male counterparts, saw inflation and the economy as their top voting issue. Abortion was second, and immigration was third. To be sure, there is a notable age split here: Gen Z women only went 36 percent for Trump, women aged 30 to 44 went 41 percent for Trump, women aged 45 to 64 went 48 percent for Trump, and women over 65 backed the former president 45 percent.",

They all use behaviourism to control a vulnerable population (children) who grow up to be voting adults.\n\nIn terms of direct election results, foreign influence propaganda is not an insignificant effect. No one is above it and no one can critically think their way out of being influenced by propaganda. Personally, I think it is a pointless exercise in trying to blame these women. I think efforts need to move towards breaking down systems of propaganda and oppression and manipulation of children. \n\nIt seems the education divide is well correlated with the election results, except for black women who sent that rapist a message.

The way that algorithms on social media sites are trained to identify people who are of demographics most likely to be undecided, and then pump their feed full of rightwing outright lies is utterly horrifying.

      "title": "It\u2019s time for divorce. ",
      "text": "If you live in a red state and have been considering divorce, you need to get out now. You need to file now. The last state to enact no fault divorce was in 2010. 2010. If they can overturn Roe v. Wade, which was precedent for 50+ years, they can over turn no fault divorce. And this is one of the key signatures of the 2025 project. File now. Make a plan now. Get out now. Please leave so you\u2019re not stuck having to prove infidelity or abuse. That can be really hard to do, especially with judges who don\u2019t like women. \n\nEdit 1: I\u2019ve seen several folks asking what a \u201cno fault\u201d divorce is. I\u2019m not a lawyer, but I\u2019ll roughly explain.\n\nFirst, for those of you not in the US, you have to remember that each state has its own laws regarding marriage. The federal government does not currently define marriage, but under rulings by the US Supreme Court, the federal government can force the states to include some definitions that others don\u2019t for example Loving vs. Virginia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loving_v._Virginia), which forced states to allow interracial marriage. More recently, some states had allowed same sex marriage, but Obergefell v. Hodges (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obergefell_v._Hodges) forced all states to allow same sex marriage by saying it was a right for all citizens to marry, even if it was to someone of the same sex. \n\nSo each state has marriage laws. All states now have \u201cno fault\u201d divorce, which means that either person in a marriage can file for divorce against the other person without a reason and the court has to grant it. In past years, many states required that you prove one of three things to be able to divorce - infidelity or violence/abuse or substance abuse. Many conservative men (including our soon to be VP, JD Vance) want to end no fault divorce, so you could only get out if you prove, in a court of law, that one of those three things is true. Here is a CNN article that explain why requiring someone to be at fault (https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/27/us/no-fault-divorce-explained-history-wellness-cec/index.html) \n\nHere is a quote: \u201cBefore no-fault divorce, a woman in the US who was in an abusive or exploitative marriage didn\u2019t have many options. Husbands typically controlled a family\u2019s finances, and the social stigma for seeking divorce \u2014 not to mention the difficult process of having to prove \u201cfault\u201d \u2014 was a major deterrent. These problems got more complicated if a husband didn\u2019t want a divorce.\u201d\n\nIn the US, 70% of divorces are filed by women (https://www.whitleylawfirmpc.com/3-reasons-why-women-initiate-divorce-more-often-than-men/) and you only have to read through this sub to know why. Conservatives want to stop women from ending this marriages and they have plans to do it. \n\nEdit 2: I\u2019ve seen a couple comments about my circumstances, specifically. You can go back through my comment history or post history. I\u2019m not married. I was married for about 15 years (with two kids). We separated in 2021 and divorced in 2023. I would have been able to get divorced with a fault divorce because my ex cheated, but I spent $4000 on a lawyer (as did he) because things become somewhat contentious around the splitting of assets and child support. We did not say why we were divorcing in the paperwork. It was a no fault divorce and it still cost me $4000 and we never went to trial (and annoyingly, we came to an agreement outside of our lawyers because his lawyer was delaying things and he wanted to get remarried). So imagine what it would cost a woman trying to escape an abusive marriage from a spouse who does not want them to end the marriage.

         "I have two family stories to tell, and they're basically the good side and the bad of women and their experiences back in the day.\n\nMy Granny (great grandmother, born 1888, died 1983) was a strong as hell lady. She was a farmer, owned her land, voted in every election from 1920 until she died. She was widowed in 1928, with 5 daughters under age 10. The woman worked. She sent all of her daughters through high school during the great depression, even when that required paying for their room and board in town. Granny wasn't a cuddly woman, but she bleeping loved all of us kids, and lived a humble and quietly generous life.\n\nAfter my grandmother (Granny's youngest daughter) graduated from high school in 1942, Granny remarried. I don't know whether there was a great romance or something. I do know that (per family lore,) the second husband wasn't the kind of worker Granny was. Apparently, the divorce happened after Granny had been in the field all morning, went to take a break after the mail ran, and got upset because her then husband had just risen and picked up her (weekly rural) newspaper from the table in the front room. Granny told the man that it was her paper, she paid for it, and she'd read it first, thankyouverymuch. He got his galluses in a bind and declared that he'd go buy his own paper.\n\nWhen he got back from the nearest store (at least 5 miles of dirt road each way,) all of his worldly goods were in the ditch across the road, and Granny was sitting on her front porch, with a shotgun laying across her lap, reading her newspaper. \n\nMuch darker: I had a relative by marriage who didn't talk about it much, but apparently grew up with a horrifically abusive father. According to all the stories I heard, from multiple sources that seem reliable, the in-law's mother took the worst, because she tried to protect her children. There were few resources for a victim of domestic violence in that time and place.\n\nAfter the youngest child established his own separate home, the abused wife committed a murder-suicide. She apparently gut-shot her husband, watched him suffer and die, and then cleanly shot herself. The children had a funeral for her. They never claimed his body.",

      "text": "I recently divorced my ex. I always thought we were star crossed lovers who made it happen. \n\nWhen we met he was dating a girl. Our connection was immediate, and I was young. He convinced me that his girlfriend was extremely abusive to him. I'll keep this short and just tell you all I hated this woman from the bottom of my heart for what she \"did\" to him. So I justified how he left her - he moved out with the promise that it was only because he had gotten a great job and he'd be sending her money until they got back on their feet. I thought this was for his safety and I supported it.\n\nAnd then he did the same to me. We were married for 10 years. Our relationship started shortly after he \"got out\". I thought things were great but apparently that was just me. His reddit account is dripping in thirst posts on the mutual masturbation subreddits. I didn't know this til later. \n\nHe stopped coming home to our marital home. He told me it's because we had money problems and he had found a 2nd job right next to his current one but he \"couldn't spare the critical sleep time\" for the commute home. Of course there's more to it but I finally had enough after nearly 3 years. \n\nColor me absolutely flabbergasted when he hired a semi fancy \"men's rights\" lawyer and his divorce complaint was packed full of accusations of abuse against me. \n\nColor me fooled when he submitted his financial reports to divide assets that he had a joint account with another woman. Her tax returns were included in the package. A woman half my age who very likely hates my guts for what I \"did\" to my ex. And though I wish I could tell her the truth, I hold no ill will. She probably thinks she's doing the right thing, too. Helping an abuse victim. \n\nIf a woman says 2+2 = 5 SHE RIGHT AND I WILL FIGHT FOR HER.",

In the last one, I made it clear it was all on me. She's been open about having struggles with and being deeply hurt by women in the past.

         "I had a long term boyfriend years back that this sort of reminds me of. \n\nI was 17 when we met and he was a few years older. We worked at the same restaurant and originally he was flirting with a girl at the restaurant next door. She'd come over to see him and they'd hang out. Then suddenly he wasn't into her anymore and told everyone at work that he'd ended things. Then he told us she wasn't accepting the break up and was \"obsessed\" with him. She stopped in a few more times and we'd all shoot her weird looks and giggle about her. He told me they hadn't slept together and weren't serious, but a coworker he was close with accidentally let it slip that they had hooked up and were actually dating. When I brought it up, my ex got really defensive and I dropped it.\n\nHe asked me out and we dated for 5 years. After the first year we had moved in together. I was having mental health issues towards the end and left the state to stay with my sister for a few months. We agreed to stay together, just long distance. He wasn't super communicative while I was gone and wouldn't text back or answer my calls consistently. He'd moved in with a mutual friend while I was gone since we weren't renting together anymore. When I came back he was distant and made excuses to not see me. Finally I'd had enough and ended it.\n\nLater on, pieces fell into place. Weird looks his friends and coworkers gave me when I ran into them, his excuses not making sense...finally his roommate admitted when he was drunk (without me asking lol) that he'd caught my ex bringing a girl home a few times. \n\nHe'd done to me what he had done to the girl before. He probably never broke up with her, just avoided her and told everyone she \"couldn't let it go\" when he wanted to move onto me. This time he likely told his coworkers that we'd broken up when I left and that I was being clingy and obsessive after I came back. When from my perspective, my boyfriend just stopped talking to me. Seems he wanted to date one of the girls he worked with and pulled the same shit. \n\nI'll never trust the \"crazy ex girlfriend\" story again unless I see some evidence.",

One of his exes is still a part of the friendship group, we've met, and she's a delightful human!  They just weren't right together, and that's okay. I think open communication about past relationships can be healthy, but if every single ex is \"a crazy bitch\" then there's a giant red flag.",

         "I realized how long this got. I'm not arguing on behalf of OP's ex, that guy is clearly a terrible lying cheat. But your comment happened to put me on a train of thought that snowballed and I just ended up with an autistic brain dump of a comment.\n\nI remember reading about this study where they surveyed a ton of couples with objective \"does your partner do x, y, z?\" types of questions as well as more subjective ones, all pertaining to different degrees and forms of abuse. The findings were very interesting.\n\nBy contrasting the objective and subjective responses, they found that women are much more likely to recognize abusive behavior as abuse. They found that emotional abuse was split pretty evenly according to the objective responses, but men responded in the subjective portion that their partners were not abusive despite indicating abuse in the objective portion far more often than the women, showing that most men simply don't understand what constitutes abuse.\n\nThose findings were actually fortified when split for same-sex couples where gay men's relationships reported around half the abuse of hetero relationships and lesbian relations reported twice as much abuse according to the subjective portions, but I believe the objective portions were still about the same. Most LGBTQ people carry a lot of trauma, though, so I think there's probably a lot to be compensated for to properly understand some of those dynamics.\n\nThat's not to say men are the victim, though. That lack of understanding goes both ways in that men are also less likely to recognize their own behaviors as abusive. I think this is also why it's so important to say \"I\" instead of \"you\" when communicating. When we say \"I feel this way about...\" we frame it from a personal perspective and when we say \"you x/y/z\" we're framing it as though it's fact, and that can potentially be a form of abuse.\n\nI think this lack of understanding is a large part of why men will use words like \"crazy\" or \"bitch\". Whether their partner is abusive or not is irrelevant, abuse is wrong, but as the study shows, most men won't recognize that behavior as abusive in either direction.\n\nPersonally, my gender identity is a little bit washy, I've never considered myself to be a \"man\", adult male sure, that's biology, but the notion of manhood doesn't really resonate with me and feels somewhat alien (gender identity can be different for those with autism). Nonetheless, I still try to view myself through the analytical lens applied to men's behavior.",

The kids are second or third on that list and then mostly because they're being forced to pay child support.

         "This comment is to hopefully give you more info that will help you feel better. Please don't take it as a personal attack.\n\nA constitutional abortion ban won't happen. The new SCOTUS ruling on Roe v Wade specifically returned abortion law rights to the states and ruled that it is not something that congress should (or will) be able to legislate. The only way for that to happen would be for Congress to make it a Constitutional Amendment, but there's no way that happens.\n\nAnd I don't mean \"it won't happen\" as in, \"they'll never try\". I mean statistically it **can not happen unless Democrats wanted it to happen**, which they obviously do not.\n\nAn abortion ban amendment would have to:\n\n* Pass the house with a 2/3rd vote, which means 290 votes. There are currently 220 (projected) republicans, which means that 70 out of 212 democrats (33%) would have to break ranks.\n\nIf it passed the house, the next step is\n\n* Pass the Senate with a 2/3rd vote, which means 67 votes. There are currently 52 republicans, which means that 15 of 45 democrats (33%) would have to break ranks\n\nIf it passes congress, then the it moves to \n\n* The States have to ratify it with a 3/4th majority. This means that **only 12 states have to vote against it**. This doesn't mean it's put to a public vote, it means the state legislature votes. Currently there are 21 out of 50 states that have Dem controlled Legislative bodies. This means that 10 out of 21 Dem controlled Legislative bodies (48%) would have to vote FOR an abortion ban even if it passed Congress. And that's if NONE of the red states with current abortion protection rights as part of their constitution (EG: Kansas) voted against an abortion ban either\n\nSo, ya, just based on that I would say it is the most unlikely of things to happen from this administration. I hope that helps you feel a little less terrible about that particular issue.",

We're currently looking at other options though.)\n\nWe already discussed how sex is pretty much going to be off the table if all forms of birth control are banned. We'd likely do everything else that doesn't involve vaginal or anal penetration.

Do whatever you want, of course, I'm not trying to tell you what to do or not do. But I'm letting you know you should think farther ahead about the long term consequences, not just the immediate consequences of your actions.\n\nLook at Mormon populations, they are absolutely booming. They have tons of kids and indoctrinate them well. Sure some will leave the church but they are breeding much faster than losing members. Meanwhile the feminists numbers are plummeting because they don't want kids, so they must rely on \"converts\" to join the cause.\n\nThis is not even a philosophical or moral argument, this is simple math.

Maybe if all women belong to the \"woman\" union, 4B can work and successfully change society. But there is a huge amount of diversity in women, especially in the US. When only a small percentage of a workforce is unionized, the union basically has zero power.\n\nThe result of 4B in the US will just be that the men will find Trump-supporting women to date and marry and have kids with. Just check the election results, there are *plenty* of them, and their numbers are growing, and will keep growing as they have more kids than feminist women.\n\nI understand the cause of 4B, I really do.

They all benefit from the labor of women in every aspect, they don't want equality they want PRIVILEGE. And they can't even be bothered the understand that Other people have different experiences and perspectives because \"it's all about them\"\n\nNow, when women band together and as groups say no, we understand the violent backlash that men will perpetrate against us. But, aren't they already: abducting, raping, torturing, selling, abusing, using, exploiting, and killing us already? SO what exactly do We have to lose?\n\nSome people were shocked at how mean I can be, well they feel like they are the only ones that can shock and degrade and be hateful without any challenge? They got the wrong one with Me, I'm close to 50, child of immigrants from a not so great country, Lady of color not heterosexual, that has had to deal with subtle and overt hate most days of my life, I also have cancer.  They come for our healthcare and the rights of women, minorities, and LGBT+ people- I am so eager to Unleash ALL this pent up rage inside, because I PERSONALLY have nothing left to lose. Not more fear or submission or pandering hoping that males will maybe treat us kindly. \n\nMen have never given women anything, Women had to struggle-suffer-fight to the little rights that we do have now. They take with impunity, then So should we.  Watch society implode without womens work ( physical, mental, emotional) they feel entitled to.",

It then got picked up for a supreme court opinion once the Trump appointees tipped SCOTUS's political leanings sufficiently (instead of a long, hard-fought litigation process like the one that resulted in the original opinion.) It embodies a minor group of individuals unilaterally dictating their conscience on nearly half the population. All that happened while the man who put those judges on the stand wasn't even in office or flexing his influence in an official capacity.\n\nTo add gas to that fire, thst same court wrote an opinion outlining how a sitting president basically can't be convicted of any crime for actions they take while in office just in time for perhaps the most sued / legally dubious man in the history of this nation to get back in the oval office. (See No. 23\u2013939. Decided July 1, 2024)\n\nI am fucking terrified. \n\nIf my SO cut me off tomorrow, I wouldn't complain one word.",

I was clear in my original post that anyone can and should do what they want.\n\nI am saying that actions have long term consequences, and those consequences matter, maybe not to you, but for the future people of the world.\n\nI am not saying that republicans are having kids *in order to* grow their political movement, that's definitely not the case. But it is certainly the case that any movement that strongly *values* having kids and passing on their values will grow more in the long term than a movement that doesn't value those things.\n\nYou can make any personal choice you want, I fully support personal choices. But just know that it might feel good for you now, but it will mean that you and your values are more likely to die and fade away over time, and other values will take their place. If you don't care about any of that, then fine, no biggie.\n\nI think what this really means for the feminist movement is that we need to actually find a place to value and support having kids, and raising them with the right values, because that is the best way to carry on a human legacy and ensure our values continue into the future and keep spreading to all of humanity.

Yes of course some of them come to the other side, but having a cultural default is incredibly powerful. Those families will keep growing, keep raising kids in those value systems, and therefore that value system will keep adding adherents, even if they lose a few along the way.\n\nNothing I'm saying precludes conversion or rebellion to topple a dictator. But I'm describing a mathematical reality of how value systems work and spread.\n\nI also never said anything about \"owing\" society babies. Again, I'm just saying that any movement that has kids and propagates their values will keep growing, and any movement that doesn't have kids or fails to propagate values will keep declining. It's simple math. \n\nYes it's possible to propagate values without having kids, by gaining converts, doing public education, but that's much harder, and riskier in the long run. \n\nIn some sense there will always be converts to feminism in a repressive patriarchal society, but the issue isn't feminism going to zero, the issue is feminism never having more than a tipping point of support that lets the movement actually enact policies.",

We can\u2019t move because of a child custody arrangement I have here. So Texas is the hellscape we\u2019re bound to.\n\nI asked if he would stay with me now that he knew where I stood. He said he wasn\u2019t sure because having a child and a family of his own was important to him. I asked if he was open to adoption or fostering. And after some back and forth trying to pull the answer out of him. He said no. The only way he\u2019d consider that is if he couldn\u2019t have them himself.\n\nI doubled down on my stance that I won\u2019t be getting pregnant. And by the time a new administration and new policies roll around, that\u2019ll put us approaching 40 and past the point of having a child.\n\nI told him he needed to think about it. Really think about it and have an answer for me before this weekend. I was supposed to meet his parents on Sunday. He was supposed to meet my family during the Thanksgiving holiday.\n\nThat conversation was 3 hours ago. He\u2019s cried on his own. I\u2019ve cried on my own. I\u2019m pretty sure I know his answer at this point.\n\nIt hurts to realize that what we have isn\u2019t enough for him.

Once Roe v Wade was overturned the hope of trying for a biological child died. So we looked at adoption. Certainly there would be a child out there who needed us. This election killed that dream too. I no longer want children. I can't bring myself to raise a child in this world anymore. How can you raise a tiny human in a place that you know is actively becoming worse?

I wanted to be done having children by 35, but then had a miscarriage, which ended up bumping my last pregnancy into my 36th year. I secretly didn\u2019t really feel done until I hit 45. \n\nI don\u2019t think my mom wanted to have all the children she did, but claimed the pill made her feel like she was going crazy. At the time she told me this, I thought she was being overly dramatic, but in the 60\u2019s, this easily could have been the case.\n\nI went through the feeling of wishing I had younger parents and feeling almost resentful at times, but my parents had other children way earlier, and not one of them was me. Either I exist, or was never born, and I have the choice as to whether to exist. But also, I felt really old in my 20s so I don\u2019t think I would\u2019ve been any better off having children then. I was sick all the time and I even got shingles once. By the time I was pregnant at 36, it was a great pregnancy and an easy birth. \n\nMy sister talks about how giving birth when you\u2019re older is harder, but I asked her how she would know since she was a teen with her first and had six children and one miscarriage in the span of 10 years. Of course it was going to be hard for her when she was having some babies a year apart.",

A baby is a *person*, equally capable of love and family bonding - they aren't \"worth more\" because they carry his DNA. Plus, given that abortions are banned, there will be so many children (even newborns to be given up at birth) needing adoption! You even have a child right now, does he not consider them to be family?\n\nOP, your boyfriend is basically admitting that adoption **is** acceptable to him in the worst case scenario... but losing the woman he claims to love most in the world doesn't qualify? His assumption, until you clarified, was that you were just going to casually carry his child in Texas - despite everything going on right now?

This is demonstrated in fertility stats that reproductive endocrinologists use to build IVF protocols. Our fertility stats pretty good all the way till about 39\nThen drops sharply and continues to drop sharply each year after that. It\u2019s also clearly demonstrated in IVF cycle success.

And while it would've been very terrifying under normal circumstances, I think I was too sick & delirious to know how scary that truly was.

No woman should be forced into facing that because of dumb legislation. \n\nI'm in CO, so I'm very lucky atm.

         "No, it\u2019s fine.  Main note is that I can\u2019t vouch for how it is for anyone else, just myself.\n\nI\u2019ve been relatively close to death I think 3 times so far, and it\u2019s all been relatively similar.  The biggest feeling is just exhaustion.  I would feel so incredibly, overwhelmingly tired where just falling asleep is the most tempting thing in the world.  Staying awake and aware is so much work and it\u2019s so easy to just let go and slip away.  I don\u2019t know if I would describe it as peaceful but it definitely wasn\u2019t scary until I got better enough to contextualize everything.  At the time it was just like\u2026calm?  I weirdly had no anxiety and even though I knew I wasn\u2019t doing well, it didn\u2019t matter.  I felt like I would just accept whatever happened if I could just rest.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry for what you are going through, that\u2019s an incredible psychological challenge.  I think that the actual dying part isn\u2019t that bad in the moment, it just feels like finally being able to rest after so much suffering.  Obviously the situations aren\u2019t the same since ultimately I could recover, but in the moment actually experiencing it?  It was a relief.  I\u2019d definitely say that you shouldn\u2019t worry about the actual dying part.  You should be loaded up with morphine and the scary part will just be seeing your loved ones so sad and thinking about what you will miss out on, not the actual process of dying.\n\nI\u2019m sorry if that reply is too presumptuous on my part.",
         "Yeah, sadly the whole stapling ranked choice voting to jungle primaries is what killed it 100%.  I\u2019m hoping that they can drop the jungle primaries and just put ranked choice on the ballot in 2 years if possible because I would love to see how it does then!\n\nAlso, thank you!  Given how we\u2019ve enshrined abortion rights I get the feeling that we are gonna have to be there for women from Texas, Oklahoma, etc as well."

Honestly, in that world...if you were worrying about being pregnant before, you would have had to worry for at least 3 more years.\n\nCurrently (depending on where you live) now might be the SAFEST time to be pregnant. In states with abortion rights, the GOP can't do anything. Once Jan 20, 2025 hits...I don't think a ban will come immediately. I think it may take a year. There will be clammorings for an abortion ban nationally, and we can't trust the GOP to not go along and try. They WILL ban abortion drugs crossing state lines, that will be quick. A flat ban, truth is 50% chance it even happens...and will certainly be at least a year before taking effect.\n\nNow, say you are in a state with NO abortion protections: it is more grim than you think (sorry). Trump will get 2 more justices on SCOTUS, which will enshrine Dobbs for at least 25 years. So, no help within the next 4 years minimum.\n\nNow, say Dems take power in 2028...we will have to see. Truth is, same analysis from the first situation, they won't pass national abortion rights immediately. The bill will take time, be contested tooth and nail, and won't even be possible with certain margins of victory. And if they get passed, any law will CERTAINLY be litigated for years, and end up with (possibly even more) conservative SCOTUS.\n\nThis election wasn't about having abortion rights in 2025...it was really about having a chance at them by late 2026.

Maybe it wasn't always that way, obviously it *shouldn't* be that way, but it is. \n\nAnyone who can't face it and accept it is not deserving of your time, attention, or love.

The only people voting red are: genuinely clueless, brainwashed, coerced, or - most commonly - monstrous. \n\n'I don't want to talk about politics' just means I don't give a shit about your rights and never will.

You feel he did something wrong that hurt you personally and i would hope he doesn't yet see why.\n\nTo decide what you should do in your relationship you have to try and figure out his motives and intent, as well as how informed he was about the possible negative impact to you and other women. You need to determine where you and other women fell in his priorities in the choice and what he believes is right and wrong regarding women.\n\nYou have to explain what you believe is right, and why, and why you believe that his choice hurt you. \n\nNeither of you is likely to convince the other of anything you don't already believe, but it's very important to figure out if he knowingly made a choice he knew would/might impact you, how it would impact you, and what he thinks is right and wrong and most important.\n\nReconciling these things is what will determine if you cam move forward. \n\n-------\n\nFiguring out where each of you fall as voters may help:\n\nSome people believe in many absolutes and won't vote for anyone who has a single stance they find amoral, no matter how moral their other positions are. \n\nSome people believe in single absolutes and will vote for anyone who supports the single policy that they believe is most important no matter how amoral the other policies are. \n\nSome people don't care about being informed and don't want to spend the energy to learn about all the possible implications of their vote, they just hear something and go along with that because it sounded nice.\n\nMany of us take a more complicated position; we do the utilitarian math. We try and decide who will do the greatest good for the greatest number of people and who will do the most harm to the greatest number of people. We get informed, or at least try, and we do the hard math...and still don't arrive at the same conclusions.\n\nSometimes the morality/amorality of these choices have casualties, and often those casualties are loved ones.

Performative kindness is how a woman ends up married to a monster without realizing it, and that is especially scary now since Republicans are talking about ending no fault divorce. His vote for the fascist party could be telling of who he really is under the performative acts. \n\nAlso, if he sees you are genuinely upset and isn't willing to talk about it because he just doesn't want to, that is pretty telling too. In a relationship, you will disagree on things. That he will try to get out of discussing something important tells me he probably isn't willing to work on his flaws in order to make you happy.

That includes this election too. For example - something like Trump should have never even been a candidate at all, regardless of who is willing to vote for him). \n\nhttps://redsails.org/the-pitfalls-of-liberalism/ (to understand why neoliberals are historically and systemically complicit in that violence).\n\n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1884/origin-family/\n(Works of Frederick Engels 1884, The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State, to understand how patriarchy, birth, capitalism and abortions are connected). \n\nBasically, the institution of patriarchal family required, as its foundation, the dominance of the man over the woman and the confinement of all property relations within the family / to secure property inheritance within male lineage. As a result, women were confined to roles of childbearing and household labor, making them \"means of production and reproduction\" to sustain family wealth. This structure arose from the value placed on private property and inheritance, creating social control over women\u2019s labor and reproduction. Capitalism later built on this setup, relying on women\u2019s unpaid domestic labor to maintain a steady workforce, reinforcing male dominance and the exploitation of women to sustain the economic system.\n\n\nIn addition:\n\n1) Read leftist theory. Political education IS important to truly grasp what is happening in your society & why and why it obviously affects you and your rights and so on. \n\n2) Join leftist orgs, in particular marxist feminist orgs in your community, if you have none, start forming them! Endless of women who could never rely on the US settler state and its laws  to protect them or aid them, had to rely through history on mutual aid, being part of a community that shows up for eachother and so on. (That includes underground movements). \n\n(Note: I wanted to make a radical marxist feminist platform on discord, meaning anti western imperial, capitalist and choice feminist nonsense - that does not center straight cis men - anyone is interested, hit me up via PM). \n\n3) Organized protests. No, not holding signs and bs - organized worker protests with demands. You will have to connect across your country, decide on the demands you have and walk out. Walk out of your jobs, your roles as mothers, grandmothers, workers. You all have been the shit pacified while not acknowledging that your BIGGEST weapon is the fact that you make half of your society and if you refuse to do labor for a certain period of time - your society is gonna shake. They rely on your free labor, your physical labor, all of it. \n\n4) Divest from men, build and nurture solidarity and community with other women. Think \"xyz dude is cute\", does he give a fuck about your rights? Does he give a fuck about systemic oppression, history and so on? No? Move on. Stop putting your energy into relationships with men who do not even care for your basic human rights. \n\n5) Divest from sex in any form that can get you pregnant. There are endless of other ways to get off. Maybe that will motivate some of the men in your life to actually give a fck? Probably not hmm. Eitherway, less chances to get pregnant. \n\n6) If that is not a sacrifice you want to bring for more safety and you still want to take more risks, copper IUD, hormonal IUD, hormonal implant, tied tubes & expecting the men in your life to step tf up! Keep in mind that even after vasectomies it might not be safe for months & there needs to be a frequent visits to make sure sperm count is in order (plus still use condoms in addition to make sure you are safe). Never center short term convenience and pleasure over your physical safety in a society that will treat you as an incubator and is more than willing to see you dead.\n\n7) Pregnancy strike. I am not sure how any woman is still willing to pop babies... but those ideologies and rules are not only for women who don't want kids. If you want kids you are not automatically \"safe\". It could still get you killed. Consider that. \n\n8) Do not automatically trust your family, partner or doctors or anyone, if you deal with unwanted pregnancy. \n\n9) Don't leave any traces or records online those track your period & could potentially be used to incriminate you.\n\n10) Consider moving to another country if it is something you can afford. \n\n11) Have an emergency fund if that is something you can afford.\n\n12) Train & arm yourself.\n\n13) if you were contemplating divorce - go for it now.",

They see that work subjects them to more danger from more men; it increases the risk of sexual exploitation. They see that creativity and originality in their kind are ridiculed; they see women thrown out of the circle of male civilization for having ideas, plans, visions, ambitions. They see that traditional marriage means selling to one man, not hundreds: the better deal. They see that the streets are cold, and that the women on them are tired, sick, and bruised. They see that the money they can earn will not make them independent of men and that they will still have to play the sex games of their kind: at home and at work too. They see no way to make their bodies authentically their own and to survive in the world of men. They know too that the Left has nothing better to offer: leftist men also want wives and whores; leftist men value whores too much and wives too little. Right-wing women are not wrong. They fear that the Left, in stressing impersonal sex and promiscuity as values, will make them more vulnerable to male sexual aggression, and that they will be despised for not liking it. They are not wrong. Right-wing women see that within the system in which they live they cannot make their bodies their own, but they can agree to privatized male ownership: keep it one-on-one, as it were. They know that they are valued for their sex\u2014 their sex organs and their reproductive capacity\u2014and so they try to up their value: through cooperation, manipulation, conformity; through displays of affection or attempts at friendship; through submission and obedience; and especially through the use of euphemism\u2014\u201cfemininity, \u201d \u201ctotal woman, \u201d \u201cgood, \u201d \u201cmaternal instinct, \u201d \u201cmotherly love. \u201d Their desperation is quiet; they hide their bruises of body and heart; they dress carefully and have good manners; they suffer, they love God, they follow the rules. They see that intelligence displayed in a woman is a flaw, that intelligence realized in a woman is a crime. They see the world they live in and they are not wrong. They use sex and babies to stay valuable because they need a home, food, clothing. They use the traditional intelligence of the female\u2014animal, not human: they do what they have to survive.\u201d",

         "The \"blue states funding the red states\" is a partial intentional misrepresentation by those who have interest in you believing it's that simple.  These figures typically include things like farming subsidies that go to predominantly rural areas, which tend to skew heavily republican, to encourage farmers to invest more in agriculture or subsidies for energy like shale or oil exploration/drilling/refining.  This helps to keep America from being dependent on foreign interests and helps to lower prices nationally, including in blue states.\n\nI am certain there are still gaps, and the cities will always to some extent prop up rural areas, but it's not as clear cut as some articles report it to be.  If it were we'd be able to cut out the mid-west, Texas, and the like and be economically stronger, and that just isn't remotely close to the truth.",

         "A common sentiment in the comments is \"division is why we are here\".  I want to interrogate that a bit.\n\nThere is a gulf between people.  What is that gulf?  The current assertion is that it is a gap of attainment and sense of purpose, that people feel left behind by modern economic society and want something else - literally anything else - and Trump's republicanism is portrayed as both incredibly shit and also something else.\n\nLet's set aside that Trump is obviously neoliberalism on steroids.  Is that gap to do with civic division? Not really - people across the political spectrum agree that neoliberalism isn't working.  The difference isn't between people doing relatively well and people poorer off, because there is lunatic wealth atop the pyramid on both sides of the division.\n\nBut there is a suggestion that there is something culturally divided between those on each side.  Except it's hard to say that this gap is not itself one of consumer culture.  Do you watch Joe Rogan and Andrew Tate and Fox, or alternatively the many Christian cultural bubbles?\n\nThere is clearly a gap here, because this media simply doesn't appeal to people who lean left, and there's a similar repulsion of people in left-leaning media towards people who lean right.  Our media consumption has split into streams - there is liberal and there is conservative, and what people consider \"balanced\" seems to be viewed as either suspicious, boring or \"inaccessible\".\n\nThis in itself need not necessarily be a problem.  However, what you find with a lot of modern media and consumption in general is that we started somewhere to introduce the idea of \"Community\".  You are the \"Joe Rogan Community\", the \"Magic the Gathering community\", the \"Walmart Employee Community\".  Participation in a particular consumable thing becomes a site of collective organisation as a marketing tool, brands now become part of individual identities, and consumption culture is key to the curation of the self.\n\nDivision is not why we are here.  \"Communities\" are why we are here.  People have begun not to divide themselves from each other but to seek more active bonds with other people that share their views and watching preferences, and this isn't something that comes from the desire to separate but a desire to closer connect.\n\nI believe this is the key argument against the \"we have to stick together\" case to reject reconfiguring the state.  People do not really abstractly work like that any more - they pin their identities and being to their beliefs, their consumption, their media, much more than they do towards the people around them.  It is in fact much more likely to successfully establish a liberal constitution at a more local level to work with this fact of modern human psychology, because people can buy in or sell out as they like.\n\nThis is, after all, what capitalism has trained them to be.",

It's partly because of these subsidies that the US produces about 1/3rd of the world's supply of corn.  This would mostly affect rural areas where farmland is common, rural areas disproportionately found in red states and certainly red counties even within blue states.\n\nThis still benefits blue states and blue counties.  The subsidies lower the cost of production and encourages increased production which further reduces the cost due to simple supply-demand concepts.  As corn is so ubiquitous it reduces the cost for a wide range of goods including foodstuffs beyond corn itself, fuels, and a wide-range of consumer goods.\n\nThe long and short of it is that it's very difficult to unpack the full effect of economic policy and any simple chart showing state takers and givers are going to be overly simplistic.  Because it is overly simplistic and so emotionally charged (politics are very emotional) it lends itself to being exaggerated, misunderstood, or misrepresented to make a larger point.\n\nAgain, this isn't to say the overall point doesn't have merit.  Red states do likely take more than they give in terms of economic output.  Cities will generally have a higher economic output per capita and per sq mi, and cities are overwhelmingly blue.

The genocide in Argentina, all the shit in Afghanistan and Iraq over the decades, the radicalization of a lot of Arab counter-revolutionaries to fight the Soviets in Afghanistan, etc etc etc. Brutalizing Cuba with an embargo for no good reason. \n\nWe weren't just doing fuck shit in Latin America in the 60s and 70s, you have to go back to the late 1800s to see the beginnings of US imperialism in Latin America. Banana republic the term was coined in 1904. The crap we did later on, the coups and support of genocides and dictators, was largely us trying to maintain hegemony in the region when anti-colonial movements arose.\n\nWe allowed trade to flow through the Suez Canal by supporting ethnic cleansing and occupation of the Palestinians.

I imagine that as time has gone on, the technological developments of war have allowed for countries to do violence without experiencing it as much as they used to (see: drone strikes and bombings as opposed to ye olden battlefields with horses and swords and shit). But that doesn't mean they aren't brutal, and that people don't experience great cruelty in war still.\n\nI think it's actually possible that we will see an increase in conflict deaths and genocide due to climate change, for instance.\n\nHowever even the researchers who conduct these studies have said that it is hard to say for sure if it is accurate - here's the lead researcher, Brennen Fagan, PhD: \n\n\"Data on war deaths will never be perfect. Firstly, it is difficult to know which deaths to include in the data set as many deaths are often brought about indirectly from war -- such as famine or outbreaks of disease. For example, should deaths from Spanish Influenza be counted in the total number of deaths from the First World War?\n\n\"We also acknowledge that the data is likely to be Eurocentric, with the possibility that many deaths incurred by conflicts in the developing world have not been included.\n\n\"While it has its shortcomings, our analysis provides a methodology for future investigations and an empirical basis for political and historical discussions.\"\n\nhttps://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/06/200616113913.htm",

      "text": "Dear Mom,\n\nWhen I was a little girl, you told me how historic it was for women to get the right to have a bank account and credit card in the 1970s. You were a young woman, just starting out in the adult world, and you had hope for equality.\n\nIn 2nd grade, for career day at school we were asked to dress up as what we wanted to be when we grew up. I said I wanted to be a teacher like you and grandma. You sat me down and explained how you didn't have many options for a career, and you were fortunate to go to college at all. You said I had so many options you didn't, and I better not waste them. I promised I wouldn't be a teacher. \n\nAfter you separated from my father, I watched you run the household all by yourself. You mowed the lawn, fixed the toilet, painted the house. You told me men will let you down and I needed to know how to do things myself. \n\nI moved away for college and grew into a successful independent woman. I did not repeat the mistakes you warned me about, with my career or my relationships. I carried those lessons with me. You were proud.\n\nYet today, I am so deeply disappointed in you and the million women like you. How did you raise me to be a feminist and then fail to be one yourself? What made you choose a rapist and conman who will hurt my future and the future of your granddaughters?\n\nYour father fought the nazis in north Africa. Your grandmother you never met was in a camp in Vichy France. The horrors of facism are not some distant history. It's our family's history, and so many other American families too. How can you be on the side of people who wave swastika flags?\n\nI thought you were better than this. I thought our country was better than this. I feel absolutely sick to be so wrong. And now I don't know how to speak to you again. \n\nSincerely,\n\nYour Daughter",

      "title": "Tips for getting sterilized from someone that did it at 25",
      "text": "First off, here is the list of OBGYNs that have shown they are willing to sterilize young people with or without kids. This list is not exhaustive but a good resource. My doctor is not on this list. \n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Djia_WkrVO3S4jKn6odNwQk7pOcpcL4x00FMNekrb7Q/edit?resourcekey=&gid=1318374028#gid=1318374028\n\n\n1) Do not be afraid to switch doctors. I go to a large practice with several doctors. I really disliked my OBGYN for multiple reasons and had been wanting to switch to a different one for a while and also knew she would never do the surgery. I spoke with my NP at the practice who I love and she helped me switch to a doctor at the practice that she was pretty confident would do the surgery.\n\n\n2) so important: ASK FOR THE SURGERY EVERY TIME YOU INTERACT WITH THE OFFICE EVEN IF YOU KNOW THEY WILL SAY NO. This is the only reason I was able to get my surgery. When I switched to my now doctor, our first every appt together we did my surgery consult and at the end she said \"ok we will get you scheduled. I normally would make patients wait a year but I see in your chart you have been asking for this every appointment since you started coming here at 18\". If your appointments are a couple months out I would even call the office every 2 months or so and just say \"I would like a note added to my chart that I am calling on X day reiterating my decision and request to be sterilized\". MAKE SURE THEY ARE PUTTING YOUR REQUESTS IN YOUR CHART. YOU NEED THIS PAPER TRAIL.\n\n\n3) Know your reasons/come up with reasons you are willing to share but do not share them unless asked. For example, one of my 100s of reasons is climate change but that is kind of controversial so I didnt share that. I just reiterated my firm decision that I am sure I dont want children. During the consult my doctor said something like \"ok I just want to make sure I know why you are choosing this and its not like climate change fears or something external\". So play your cards close to the chest but know you will have to give firm reasons so have them ready. If you seem like you are coming up with answers on the spot, that may hurt you. They need to know you have thought hard about this for a long time.\n\n\n4) Time it right! As stated before I had been asking for years but I put all my energy into this post Dobbs and made sure it was completed before I turned 26 so that my parents insurances covered it. Given the ACA is likely about to be gone, do not wait on this if this is an option for you.  ended up having to pay ZERO for my surgery.\n\n\n5) do not be scared of the surgery. probably preaching to the choir here but the surgery is the easiest medical procedure i have ever done. recovery pain was almost no existent. my scars are tiny/basically non existent. the surgery also actually helps reduce your risk for ovarian cancer which is a huge bonus.\n\n\n6) dont tell people that dont need to know, at least until those tubes are out. you dont need anyone gumming up the works, causing issues. now that they are out, i tell everyone. \n\n\n7) last funny tip, they probably wont let you keep your tubes afterward but it doesnt hurt to ask. mine were sent off to be tested for cancer but I really wanted to keep them in a jar on my shelf lol\n\n\nIm almost 28 now and I do not regret the surgery at all. I love my doctor and Im so glad she did this for me. \n\n\nplease share any tips you have in the comments.",
      "comments": [
         "My tip that got me my surgery at 29; if you have autism or PTSD, **lean into how much of a struggle it is.**\n\nAnd if they cite a future husband? **Tell them you're too anxious about pregnancy to even think about dating.** They worry more about a hypothetical husbands feelings than your health.\n\nOn the third or fourth discussion about getting a hysterectomy i said something along the lines of, \"what kind of life would a child have with how autistic I am?\" And *that* got the gears turning and off my doctor went to discuss things with their surgeon. And I had the surgery scheduled days later. \n\nThese institutions still have a eugenicist underbelly. Tickle it to get what you need. I had endometriosis growths on my lungs and have zero regrets using my disabilities this way.\n\nWhile it's in my chart and have official diagnostic papers for both, they didn't ask for additional confirmation of my disorders.",
         "Can you talk about specifics? Like how many days off you needed to recover? Recovering from anesthesia? How long you stayed in hospital? How much it hurt?\nI had a traumatic birth in July and was scheduled for tubal ligation in September. I cancelled it because I felt my body had suffered enough. Not sure I want to revisit it. It is downplayed to women as \u201cnothing\u201d but infact is major surgery with general anesthesia, breathing tube and that was offputting",
         "I asked my doctor when I was 28. She told me the options and I chose to wait\u00a0to be sure of what I wanted (and I was scared of the surgery in general since I'd never been put under).\n\n\nAt 33 years old I went back in and asked again because I knew at that point and my doctor knew that the answer was still the same. Bilateral salpingectomies were more common at that point than the first time I had inquired.\u00a0\n\n\n5 years on, no regrets.",
         "How are you able to get insurance to cover \"non-medically necessary\" sterilization?",
         "How many days off?\n\nI work from home so I took just a week off. Doctor advised people working regular jobs should take off 2 weeks. \n\nAnesthesia reconvert?\n\nI was completely fine. I remember counting to 10 and then I woke up in the recording room. \n\n\nHospital stay?\n\nIt was outpatient. I got there in the morning and left that afternoon. \n\n\nHow much it hurt?\n\n1/10 on the pain scale\n\n\n\nI don\u2019t mean to downplay it as nothing just ease peoples fears. It is statistically much safer than pregnancy and most are done laparoscopically so the incisions are very smal. My belly button has a tiny extra scar and I have about a 1cm scar to the left of my pubes. Way less invasive than a c section or other abdominal surgery. \n\nI would regrow my tubes and have the surgery ten times over going to the dentist for a filling. It was truly a stress free experience for me and I just want to help ease people\u2019s fears.",
         "Not OP, but I had a bisalp (bilateral salpingectomy, not tubal ligation) in August. I was 37 at the time of surgery.  My answers pretty much mirror u/hideousbeautifulface\\--though my scars are higher up on my abdomen. More a few inches to either side and a couple of inches lower than my belly button. \n\nI took off two days from work. I was up and walking around the afternoon of the surgery and didn't feel too woozy or in much pain. The weirdest thing was urinating post surgery. For whatever reason, they didn't have me do that at the surgery center, even though I've read that it's standard for them to ensure that you can at least urinate post op. I was back to taking walks a few days post op and began lifting weights again one week post op. \n\nTake stool softeners a day or so beforehand. Keep yourself hydrated and regular, and I'd recommend using a pillow or towel against your abdomen if you feel like you're straining to poo shortly after the surgery. There's a slight risk for hernia, so don't do anything weird. I only took Motrin. My gyno prescribed a few Tylenol 3 + Codeine for me, but I didn't use them. Not my jam. \n\nIn your pre-op appointment with your doctor, ask lots of questions! You will be able to chat with the anesthesiologist before you head into the operating room, too, and they'll answer all of your questions and are generally such kind, comforting people. I was scheduled to sing the weekend after my Monday surgery, and they made sure to use the smallest tube they could to avoid irritating my throat. All went great, and it was way more comfortable than my throat was after ankle surgery earlier this year-- I was very hoarse for days. \n\nOther benefit? I apparently had cysts on one of my fallopian tubes. My periods are more chill now! \n\nI'm sorry you experienced a traumatic birth. This surgery should be much better by comparison, but I don't want to diminish your experiences or presume that yours would be the same as mine, but I do think it's worth revisiting.",

If he has a gun, take out the firing pin and flush it down the toilet.\n\nLeave the seat down. Give him the cold shoulder. Fuck a woman and have an orgasm for once.

Take a look at anyone who's been President and her resume is among the best.  She's incredibly bright and would have been great at bringing qualified, talented people to fill positions in her administration.  Trump and his cabal is the antithesis of that and we as a nation lost a great opportunity.  That said, it's clear many in the US choose to be willfully ignorant and its citizenry racist and sexist to their very core (even some women).   We suffers as a nation because we have existed in a silo of sorts.  There's a whole other world out there and WE are not the center of it.  Don't get me wrong, I love my country, but I'm not optimistic about its future as a democracy.  \n\nOne also has to look at the toxic influence of money in our electoral system.  Look for Trump to uses the threat of tariffs to bring industrial interests to heel and it will only get worse as the Oligarch class becomes entrenched in our governance going forward.",

Not exactly stirring. Not courageous.\n\nI heard the quite and it made me think of a worse thing than it was. But the context illustrates why she lost.",

         "She literally said she would outlaw fracking. There are videos/commercials of her saying it. And, if you can link to a video of her saying \"genocide, woohoo!\", I'd love to see it. As for \"more deportations,\" I don't think she said it that way, but, yes. There were a lot more illegal immigrants pouring over the borders during the Biden administration and that would ultimely result in more deportations.",

         "That maybe and most probably is true. I'm not sure we fully know this. I think we know it to an extent. But at the same time Michelle was pulling so far above Trump at the time Harris was handed the nomination. That would have been a nice starting point. \n\nBut also, I admit, maybe that's wishful thinking on my side. Doesn't change the fact that she was wildly unpopular. And given that she did a great job. But it's really hard to overcome that kind of deficit.",
         "Yes I think this exposed the ability of the electorate to ignore morality and ethics. \n\nBut if the Dems keep saying they lost because more than half the country are racist and misogynist pigs, they will continue losing. It's more to it than that. \n\nThese battles are won by winning over the middle. And unfortunately the middle cares more about economic issues, the border crisis, interest rates. In my mind, that is a foreign concept. I would have voted for a golden retriever before voting for that orange, rudderless, unethical a******. \n\nBut I also am very aware that the left has positioned themselves as a morality police and therefore the right dismisses all morality arguments as a leftist argument. It's quite a catch-22.",
         "Id like to think it's partly about the message. Like Bernie had a message and not really a story. He talked policy that would help average people and everyone loved him.\nThat being said, half the country absolutely hates AOC and she has a very similar message.\nThis country hates women.",
         "Personally I loved Harris. She is super smart, highly accomplished and well spoken. I think misogyny explains exactly why she was \"highly unpopular\".  There is literally no other reason.",
         "The middle class doesn\u2019t care about economic issues or the border. If they did they wouldn\u2019t have voted for the candidate whose economic policy is expected to cause a recession and skyrocket the debt. Or the candidate who prevented a bipartisan border bill. \n\nThey think they do. But really they are just mad. And policy doesn\u2019t matter. And the candidate doesn\u2019t matter. They just don\u2019t want the current people in charge. \n\nAnd it\u2019s hard to say the people who voted for Trump aren\u2019t racist when trumps only policy is mass deportations of immigrants. And not just illegal immigrants. They\u2019re talking about revoking legal status of the Haitians in Ohio. They\u2019re talking about revoking the legal status of dreamers.",
         "yes, I loved her too, personally. Something tells me if she were a man then she would have been suddenly so much more supported.",
         "I'm not dismissing anyone who loves Harris. But I'm also guessing you are a true dyed in the wool Democrat. Whether we like it or not, that's not how elections are won. The fact that Trump won the popular vote by a lot should scare everyone who is a Democrat.",
         "That's my point; the country hates women that much that Trump actually won the popular vote. I am centrist, I've been enculturated by US capitalism my entire life. Personally, tho, I do prefer people in power who offer hope and unity over division and hate. I prefer well educated articulate leaders over rambling fear mongers. I want a society that is more secular. But, seems our country is headed down a different path chosen by people with different priorities. Oh well, it won't affect me much."

Isn\u2019t it more productive to choose to focus on yourself instead of doing things to punish men?\n\nFocus first and foremost on your economic power because that makes you less dependent on men in the first place. That means girls and young women prioritizing education and career tracks that lead to higher paying jobs and financial freedom. We don\u2019t have the luxury to pursue careers out of passion. We don\u2019t have the luxury to prefer work-life-balance / flexible working in exchange for lower pay.

Men are already whining about girls and women outperforming them in schools and universities - how about we push that into the workforce as well. Whatever field you are in, aim for the highest paid / most respected / highest potential path. The sooner you are not financially reliant on your partner / family, the sooner you are free: free to escape bad relationships, free to move to blue states. Eventually with economic success, you\u2019ll also be free to financially support the business and causes that you do believe in. \n\nLook at how men have been amassing money and power and influence over the past centuries.

The Democrats were *sure* she was going to win in 2016. Why? She didn\u2019t. They were *sure* Harris was going to win this time. She didn\u2019t. How can they be this oblivious? \n\nThey botched this whole 2024 process (or lack thereof) with someone who was the first to drop out in 2020. And so, in every single metric, Harris did worse than Hillary Clinton. \n\nAnd the Democrats had a good message over the summer, about the economy, but dropped it to focus on things that are misunderstood or are abstractions to most voters. \"Fascism\" and \"democracy on the ballot.\" While most voters are saying, \"why are eggs so expensive?\" Harris dropped all that good summer stuff about affordable rent, college, gas and power bills, corporate responsibility, minimum wage. Just poof. Exit polls in swing states showed that Biden had a 60% disapproval rate there. Harris did nothing to distance herself from him or his record (even for political reasons).\n\nThe Democratic Party thinks it's a majority party, but it's not. America is high school. The Democrats are the theater kids, the AV club, the chess team, debate team, the kids taking AP classes, Tracy Flick and Mark Ratner. The Republican (voters) are the kids taking regular classes, playing sports, fixing cars, having keggers, Stacy and Brad Hamilton. The \"regular kids\" aren't going to follow the theater kids, unless someone comes along with super charisma like Bill Clinton or Obama. *And* speaks about the economy. \n\nIt's always the economy. People throw names around like \"socialist\" and \"fascist\" but it's always the economy. Trump supporters, 49% said that the economy was their #1 issue. For Harris voters it was 12%. Almost everyone who was worried about the economy voted for Trump. Because nobody knew who Harris was or what she was going to do (a) differently than Biden, and (b) to help.\n\nAbortion is incredibly important, but it's not something that most Americans (including, we discovered, most women) care about enough to swing things. Abortion is a \"tomorrow problem\" for voters. Maybe it'll be a problem for them in the future. The economy is a problem for them now.\n\nThis was so botched.

It\u2019s being talked about like it\u2019s the only option. It sounds like people think the only branches on this decision tree are giving birth or abortion. No one is talking about abstinence, birth control, or contraception; the literal ABCs of safe sex. Are there cases where these aren\u2019t options? Of course. Do I think there is a place for abortion? Yes. No woman should have to fee they have to die to give birth in the instance of a problematic birth and no woman should be forced to birth the child of a rapist\u2026FURTHER contributing to the physical and psychological trauma they have endured.

This poses as a major vulnerability, particularly for those at risk of criminalization for seeking an abortion.\n\nBefore *Roe v Wade* was even overturned, Dr. Randall Williams, former Missouri state health director, tracked the menstrual cycles of women who visited Planned Parenthood, which was used to identify individuals who might have had abortions following failed termination procedures. To clarify, this doctor holds anti-abortion views.\n\nSource: [*Should you worry about data from your period-tracking app being used against you?*](https://www.politifact.com/article/2022/may/12/ask-khn-politifact-should-you-worry-about-data-you/)\n\nThe former director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, Scott Lloyd, took a disturbing approach by tracking menstrual cycles for potential criminal prosecutions and, in at least one instance, for experimentation:\n\n>Lloyd has\u00a0admitted\u00a0to pressuring these young women to keep their pregnancies. Seemingly, he was quite strenuous in his insistence. In one email, Lloyd relates that a pregnant woman in his care who was seeking\u2014and being kept from having\u2014an abortion mentioned suicide. In response to that,\u00a0he writes: \u201cThe clinician describes her demeanor as 'obnoxious' and that 'the unborn child is in our care so the medical team should continue with standard prenatal care.'\" If she continued to want an abortion after \u201cspiritual counseling,\u201d Lloyd continues, she\u2019d have to obtain parental consent.\n\nSource: [*The U.S. Is Tracking Migrant Girls' Periods to Stop Them From Getting Abortions*](https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/politics/a26985261/trump-administration-abortion-period-tracking-migrant-women/)\n\nExperts are concerned.

Avoid discussing topics like your menstrual cycle, pregnancy, or general women\u2019s health on devices like computers or phones. Reproductive health data can be stored across all digital platforms.

It is difficult to get most people to care about other issues if they are struggling to pay the bills. Regardless of who has the best plan and whos fault it is, and how bad tarrifs might be (people dont understand tariffs) Kamala is too close to Biden to not get the blame on this one from the common voter. Immigration is the second which plays into the economy as people see oh we are paying x amount per immigrant and i see them on every corner and i am struggling to pay the rent and now my taxes are going up. The third most important is of course abortion. It will be #1 among this sub and #1 among women but the issue is i think it's harder to get the voters from older non child bearing women even many mothers, as well as men of course even fathers and especially not young men. \n\nSo ultimately in short it's just people cared about the economy more that they did abortion, not because it's a more important issue, but it just effects more people so it will be a larger voting issue for them.",

They cannot force you to withhold care, or compassion from those that would need it. **They cannot force you to go back, unless you let them.** And if they try, we have the power to resist by any means necessary. Civil, or uncivil; legally, or illegally. The sovereignty of one's self exists in your own hands. \n\nThere is an old slogan attributed to Samuel Colt, one that has always rung true since its conception: \"God made men. Colt made them equal.\".\n\nRemember that ladies, gentlemen, and anyone beyond & between: people have power. You have power. And while I hope the day never never comes where that power has to wielded, remember that if it does: at least half of this nation was on your side.\n\nPeace & prosperity to all, and may you stay safe \u270c\ufe0f",

For example, when the Muslim ban happened and was hastily implemented, it left people literally stranded at airports. In real time, this information was put on Twitter and lawyers electively showed up at airports to offer people free legal support. That is just *one* example of the real time community building that happened. Is there a place like that? Should a sub be started? IDk if it could do what Twitter did back then, but it could be something. Lots of different people from different subs would have to join.

That includes this election too. For example - something like Trump should have never even been a candidate at all, regardless of who is willing to vote for him). \n\nhttps://redsails.org/the-pitfalls-of-liberalism/ (to understand why neoliberals are historically and systemically complicit in that violence).\n\n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1884/origin-family/\n(Works of Frederick Engels 1884, The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State, to understand how patriarchy, birth, capitalism and abortions are connected). \n\nBasically, the institution of patriarchal family required, as its foundation, the dominance of the man over the woman and the confinement of all property relations within the family / to secure property inheritance within male lineage. As a result, women were confined to roles of childbearing and household labor, making them \"means of production and reproduction\" to sustain family wealth. This structure arose from the value placed on private property and inheritance, creating social control over women\u2019s labor and reproduction. Capitalism later built on this setup, relying on women\u2019s unpaid domestic labor to maintain a steady workforce, reinforcing male dominance and the exploitation of women to sustain the economic system.\n\n\nIn addition:\n\n1) Read leftist theory. Political education IS important to truly grasp what is happening in your society & why and why it obviously affects you and your rights and so on. \n\n2) Join leftist orgs, in particular marxist feminist orgs in your community, if you have none, start forming them! Endless of women who could never rely on the US settler state and its laws  to protect them or aid them, had to rely through history on mutual aid, being part of a community that shows up for eachother and so on. (That includes underground movements). \n\n(Note: I wanted to make a radical marxist feminist platform on discord, meaning anti western imperial, capitalist and choice feminist nonsense - that does not center straight cis men - anyone is interested, hit me up via PM). \n\n3) Organized protests. No, not holding signs and bs - organized worker protests with demands. You will have to connect across your country, decide on the demands you have and walk out. Walk out of your jobs, your roles as mothers, grandmothers, workers. You all have been the shit pacified while not acknowledging that your BIGGEST weapon is the fact that you make half of your society and if you refuse to do labor for a certain period of time - your society is gonna shake. They rely on your free labor, your physical labor, all of it. \n\n4) Divest from men, build and nurture solidarity and community with other women. Think \"xyz dude is cute\", does he give a fuck about your rights? Does he give a fuck about systemic oppression, history and so on? No? Move on. Stop putting your energy into relationships with men who do not even care for your basic human rights. \n\n5) Divest from sex in any form that can get you pregnant. There are endless of other ways to get off. Maybe that will motivate some of the men in your life to actually give a fck? Probably not hmm. Eitherway, less chances to get pregnant. \n\n6) If that is not a sacrifice you want to bring for more safety and you still want to take more risks, copper IUD, hormonal IUD, hormonal implant, tied tubes & expecting the men in your life to step tf up! Keep in mind that even after vasectomies it might not be safe for months & there needs to be a frequent visits to make sure sperm count is in order (plus still use condoms in addition to make sure you are safe). Never center short term convenience and pleasure over your physical safety in a society that will treat you as an incubator and is more than willing to see you dead.\n\n7) Pregnancy strike. I am not sure how any woman is still willing to pop babies... but those ideologies and rules are not only for women who don't want kids. If you want kids you are not automatically \"safe\". It could still get you killed. Consider that. \n\n8) Do not automatically trust your family, partner or doctors or anyone, if you deal with unwanted pregnancy. \n\n9) Don't leave any traces or records online those track your period & could potentially be used to incriminate you.\n\n10) Consider moving to another country if it is something you can afford. \n\n11) Have an emergency fund if that is something you can afford.\n\n12) Train & arm yourself.\n\n13) if you were contemplating divorce - go for it now",

That includes this election too. For example - something like Trump should have never even been a candidate at all, regardless of who is willing to vote for him). \n\nhttps://redsails.org/the-pitfalls-of-liberalism/ (to understand why neoliberals are historically and systemically complicit in that violence).\n\n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1884/origin-family/\n(Works of Frederick Engels 1884, The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State, to understand how patriarchy, birth, capitalism and abortions are connected). \n\nBasically, the institution of patriarchal family required, as its foundation, the dominance of the man over the woman and the confinement of all property relations within the family / to secure property inheritance within male lineage. As a result, women were confined to roles of childbearing and household labor, making them \"means of production and reproduction\" to sustain family wealth. This structure arose from the value placed on private property and inheritance, creating social control over women\u2019s labor and reproduction. Capitalism later built on this setup, relying on women\u2019s unpaid domestic labor to maintain a steady workforce, reinforcing male dominance and the exploitation of women to sustain the economic system.\n\n\nIn addition:\n\n1) Read leftist theory. Political education IS important to truly grasp what is happening in your society & why and why it obviously affects you and your rights and so on. \n\n2) Join leftist orgs, in particular marxist feminist orgs in your community, if you have none, start forming them! Endless of women who could never rely on the US settler state and its laws  to protect them or aid them, had to rely through history on mutual aid, being part of a community that shows up for eachother and so on. (That includes underground movements). \n\n(Note: I wanted to make a radical marxist feminist platform on discord, meaning anti western imperial, capitalist and choice feminist nonsense - that does not center straight cis men - anyone is interested, hit me up via PM). \n\n3) Organized protests. No, not holding signs and bs - organized worker protests with demands. You will have to connect across your country, decide on the demands you have and walk out. Walk out of your jobs, your roles as mothers, grandmothers, workers. You all have been the shit pacified while not acknowledging that your BIGGEST weapon is the fact that you make half of your society and if you refuse to do labor for a certain period of time - your society is gonna shake. They rely on your free labor, your physical labor, all of it. \n\n4) Divest from men, build and nurture solidarity and community with other women. Think \"xyz dude is cute\", does he give a fuck about your rights? Does he give a fuck about systemic oppression, history and so on? No? Move on. Stop putting your energy into relationships with men who do not even care for your basic human rights. \n\n5) Divest from sex in any form that can get you pregnant. There are endless of other ways to get off. Maybe that will motivate some of the men in your life to actually give a fck? Probably not hmm. Eitherway, less chances to get pregnant. \n\n6) If that is not a sacrifice you want to bring for more safety and you still want to take more risks, copper IUD, hormonal IUD, hormonal implant, tied tubes & expecting the men in your life to step tf up! Keep in mind that even after vasectomies it might not be safe for months & there needs to be a frequent visits to make sure sperm count is in order (plus still use condoms in addition to make sure you are safe). Never center short term convenience and pleasure over your physical safety in a society that will treat you as an incubator and is more than willing to see you dead.\n\n7) Pregnancy strike. I am not sure how any woman is still willing to pop babies... but those ideologies and rules are not only for women who don't want kids. If you want kids you are not automatically \"safe\". It could still get you killed. Consider that. \n\n8) Do not automatically trust your family, partner or doctors or anyone, if you deal with unwanted pregnancy. \n\n9) Don't leave any traces or records online those track your period & could potentially be used to incriminate you.\n\n10) Consider moving to another country if it is something you can afford. \n\n11) Have an emergency fund if that is something you can afford.\n\n12) Train & arm yourself.\n\n13) if you were contemplating divorce - go for it now",

Maybe do what you can to help it so guys know that it's sexy and attractive when a guy stands up for causes that back-up female rights. Punishing the a-holes who let this kind of thing happen, while probably what is deserved, might not be enough. Honestly, I think that kind of plays into their feelings of victimhood and they'll just lean into dismissing female rights and concerns even more. Maybe consider making it abundantly clear that there is a positive way forward for them to go if they want relations with women. I don't know, I'm no expert, and I'm genuinely sad that so much of our country is so comfortable with women being treated with disrespect and as less than.

How you live your sexuality should always be your choice and it shouldn't necessarily be political. That's kind of my point. My point is that sexuality is personal and human and important and it's 1) unreasonable to demand that all women go on \"sex strike\" and 2) the idea of a \"sex strike\" carries some implications that imo are pretty misogynist and backwards and that echo the lies incels/religious conservatives believe about women, our sexuality, and our role in relationships.\n\nTake care of yourself <3",

My point is that it's unreasonable to expect that all heterosexual women will make that choice and that they're either gender traitors or idiots if they do continue to date, sleep with, love, and have kids with men. \n\nI think it's totally reasonable if individual women decide, for themselves, that they don't want anything to do with men. If I wasn't already in a great relationship, I would not be looking for one right now. My point is that calling for a blanket ban is not calling for choice, and that the idea of a \"sex strike\" carries some gross implications about women's sexuality that mirror misogynist ideas spouted by religious conservatives and incels.\n\nWhatever you choose, whoever you are, I wish you as much safety as possible in this objectively awful time <3",
         "I feel like you misunderstod my post. I'm not saying women shouldn't withhold sex \"to avoid looking like prudes.\" I really don't care about how men perceive us. I care about our side and what the idea of a sex ban implies for women.\n\nI'm saying that expecting women to \"withhold sex\" assumes that sex \u2014 and romantic love, more importantly \u2014 is something most of can and should be expected to cut out of our lives. To me, this idea echoes the sexist thought you see in conservative religious and incel spaces that women have this cool detachment from sex \u2014 that we aren't sexual creatures  like men are, that we can just decide to be \"\"\"pure\"\"\" and celibate without losing something important about ourselves and our humanity. That sex isn't a part of our humanity. Sex isn't just about fun. It is about love. And love is part of our humanity. \n\nPersonally, I can't give that up.  I can't give up love, and I won't. I love my partner, he loves me. He's as torn up \u2014\u00a0if not more \u2014\u00a0about what's happening than I am. He isn't the problem. A lot of individual men aren't the problem. I have a lot of rage at men as a class, but I don't hate the individual men I know who are good allies now just because they're men.\n\nDo I think women should be in partnerships with men who don't respect their humanity and who vote and act against their rights? Absolutely not. Do I think women should consider very carefully who they get into relationships with and effecitvely trust with their lives? Yes. I just find the idea of a blanket ban on heterosexuality pretty ridiculous.  \n\nI definitely have empathy. I wouldn't have kids in the US right now. But I understand that some women will still choose to risk their lives having kids *because the risk is personally worth it to them \u2014* and yes, some women already willingly do this already, i.e. people choosing to go forward with risky multiples pregnancies and other high-risk pregnancies. I don't see those women as gender traitors. I see them as sisters who made a choice I wouldn't. And I empathize with women who feel they cannot be in any relationship with any man right now. I just would hope that those women would extend the same empathy to their sisters who cannot or will not make the same choice. \n\nI hope that's a bit clearer.",

One of these vague but punitive unacceptable things negates a hundred acceptable things.\n\nThe wife should have no life except to give birth over and over bc it\u2019s her DUTY. \n\nThen she should hand over those children as cannon fodder for Uncle Sam bc it\u2019s their DUTY. \n\nThe husband should control literally everything simply by right of being male and he should have a stomach full of bleeding ulcers rather than cry bc it\u2019s his DUTY.",

         "It sounds super boring sounding, but if you have any women's clubs in your area, like the historic kind that have been around for a century, it's worth the yearly dues. The one where I am has been functioning since 1920 and has all the history of how they made change under those conditions. It's such an old club, if you look at old yearbooks with their board members they're listed as Mrs. (Husband's full name). It was a club entirely of women and they weren't even allowed their own first names on their own literature. And yet they were still able to make differences. \n\nThese clubs are often older ladies who just do stuff like crocheting, gardening, 5k walks for breast cancer, etc. So it might not sound fun, but these women can have 50+ years of experience of helping the women of their community. They've had careers long enough to either be in high ranking positions at companies or still have contacts there. Many know local politicians personally. They have such a community mindset and will help you with a lot.\n\n It might seem like it's not the place for younger people, but they get ecstatic when young people show up. Used to be, many of the members were young, but now not so much. When they see younger people they immediately try to convince them to help with the organization in serious ways. It's not like some other orgs where all you can do is just volunteer to answer the phones. They want their club to continue into the next generation and they want to adapt to the times. They need help with social media, making marketing materials, organizing spreadsheets, converting PDFs etc. It could be a good way to help out in your community and give yourself something to keep your mind occupied. \n\nThey're not allowed to be officially political due to their nonprofit status or something, but my club is full of individual women who have spent the last several months doing phone banks, canvassing, sending out postcards, etc. They recently went to NC and had a network of people that provided them with free rooms while they were there campaigning. Not saying you have to campaign or anything, but it was cool seeing how often one of them would say \"I know a person in ___ they can help us out with this.\" I've never seen networking like this group has. \n\nMost importantly, I think just the community is worth it. Even if you're not actually out there \"making a difference\".  They do book clubs, monthly hang outs, tea time, etc. where they just hang out and don't talk about organization stuff. They hardly ever center men in any of their discussions, they're relatively drama free. And the drama they do have isn't dire, it's just stuff like getting heated over which book they're going to read. It's so nice being able to sit down in a safe space full of women who genuinely care about you and each other, without anxiety or stress, even if it's only one day a month. Plus, older ladies are hilarious. \n\nIdk if you've got one of these clubs in your area, but usually there's something similar somewhere if you live in any decent sized town. I put off trying this club for a long time cause of the yearly payment and the older population, and instead tried the local homeless shelter, the local pride center, the local women's shelter, and none of those orgs made me feel like I was really making a difference. I didn't build any helpful connections, and all the people in charge were so focused on being seen as in charge that they weren't fun to be around. These sweet old ladies have made me feel so welcome and I've seen them do more tangible good for the local community than any other group.",

Will there be more death\u2019s in the war/occupation or Ukraine in Gaza than there would have already been if Harris or almost anyone else had got into office?\n\nWe had a brief reprieve from darkness in the past and we will surely be facing darkness in the future. The best thing we can do now is try to support each other. It\u2019s still going to be dark though.",
         "I am mourning the future I had been building for myself. The one where I live modestly, yet independently, sewing and designing and being creatively fulfilled. Where my niece would grow up with the same opportunities that I had, and more. Where I would happily work my interesting remote desk job to pay the bills and I have enough. My aging parents cared for safely. \n\nIt\u2019s gone. It\u2019s all gone. I don\u2019t get to have that life anymore. I am so fucking tired.",
         "Well, women have been dying from abortion bans and it will get much much much worse. Include that with people who will no longer have the ACA, the mass deportations, and trans violence, there will be much worse. We need to prepare for it and do what we can. It will be bad though.",
         "I feel the same way. I also feel dead inside. The thought of enduring this feeling for 4 years and beyond in the aftermath is beyond draining. The last time I grieved someone I was so tired all the time.",
         "I'm Canadian and taking this harder than any family member I've lost. It's natural that you're eventually going to lose people, people die, that's just a fact of life, but people deciding to vote for someone like Donald Trump, especially after the last decade, that's not normal and it just kills me and I can't help but think how truly despicable humans truly are deep down.",
         "My mom has terminal brain cancer. Finding out about the results this morning felt almost exactly how it felt the day I learned she had a brain tumor. Absolute terror. I\u2019m so sorry this is happening.\u00a0",
         "My mom has turned into someone I don\u2019t recognize. She wasn\u2019t particularly loving when I was a child, but now she is like an acquaintance. Watching and listening to Kamala made me see what a beautiful maternal love should look like. I\u2019m so profoundly heartbroken today.",
         "I found myself thinking the same this morning. It's not as bad as my sibling passing a couple of years ago, but it's near enough. All day today I've been in the same numb/brain dead feel I had off and on back then. \n\nI'm letting myself grieve today. Giving myself a day from my task list, stayed in bed a little longer, ate that last bit of ice cream, having that beer. Going to read a new book I got here soon. Self-care. \n\nAnd now that the work day is done, tearing up, too. Especially since today I'm scared for my job that I love so much; it could be gone soon and it's the only non-food job I've known. \n\nLike those years ago, I'm deeply saddened and scared for the unknown future.",
         "There's a scene in my favorite science fiction show where a character talks about the grief her feels over losing a place: in his case, his home planet.\n\nI've been thinking about that scene a lot today. I feel like it's really hit home that this country never has been a place of liberty and justice, and it never will be. And I'm grieving over that idea.",
         "I went out with my husband for lunch just to get out of the house so I didn\u2019t stew in my thoughts of What just happened??  I am angry and sad just like you.  I fear for future women and my grandchildren.  Only thing we can do is take a deep breath and fight this.  Next voting period ..vote all blue again.  \n\nI am fortunate that my husband is moderate like me and believe women should have rights.  They should be treated as equals.  However, conservatives live in the past and see women as just behind a man cooking in the kitchen as well as doing house chores.  It is sad that the US still hasn\u2019t evolved from this rhetoric.  \n\nHugs to all women in here.  We are not alone. \ud83e\udd79",

         "\"For the future of the economy\"\n\nCan't wait to see their Pikachu faces when that is also thrown violently to the trash.\n\nOur rights have been sacrificed for nothing. You grieve and despair because someone else has sacrificed you, and double insult they sacrificed you for nothing.",
         "I'm not from the US, but I feel somewhat the same way. Maybe it's the death of an ideal, an ideal that I had grown up believing in. That good and decency will always prevail. I used to dream of moving to America. My own country is regressing in a similar way and progressives barely scraped by in the last election and not without having to form a coalition with the very villains that we all came out in force to vote and overthrow. For me, the US seems to have 'fallen' in a sense. Many more ugly things will be coming out of the woodwork in the years to come, emboldened by the turnout of this election.\n\nI'm sorry, women of America. Hugs from SEA.",
         "That\u2019s hope",
         "Oh it\u2019s far worst that you can imagine. He and Musk are going to take the reins on the most powerful weapon humanity has ever created. Yes we are indeed in a terrible position.",
         "I have been saying the same. My reaction was the exact same as to when someone in my life has died- it\u2019s such an ambiguous grief and it\u2019s hard to know what to do with it.",
         "SciAm just ran a worthwhile piece about Election Grief. [Election Grief is Real, Here's How to Cope](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/election-grief-is-real-heres-how-to-cope/)",
         "I am so sorry. Mothers are irreplaceable, and democracy is so much more delicate than we thought. You are very kind to offer solace to others.",
         "I'm from the UK. Yes, we see you. And we know you will keep fighting, because you're good people - so there IS hope. Love to you.",
         "Decency! How was his physically mocking a disabled person not a complete disqualifier? What kind of monsters cosign that? It's incomprehensible.",
         "Technically more women will be unable to access life-saving abortions. \n\nZygotes are going to be treated with more dignity.",
         "I've had moments today where I just... can't. Can't function. Can't think. I just... sit and am nothing. Can't think. Just..sit.\n\nI'm so worried for my kids. For my friends for myself.\n\nIt's like a part of me did die. One that believes Americans care about each other more than they hate.",
         "Fitting. It's one of my favorites and I like Concrete Blonde's version of it too.",
         "I'm so sorry that chain of events happened to you. I hope you have lots of support around you now.",
         "Yeah, women aren\u2019t allowed to be president. They will never have a woman candidate again because women just lose. Men can be president no matter their race or their crimes or their stupidity, but no woman is allowed, no matter her race or experience or skill. Thats the message, loud and clear.",
         "Today we mourn. Tomorrow we fight. And they day after that...until freedom is truly ours.",
         "I existential crisis burritoed most of the morning.\n\nThen I did some despair cleaning.\n\nI'm now at the watch silly Asian drama stage.\n\nI'll probably go to bed early and crisis burrito myself to sleep.",
         "I'm on my angry phase now. I'm ready to kick some ass. If only I had someones ass to kick. \n\nMy husband is a progressive so he feels the same way about it, though less depressed about it than I am, says he saw it coming from his interaction with people at work, Women fought to hard to get here to lose anymore rights to the right.",
         "Thank you. On the one hand, I\u2019m glad she\u2019s not alive to see this. On the other hand, I\u2019ve spent the entire day wishing I could just call my mom.",
         "Thank you for this. It's all such a bleak, isolating feeling.",
         "And for what it\u2019s worth, the Cheeto won 2/3 elections. The one he lost was to a man.",
         "I have also crisis burritoed, even with the help of (legally prescribed) Valium, I'm still a complete wreck.\n\nWeeping off and on all day.\n\nStarted weeping again because I just got a call (that I would normally never answer) from my literal convicted rapist, former White Power, swastika tattoo having, one time Aryan Brotherhood, Uncle. To my surprise, he voted for Kamala and my other uncles didn't. He apparently read them the riot act and they got very pissed off. He was crying on the phone to me, and he said that he doesn't think he can believe in God anymore.\n\nWhen he's a voice of reason in my family, I don't know what to fucking think.",
         "Understood. It's new and raw. Women around the world are concerned for you, because your troubles are, or soon could be, ours too. Personally, I wanted to slap our Prime Minister when he was one of the first to congratulate Trump! That aside, I'm old now, and remember when women had fewer rights than farm animals. We survived and thrived. We're still doing it. While I wouldn't presume to understand your political system, I do know that I learned in school that your Constitution begins with the beautiful words \" We The People\". That's you. You're enough - and you are not alone."

      "text": "My daughter and I are very close and she has never really wanted kids. She isn\u2019t built for them. She would make a phenomenal Aunt to her brother\u2019s future children but she is adamant that she does not want any children of her own, and has felt this way for as long as I can remember.  If she does want children in the future there is always adoption. \n\nThere so many different kinds of families and I want her to have the family she wants. \n\nTo be completely honest I did grieve just a little that she would never experience the \u201cjoy\u201d of being pregnant or giving birth. But then I realized that, that was something that gave ME joy and it would probably be her worst nightmare.  \n\nI will hold her hand, I will help her to do this. I am so proud of who she is and the decisions she is making for her life. I will always try to be the mother she needs. I love her how could I do less? ",

         "You're a good mom. \n\n\nI haven't told my parents that I'm getting a bilateral salpingectomy next Thursday. I'm not sure how they will react. \n\n\nGood on your for putting your feelings aside and supporting your kid. Good job!",
         "Thank you for supporting your daughter\u2019s right to choose. Many childfree individuals have completely unsupportive parents, I\u2019m sure it means a lot to your daughter.",
         "Well adoption isn't always that easy, I mean to even be allowed to adopt. She's only 23 so why the need to rush with tubal ligation if there could be a possibility she wants children in the future. But good of her supporting what ever her choice is.",
         "I was 24 when I had my bilateral salpingectomy. I had known since early childhoood that I never wished to be pregnant or give birth. \n\nI had NO support. I had to beg my ex-boyfriend to drive me to and from the hospital the day of my surgery, I recovered entirely on my own. I\u2019m very grateful I have zero complications. \n\nSharing information with her daughter, showing that she is supportive of whatever her daughter decides when she decides for herself, is so great. It leaves the door open, so that in the future her daughter isn\u2019t going through surgery alone and unsupported.",
         "Meh idk. My daughter\u2019s friend fostered and eventually adopted as a single woman of 25."
