I just don\u2019t understand how many people in my country have been brainwashed to the point of voting against their own interests\u2026 How the hell did we get here? ",

         "I was cautiously optimistic earlier and I am just... devastated right now. I knew it'd be close but I just had a tiny glimmer of hope that MAYBE it would not be like this.\n\nI just don't get it? people are looking at Trump, a convicted felon, a violent instigator of an insurrection, a man who has admitted he'd be a dictator and has threatened political violence on people, an ACTUAL RAPIST, and they're like, \"oh yea I can vote for that!\" Or, they ignore it because \"the economy is bad\" like they haven't been paying enough attention to see that Trump's plans are going to actively harm them?\n\nHOW IS THIS HAPPENING??? How are we here again??? I feel so sorry for us, for us women, for us as a country. We owe ALL those women who have died after not receiving the healthcare they need better. I'm sorry we failed them.",
         "I really didn\u2019t want to get my hopes up. But I believed that things were different this time. I thought January 6 changed people\u2019s minds. I thought women dying from being unable to access healthcare changed people\u2019s minds. And Harris was such a promising candidate, with experience and charisma - I thought people would turn out for her and her vision. I am so sick thinking of the next four years, and the lasting consequences for our nation.",
         "[removed]",
         "Yes. I mean...I'm so dumbfounded how people are so blind. Trump has made it VERY easy to want to vote against. The things he says, the dumb things he says, all the legal evidence, recorded evidence, the way his followers act, the bullying they use as a political leg to stand on...how how do people see all this and still say...yeah he's better than Harris. If it really comes down to they rather have any man than a woman...then wow...",
         "HOW IS IT HAPPENING AGAIN for fucks sake",
         "No panic. Just totally devoid of hope. Like, properly hopeless, like I don't think I have ever been in my life; and I am nearly 50.\n\nThere's no coming back from this.",
         "I\u2019m not American and watching as an outsider but I\u2019m honestly baffled that it was allowed to get to this point. That a convicted felon could run for president. \n\nThis election truly shows that a lot of Americans would rather anyone else as president, even if that person is an absolute buffoon, than a lot more capable woman of colour. Disgusting. \n\nAnd while I despair for any minorities in America right now, I also worry that morons here in Australia (and there\u2019s a lot of them) will want to follow the US\u2019s example. We should be moving forward in 2025, not backwards..",
         "Yes. This is worse than 2016",
         "It continues to become more and more clear that women in America will never be seen as equal to men. Not equal enough to make laws about our own bodies. Not equal enough to be in the executive leadership office. It\u2019s so disheartening that the past 4 years of change will be rolled back and we\u2019ll continue to lose so much of the progress we\u2019ve made over decades.",
         "I knew it. Everyone said it would be fine but I knew everyone hated women.",
         "The real fear is knowing that with how much they hate us and how terrifyingly large their numbers are, even if we win, he will have his little army rioting. We are not safe. He has planed to make sure of that.\u00a0",
         "I'm just sitting here crying. I honestly don't know what to do. If he wins, there will be no safe states to go to anymore. And it's not just abortion care, it's education, it's birth control, it's no'fault divorce. All of it - gone.",
         "My parents, too. They don't care. They said it themselves. They told me they don't give a fuck\nThey never have. They care more about politics than about me and I feel numb",
         "Why is this so fucking close?  \n\nWhat the actual fuck America?",
         "We're on a long-term project.  More determined than ever - I will never stop fighting the misogyny, never stop remembering the women they force to die needlessly, never end the quest for a woman's sole right to decide until it has been restored to every woman in America.",
         "I\u2019m sick and speechless. This country despises women",
         "I\u2019m putting in PTO tomorrow because I need a day to mourn the loss of the children I\u2019ll never have. \n\nI\u2019m in Texas and we really, really needed Ted Cruz to lose. He did not lose.",
         "Watching from New Zealand. I just can't believe that there is even a choice between the two. A conman, ra@pest etc etc etc. And a smart, experienced, person who has a plan that will uplift people, get people healthcare, and a long list of sound policies. \n\nMy heart breaks for you.",
         "Trump literally almost bankrupted my grandparents family run construction business by not paying them for their work. My uncle (their child) who lives in Georgia has still voted for him 3 times. People are idiots.\u00a0",
         "I\u2019m in Canada and feeling so scared for everyone in this world",
         "My husband is upstairs playing his video game and I'm downstairs on the couch bawling my eyes out doomscrolling Reddit. I hate this. I hate this so much.",
         "This is so fucking disheartening. Normally, a presidential race isn't as important as this. But the winner will be able to appoint 2 more supreme court justices, and it's looking more and more like it will be Trump. Which means I have less hope today for my daughter's future than I did when she was born.\n\nHillary should've won in 2016, Kamala should win this time, but our society is so misogynistic, that they won't vote for a woman. IE, polling numbers are showing Trump went from 10% black male voter support, to 25% this election, and if he wins that's the difference. Along with, a large gain in Latino voters (which I just don't understand, he's constantly attacking them)",
         "I keep seeing people say \u201cwhy didn\u2019t we pick a more likable woman? Didn\u2019t we learn anything from Hilary?\u201d Or maybe we just hate women and no woman candidate would be likable to the general population?",
         "I feel rage, despair, and then numbness. Then repeat.\n\nI just want to say to anyone who feels the same that you are not alone. There are millions of us and we will rise up.",
         "I think I had too much faith in other Americans prior to this election. I can\u2019t believe what I\u2019m seeing.",
         "I made the mistake of messaging my sister for solidarity and comfort, to discover that she is indifferent and of the camp \"they were both bad options.\" Glad I have this thread as a group hug",
         "Terrified, sick, and disgusted. Honestly feels like men really do hate us.",
         "I don\u2019t know if or how I\u2019ll live through this.",
         "From the UK, I am so sad for you. It's not just places like Afghanistan that are misogynistic, the US has deeply ingrained racism and misogyny, and I am so sad for the world to hear the results as they're coming in.",
         "America hates women more than it hates Trump.",
         "A lot of Americans are going to be sorry about something in the near future (I already am,) but I doubt that any who voted for the buffoon will ever connect the dots and realize it\u2019s because of something _they_ did.\n\nI (76M) have seen some shit in my life, but this shit outshines all previous shit. Take care of yourselves, ladies, and take care of each other. You may someday soon be all you\u2019ve got.",
         "People are now coming out and saying they supported Trump silently but never vocalized it for fear of being shamed.\n\nI don\u2019t know who to trust anymore, or how to lead with trust and openness. Part of me just\u2026broke tonight.\n\nTrump\u2019s horrific enough, but they\u2019re going to slap him with the 25th Amendment and institute their Christofascist regime in the blink of an eye. This will be the end of everything.",
         "I'm ashamed of my country right now, and I don't want to have anything to do with any of the men in it. Fuck this.",
         "I'm terrified for my wife. We just had a loss and luckily no major complications but we live in an abortion ban state and the possibilities fucking haunt me. And as badly as we want a daughter I cannot imagine having to raise her in a world where Project 2025 is taking effect.\n\nWomen deserve better and this country has failed them again.",
         "I\u2019m in the middle of IVF. I just turned 40. It was already risky but now I\u2019m fucking terrified. I hemorrhaged during a D&C for a miscarriage, things can go wrong so quickly. The only glimmer of hope is that I\u2019m in a very blue state and the leading governor candidate is the current state AG that successfully sued Trump over and over and over.",
         "Angry. Scared. Heartbroken. Numb. \n\nMost of all I keep wondering, what am I going to do to tell my kids if we lose? How can I look at my elementary aged daughter and tell her the country voted that she deserves less rights than I\u2019ve had? How do I tell my son that I\u2019m so sorry but the good guys don\u2019t always win\u2026",
         "I can\u2019t sleep, I\u2019m so fucking scared. Sexism and racism are going to end democracy. How the hell am I supposed to keep my daughter safe?!",
         "I am very frightened. I am disabled and can\u2019t work. I rely on SSDI to survive and maintain independence. What happens to me under Project 2025? What happens to my SSDI? And then, what about my rights as an individual as a woman? What about my mom and my sister and my young nieces? So much is at stake and I am scared. I can\u2019t live through another Trump term. I just can\u2019t. But I am disabled and no other country will want me. I never got a college education because of my disability and my work history is spotty at best because of it. Nowhere else will want me. I am trapped.",
         "Trump set us so far back with a single term - climate, human (women\u2019s especially) rights, foreign relations, you name it. And in that term, he had a divided Congress, did not yet have a Supreme Court supermajority, and most importantly, did not yet understand the government apparatus, and was surrounded by Republicans who, while I disagreed with them, at least had enough integrity to put country over party and check his worst impulses. \n\nLiterally all of that is gone now. It\u2019s looking like both halves of Congress will be Republican, the Supreme Court remains 6-3, and he\u2019s replaced anyone disagreeing with him with yes men. And plans to displace subject matter experts with his own appointees across all of our regulatory agencies. The guardrails are truly broken. \n\nI honestly don\u2019t know how we come back from this. The damage of the next four years may be irreparable. Democracies like Ukraine and Taiwan in other parts of the world will fall to other strongman types like Xi and Putin. Trump may even help them do it. And what\u2019s left of Gaza will be newly leveled with US dollars funding all of it. Finally, here at home, we may not ever get to vote again, if Trump\u2019s own statements are to be believed. \n\nI fear for my wife, for my daughter, for all of us, and for the entire world.",
         "I cried for like 5 minutes and got mad at myself for even being surprised anymore. A Trump presidency likely won\u2019t even affect me personally. I\u2019m a straight white woman in a blue state, can\u2019t have babies, make a decent salary and don\u2019t require assistance. But if you have just a drop of decency and empathy you\u2019d vote democrat this election. \n\nI can\u2019t even imagine being a poc, or a trans person or having a school-age child in a public school or being an immigrant or living in a red state. I am so sad and scared for the people that this will have consequences for. And I\u2019m so disgusted by this country, the men, but I am completely appalled with the women who voted for him because they should know better. I\u2019m just so disappointed in fellow Americans and I\u2019m embarrassed for us",

         "57% of florida voted to enshrine abortion rights (and lost the measure, cause it needed 60%).  Yet many of those same dumbshits decided to vote in president cheeto for a 2nd round.  I can't even with the double think on this one.",
         "I'm fucking disgusted at young men. Gains all across the board. People really think their stupid fucking pocketbook is a greater priority than the rights and dignity of actual people. Fuck this.",
         "I\u2019ll have a masters in healthcare next year. If Trump wins I\u2019m hoping that\u2019s enough to get me somewhere out of this country with my family.",

         "Well, I'm done humanity. Fuck this.",
         "I hate that two smart, accomplished, extremely experienced women lost to him. I fucking hate it. This country isn't ready for a woman president. Feels like it's 1960 instead of 2024. I feel numb mostly. I want to go to sleep and wake up in 4 years.",
         "Not great, my hands are shaking from anxiety. I had a bit of hope going into today from the Selzer poll. Devastated.",

         "Yes, I am literally crying",

         "I have lupus and have such high Healthcare costs. No one is going to insure me and i can't afford my medications and visits it would be more than I make in a year. Multiple years.

         "I feel the same. As a woman, a mother to daughters, someone who works in healthcare, and the parent to a chronically ill child, I am so discouraged and disappointed. How did we get back here?",
         "It's unbelievable that we are doing this twice. How fucking stupid are the stupids?",
         "If Republicans sweep the house, senate and presidency, there is no hope.",
         "This election has made me realize how stupid people really are. And unfortunately, stupid people en masse are ridiculously powerful. \n\nSmart people are smart enough to weigh the options, look at all the pros and cons and select carefully.\n\nStupid people don't care, if someone puts enough glitz and glamor in their face, they dont care about facts and real life, they'll vote for glitz and glamor. And of course when the glamor dies and the curtain is pulled back to reveal death, they wanna act shocked, clutch their pearls, and still blame everyone but the flashy criminal that sold them lies.",
         "God, imagine having the means, the wealth, the economy, the importance, the sheer power of a country like the US, enabling you to become the safest and most wonderful country for people to live in, and making it into a third fucking world country where anyone who isn't a white male republican doesn't feel human. \n\nI'm watching from the Netherlands and I honestly cannot fathom this is happening again. My heart is with you.",
         "I know a woman who is married to another woman and has a plethora of girls through IVF and .. is voting for Trump. I don\u2019t understand it",

         "Truthfully, I was hopefully she\u2019d win but was upset that it could be close. I didn\u2019t think it\u2019d be a fucking landslide in his favor. I\u2019ve sobbed so much tonight. My head hurts, my eyes hurt, and I haven\u2019t begun to grapple with the reality of a future in this country now. People think I\u2019m being hyperbolic, but y\u2019all - I think we\u2019re doomed. I hope I\u2019m wrong but I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m not.",

Well until today.\n\n2016 destroyed me and I can't even put into words how devastated I am at the turnout today. \n\nAmerica has failed us. The men in our lives have failed us. Once again, we fall victim to ignorance and lack of civic education while we trample over the rights of the marginalized and those who need protection the most. \n\nWe voted in project 2025. We voted in a conservative super majority on the Supreme Court that WILL strip away all the rights our ancestors fought for.",
         "Mankind is so fucked. I am at a loss. It feels like my whole life is over, just knowing what they have planned for the future. Fuck these fucks who hate women and POC",

         "I am not part of this. I did everything I possibly could to prevent this future for my daughter. I voted, I canvassed and volunteered, I encouraged others to vote and drove some friends. But we are stuck here and I\u2019m not sure how bad things are going to get. I\u2019m very worried.",

         "This is scary even for someone living in the UK. I honestly can\u2019t understand the situation. Is it an education issue? Are people that racist in the US? Don\u2019t voters understand the damage he can do? Do they believe he hasn\u2019t done anything wrong and it was all made up? It\u2019s beyond comprehension really.",
         "I don't think there's any hope for the country if this is what more than half of it is saying. The only explanation I can come up with is a lack of education or poor education. I guess it makes sense to that the US couldn't be a model of freedom forever.",

People wrote off that one as an instance where \u201cBernie got royally screwed\u201d because the most misogynist people can never admit the existence of a completely different standard. Biden beat Trump because he was an elderly white man, so it was grandpa vs. grandpa. US voters are ignorant religious fanatics who hate women, and have built an entire mythos around blaming women. Fuck them, and fuck trying to court their votes in the future.",

This amendment does not change the Legislature's constitutional authority to require notification to a parent or guardian before a minor has an abortion.\n\n*The proposed amendment would result in significantly more abortions and fewer live births per year in Florida.  The increase in abortions could be even greater if the amendment invalidates laws requiring parental consent before minors undergo abortions and those ensuring only licensed physicians perform abortions.  There is also uncertainty about whether the amendment will require the state to subsidize abortions with public funds.  Litigation to resolve those and other uncertainties will result in additional costs to the state budget.  An increase in abortions may negatively affect the growth of the state budget.  An increase in abortions may negatively affect the growth of state and local revenues over time.  Because the fiscal impact of increased abortions on state and local revenues and costs cannot be estimated with precision, the total impact of the proposed amendment is indeterminate.*  **THE FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THIS AMEMENDMENT CANNOT BE DETERMINED DUE TO AMBIGUITIES AND UNCERTAINTIES SURROUNDING THE AMENDMENT'S IMPACT.\"** The bolded and capitalized words are theirs; italics are mine.\n\n  \nThis was not written on a prolife pamphlet, it wasn't a Republican anti-abortion ad.  It was on the goddamn *voting ballot.*  A supposed nonpartisan document that is supposed to provide unbiased information about an amendment.

This is surprising given how much of the narrative has been saying that this election is about reproductive rights.\n\nIn fact, Trump\u2019s vote is proportionally up in pretty much every demographic except two: college-educated *men*, and those aged 65+. Those two groups are voting more for Harris than they did for Biden. Every other group has swung towards Trump. I don\u2019t think many saw that coming.\n\nOf course due to the nature of the electoral college this doesn\u2019t necessarily mean anything in terms of the result - it\u2019s really going to come down to how PA, MI and WI vote.

Trump and his likely control of all three branches of government will strip us of social rights, create an economy where we\u2019re all competing with each other for jobs that don\u2019t cover our needs, and for POC/women/LGBT+ people will likely make sure we have no protection from discrimination and can more easily lose our jobs.

It\u2019s a good gauge for the general support of a candidate, but not necessarily indicative of who will win.\n\nThat said, 3rd party votes matter so so so much. Look at Pennsylvania. In Erie county PA the difference between DT and KH was about 1900 votes. Stein and the Libertarian candidate made up about 1240 votes and about 300 were write-ins. So, had those votes instead gone to KH, or not voted at all, the difference would be just over 300 votes. That\u2019s like, a movie theater full of people. That\u2019s it.\n\nAnd that happened/is happening all across the state, and other states with high electoral values.

I remember Kamala having something like a 1% approval rating when she was running against Biden in the primaries for 2020.\n\nThis is happening because the Dems fucked the selection process, like they did against Bernie.\n\nI think Kamala not condemning a genocide, and trying to cosy with NeoCons is what cost her the most votes, and not being negative enough about the Republicans. The \"wierdo\" ads were really effective. Who likes the NeoCons? How many votes would you gain from them?\n\nI don't think Trump won as much as the Dems lost.\n\nYour country is gonna be a disaster now.

Now, we know that this inflation was (a) less than in many other countries and (b) a direct result of the stimulus to avoid crashing the economy during the pandemic, but these complex arguments are not swaying the low-information, disengaged voter.\n\n(3) Kamala inherited (from Biden) the pandemic lockdowns and many low-information voters were angry that they couldn't move around as they might like.\n\n(4) Kamala only did 10-or-so major interviews, preferring to spend her time on the campaign trail doing rallies. This prevented people from seeing her respond to different questions and becoming familiar with her. Psychology repeatedly shows that people will choose someone whose name they recognize and who they feel familiar with EVEN IF they hate this person rather than a person that they don't feel that they know. One of the things that Obama made sure to do (and Trump also did) was heavily engage with both legacy media interviewers and social media interviewers that could create the sense of familiarity and allow the candidate to field more nuanced and individualistic questions.\n\n(5) Psychological studies have also shown that \"protecting democracy\" is actually not a very compelling argument for low-information voters, most of whom don't understand how democracy works and generally dislike the idea of governmental negotiations taking time and resulting in compromised outcomes. These people prefer an authoritarian who can \"get things done\" rather than this more consultative process. Additionally, since they are not political, they don't actually worry about the \"high-minded\" political issues but care more about tangible changes in their lives. (It's the \"Is your life now better than 4 years ago?\" question.)\n\n(6) On the other end of the spectrum, many more politically-astute voters were waiting to hear more details on Kamala's policies, especially since they diverged so strongly from her positions in 2020. She did not clarify why she flipped on these positions. So, it meant that when she spoke about women's rights (for example), she sounded genuine -- since she has consistently held this position -- and when she spoke about foreign policy (for example), she sounded like a pre-programmed soundbyte machine -- since her foreign policy position changed significantly sicne 2020.",

That includes this election too. For example - something like Trump should have never even been a candidate at all, regardless of who is willing to vote for him). \n\nhttps://redsails.org/the-pitfalls-of-liberalism/ (to understand why neoliberals are historically and systemically complicit in that violence).\n\n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1884/origin-family/\n(Works of Frederick Engels 1884, The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State, to understand how patriarchy, birth, capitalism and abortions are connected). \n\nBasically, the institution of patriarchal family required, as its foundation, the dominance of the man over the woman and the confinement of all property relations within the family / to secure property inheritance within male lineage. As a result, women were confined to roles of childbearing and household labor, making them \"means of production and reproduction\" to sustain family wealth. This structure arose from the value placed on private property and inheritance, creating social control over women\u2019s labor and reproduction. Capitalism later built on this setup, relying on women\u2019s unpaid domestic labor to maintain a steady workforce, reinforcing male dominance and the exploitation of women to sustain the economic system.\n\n\nIn addition:\n\n1) Read leftist theory. Political education IS important to truly grasp what is happening in your society & why and why it obviously affects you and your rights and so on. \n\n2) Join leftist orgs, in particular marxist feminist orgs in your community, if you have none, start forming them! Endless of women who could never rely on the US settler state and its laws  to protect them or aid them, had to rely through history on mutual aid, being part of a community that shows up for eachother and so on. (That includes underground movements). \n\n(Note: I wanted to make a radical marxist feminist platform on discord, meaning anti western imperial, capitalist and choice feminist nonsense - that does not center straight cis men - anyone is interested, hit me up via PM). \n\n3) Organized protests. No, not holding signs and bs - organized worker protests with demands. You will have to connect across your country, decide on the demands you have and walk out. Walk out of your jobs, your roles as mothers, grandmothers, workers. You all have been the shit pacified while not acknowledging that your BIGGEST weapon is the fact that you make half of your society and if you refuse to do labor for a certain period of time - your society is gonna shake. They rely on your free labor, your physical labor, all of it. \n\n4) Divest from men, build and nurture solidarity and community with other women. Think \"xyz dude is cute\", does he give a fuck about your rights? Does he give a fuck about systemic oppression, history and so on? No? Move on. Stop putting your energy into relationships with men who do not even care for your basic human rights. \n\n5) Divest from sex in any form that can get you pregnant. There are endless of other ways to get off. Maybe that will motivate some of the men in your life to actually give a fck? Probably not hmm. Eitherway, less chances to get pregnant. \n\n6) If that is not a sacrifice you want to bring for more safety and you still want to take more risks, copper IUD, hormonal IUD, hormonal implant, tied tubes & expecting the men in your life to step tf up! Keep in mind that even after vasectomies it might not be safe for months & there needs to be a frequent visits to make sure sperm count is in order (plus still use condoms in addition to make sure you are safe). Never center short term convenience and pleasure over your physical safety in a society that will treat you as an incubator and is more than willing to see you dead.\n\n7) Pregnancy strike. I am not sure how any woman is still willing to pop babies... but those ideologies and rules are not only for women who don't want kids. If you want kids you are not automatically \"safe\". It could still get you killed. Consider that. \n\n8) Do not automatically trust your family, partner or doctors or anyone, if you deal with unwanted pregnancy. \n\n9) Don't leave any traces or records online those track your period & could potentially be used to incriminate you.\n\n10) Consider moving to another country if it is something you can afford. \n\n11) Have an emergency fund if that is something you can afford.\n\n12) Train & arm yourself.",

Because laws that let them casually rip open communications and target *whoever* are useful.\n\nThe \"schemes\" (proposals by some unelected nutjobs) could be easily defeated. All it would take is for Dems and the anti-religious nutjob republicans to refuse to pass annual budget appropriations. DOJ can't be weaponized if they're willing to defund it.\n\nName the last *serious* effort by the DNC to enshrine abortion rights.\n\nThey're two halves of the same broken system. And the Dems fired the second woman Surgeon General because she dared to speak out against abstinence-only education. Because the party was *also* courting religious fundies.\n\nI *trust* the US military not to be involved in a fascist plunge to hell. I can't say the same for the various agencies or local police. And universal acceptance that police, given orders, are fucking immune from prosecution? That is *by definition*, fascism. The fact they haven't wielded the baton too blatantly doesn't absolve anyone from putting the tools of fascism in place, renewing them, or refusing to table proposals to kill off the old ones.",

Being autistic and constantly abused for it, I never had the luxury in believing that most people are even halfway decent. In 2016, I learned just how depraved many of my fellow citizens are. And so when I was diagnosed, a mere few weeks after Roe fell, I was *relieved*. I saw this coming, so I skipped the less invasive treatment options and had my uterus and fallopian tubes removed. My other health conditions meant a pregnancy might kill me. Why risk dying, knowing that the government had made it illegal to save me? People thinking doctors would take significant personal risks for them are naive. Most people wouldn't even inconvenience themselves to keep me safe when I was a child. I might struggle with social cues, but I understand the ugliness of human nature.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nNo one stood up for me, ever. I knew, based on experience, that the only person I can count on is myself. So I did what was necessary while I still could. I'm not safe from Trump's regime.

I could imagine this applies to many red voting people aswell, those that make money above the brackets that Trump gives benefits, want that money, they don't care about other people. Also, college alone does not make someone educated nor smart, so in a sense that is moot point now that i think about it.

Or making it seem like America embraced a Black man, when guns flew off the market immediately after Obama was elected. They was a rise in hate crimes immediately after; in my local town, Black people were getting threatening/hateful hand written letters and nooses sent to their homes etc etc; it was scary. Even the Obamas were getting death threats. So when I see ppl suggesting that somehow America was \u201cokay\u201d with a Black man as president, it feels dismissive.",

If you keep spouting people that they are misogynist, racists etc, average human is going to vote him out of spite. Just because you can talk these things in the echo chamber of reddit, abortion, immigration, sexual minorities. Fact is, average human does not give a shit about those things, as long as their own life is not up to their standards.",
         "I don't give a ripe flying fuck if the truth is \"the wrong way to think.\" If anything, coddling misogynists and racists, trying to soothe their egos and \"economic anxiety\" is to blame. A man would have likely beaten Trump, so the things you are claiming would make a difference are wrong, including your claim about people's lives not being up to their standards, which with real wages outpacing inflation for a couple years now, lowest unemployment rate, etc., etc., is a either a delusion or a lie. It's not economic anxiety now or before--it's a reactionary response to women and poc making gains (never mind running for president), so a different message was never going to matter."

I mentioned before that I have an uncle who compared the attitude to those people who were on the Titanic and didn't get in the lifeboats because they didn't believe the ship was going to sink.  I tried to read up about it and found that it's called \"normalcy bias,\" a kind of thinking error that causes people to minimize warnings of actual danger.\n\nThink about all the people who didn't vote in 2000, or 2004, or 2016, and if you had said that Roe v. Wade could be overturned, they would say \"Roe v. Wade has been the law for 50 years, of course it's not going away.\"  It's not that they hated women and wanted it overturned, they just didn't believe it was going to happen.  Roe v. Wade had become normal, and so they assumed it would always continue.  I've been reading stuff online about Trump, with people saying, \"Oh, he's not going to do all that awful stuff, be a dictator, he was just joking.\"  They don't want a dictator, they're just not able to get past their normalcy bias and see that he does mean what he says.\n\nNow that I learned about that, I plan to keep it in my back pocket for the next time a \"men are more logical\" discussion gets started.  Men supporting Trump are proving that they are not objective or logical, they are thinking with emotions instead of reason, and when they dismiss warnings about how terrible he is they are proving that they lack the brainpower to get past their own normalcy bias.",

Women were and still are very sacred beings. The bridge for new life from the spirit realm into our physical realm. Emotions are a blessing when we learn how to be true to ourselves and not let them over take us, which women are blessed to learn and master a lot sooner than men. Maternal instinct is a force mother nature herself would steer clear of. It is the women who led in important decisions involving everyone's well being. It is the Women who decided almost everything and were sought out with high, sacred regard.\n\nI am in Canada and have chosen to be ignorant to the United States for the most part along with the politics here as well. I just started in university and am only now starting to learn politics at age 34. My heart has always been heavy with the news I hear from things that happen in the states. We really aren't much better up here when it comes to many things, especially the misogyny and racism. Seems to be colonial trademarks along with genocide. My room mates daughter is 12 and identifies and non binary. The amount of tears I've heard and seen come from that strong, beautiful, innocent heart in regards to bullying from school. It is normal and kids being kids but to have to switch schools because the staff also started to partake in it or would turn a blind eye thus condoning such behavior? The amount of disgusting sht the kids learn at home then bring into school projecting their parents meaningless, pitiful, shallow understandings onto others? Is growing exponentially since I was in grade school for some reason up here too.\n\nI don't think we will ever see something with balance in it when it comes to us all as a race, humanity in a global society. Not as long as us in Western society and this world in general thrives off the over consumption of our planet that mothers us all. Colonizers, greed ran pitiful excuses of human beings and colonizing sympathizers can't respect her, why would they respect any other female?\n\nI'm sorry life has been so difficult for you as a woman OP, truly I am. It most likely won't get any easier either. But we aren't here for an easy life. We are here to make our children's and our grandchildrens lives easier and so on and so forth. \n\nLife in Canada has not been easy as an Indigenous young man who was born to a single mother who was once both a residential school and 60s scoop survivor. In fact, it is only getting harder now that I'm trying to get myself university level educated. The things being taught about our history here in university is a whitewashed version of events. Which I got first hand stories of... add in I have children I'm alienated from and recently overcame addictions and homelessness too. Sh*t doesn't get easier, our shoulders just get stronger.

         ">So why did the greater religiousness of evangelicals not keep them from embracing Donald Trump? Because for a great many of them, despite all the fuss and bother and appearances, their religion is simply not important. Their religious commitment, like the person they think they are, does not exist in significant ways. When Donald Trump came along, resplendent in moral shortcomings but promising the moon, evangelicals had little difficulty setting aside their supposed beliefs and supporting him. In fact, this was their S.O.P. They had been setting those beliefs aside 167 hours a week for most of their lives. Con men know that the easiest people to fool are the people who persistently fool themselves.

         "There may be more, but I know of 4, based on [this source](https://khalielawright.com/patron-saints-of-abortion/)\n\n[Brigid of Kildare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigid_of_Kildare)\n\n>\"A certain woman who had taken the vow of chastity fell, through the youthful desire of pleasure, and her womb swelled with child. Brigid, exercising the most potent strength of her ineffable faith, blessed her, causing the child to disappear, without coming to birth, and without pain. She faithfully returned the woman to health and to penance\"\n\n[Ciar\u00e1n of Saigir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciar%C3%A1n_of_Saigir#cite_note-15)\n\n>He is reputed in the Lives as having miraculously performed abortion in a raped nun called Bruinnech.\n\nThe wikipedia page also has a response from a more modern Catholic on this, which amusingly is basically \"yo we just make all this Saint stuff up it doesn't mean anything\".\n\n[\u00c1ed mac Bricc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%81ed_mac_Bricc)\n\n>On one occasion, when he perceived that the girl serving him was pregnant he fled from the building both to avoid the pollution and to shame her. She confessed her sins and did penance. \u00c1ed was not one to leave someone under his care in a difficult situation; he blessed her womb and the baby disappeared as if it had never been there.\n\nSo this Saint will emotionally abuse you a bit first, but then he will provide miracle healthcare.\n\n[Cainnech of Aghoboe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cainnech_of_Aghaboe) His wikipedia page doesn't mention his holy abortion, but the first source has this story.\n\n>A certain nun living in Cainnech of Aghaboe\u2019s neighborhood secretly committed fornication. In time, her womb began to grow with the child conceived. She asked Saint Cainnech to bless her belly, pretending that it was swollen by some ailment or pain. When he blessed her, the infant in her womb vanished, not appearing.\n\nNote that every one of these Saints is Irish, and if you google it's these four Saints that you will find, in many different places. I'm not sure if that's because these really are the only four Saints that performed documented abortions, or because these were popularized by some expert of Irish history or something, but there are others out there that aren't as well known. It's also possible that they just have more of a widespread and popular mythology about them, that the Catholic church can't scrub out as much. Like the previous poster said, the Bible literally has instructions on how to perform an abortion, so I really doubt that only these four Saints in one time period and part of the world were celebrated for this, compared to some quirk of history and religion making it so that their legend was the one that wasn't overwritten.",

I ended up with a birth certificate that says none on the religious section. I don't know what his motivation was for that. But in any case ever since I was a kid I always had an interest in religion like I had an interest for lore of anything. I find the religion intriguing in its own right even if I don't believe in any of it. I have always believed in God though. Although I always have seen God in a way that no one else that I have met has. I see God as a floating ball of infinite energy. And that that energy is what flows though all of us. When I was a kid I surmised that this is what gave us all consciousness. I also surmised that God gives little to no shits about how you worship them.

I've been able to have some good conversations about getting egnaged and managing anxiety. And I get it, I think Harris likely will win but I'm a nervous goddamn wreck right now.

I don\u2019t know, because I can\u2019t tell what the fuck is even going on anymore.\n\nLatino people vote for an openly racist person who has explicitly said he wants them deported. Women vote for a rapist who has already successfully stripped reproductive rights from them. Military members vote for a draft-dodging prick who calls veterans suckers and losers. \n\nI don\u2019t even know.",
         "Can you imagine being a suffragette and seeing women sit this out? I think of it as an insult to their legacy. We can move on from the shame of past apathy and we can move forward by participating and making our voices heard.",
         "And I\u2019d like to thank the GOP for making their intentions blatantly clear enough for people to feel threatened. Thank you, Trump, for making me realize how important it is to uphold our civil rights through organization and involvement. I guess the disgusting sack of shit is good for *something*.",

I'm concerned that economically aspirational Latin men (predominantly) and women to a lesser extent may be taken in by some of his rhetoric and may brush off the racism. I wouldn't be surprised if some younger black men were taken in for the same reason. I just feel so frustrated that people are being taken in by his non-existent economic plans at the cost of being seen as basically subhuman. That's insanely depressing, though I suppose not necessarily a new thing. His rhetoric has been so fucking nasty, though.\n\nI don't know if white women are finally coming to their senses, but preliminary reporting I've seen on this didn't reflect that to the extent that some sources reflected prior to now.

People inexplicably lap it up\n\nYeah, I totally agree. It's such a crazy time in terms of voting implications. The other thing's just the rage one feels when a vote for Trump \"on economic grounds\" implicates voters in his mass deportation plan - something that is not only obviously inhumane and convoluted, but which is obviously far from free-of-cost to arrange and would cut, what, 10 million extremely essential workers from the US job market?

They went +20% for Biden and now +10% for Trump. How much of that was greed or misogyny I can't say, but a large number that didn't support him before voted for him this time while one of his biggest talking points was mass deportation of immigrants. Of course, they are not all immigrants, but enough of them are, have immigrant parents, or relatives, or friends, that it is shocking.\n\nA lot of people are simply looking at their grocery bill, the cost of filling their tank, and housing costs and think  that must be the Biden administration. Inflation has gone down. Prices haven't returned to pre-2020, but that won't happen absent price regulation. I doubt the Republicans will do that, either. Trump talks about tariffs like that will make prices fall. It's clearly a lie, but enough people buy it.\n\nStill, the inescapable fact is that a bit of extra money in their pockets at the end of the day is worth more than other people's rights.

I cannot even stomach the idea of speaking to him right now, and I didn\u2019t want to hear lies from him. It makes some level of sense because he\u2019s always had a deep care and spoiling type of relationship with my kid, where he does almost nothing for his own grandchildren.\n\nOne of my closest friends was even flippant, and was like, The good news is you\u2019ll be loaded! I have had similar reactions from everyone else. The REALITY is that I feel deeply betrayed and sad. It is quickly spiraling into this sense of grief, anger, and some sort of lost feeling.\n\nI don\u2019t have the luxury of just pretending it didn\u2019t happen because now I have the burden of knowing it did. I literally don\u2019t even know how in the hell to deal with it. Right now I\u2019m avoiding any conversation with humans I know, but I would welcome any advice on how I should deal with this.",

         "It\u2019s probably worth noting that my son is highly inquisitive, and in school they were doing family trees, and adoption came up. He knows my husband is his stepdad, but hasn\u2019t yet been curious about the rest. I wanted to know what ancestral background he has so I could share it when he wants it, and raise him strong in the truth and not lies like I was raised with. The rapist had a huge opinion that it was useless and it wouldn\u2019t matter to my son, and that I shouldn\u2019t test him. Which in hindsight means he knew or at least suspected my son is his, which means he knows he raped me. For years he has just lied to me and manipulated me.",

They may say it's best to just pursue family court and paternity, or they may suggest you go to civil court first, or the police. \n\nCivil court has a lower standard of evidence, while criminal court requires \"no shadow of a doubt\". And yes, civil court means you can get a settlement or be awarded damages. Will the money help you feel better? No. But this person owes you far beyond anything they could ever possibly provide you. In this world the closest thing we have to that is money. \n\n\nI know there's not really any such thing as \"justice\".  You need something in black and white proving this person is a predator so you can protect your child from them.",

Once you have undeniable proof, report him to the police or punish him yourself, financially, for his betrayal\u2026make him pay one way or another. Another option is to threaten going to the authorities to get him to sign away his parental rights. The fact that he hasn\u2019t come forward despite how he feels for your child just means he\u2019s afraid that someone will find out. It\u2019s a terrible situation to be in.

It\u2019s all the years of comments about how much my son looks like him as a little boy, sideways comments that led to directly ask if anything had ever happened.

How that man spends his twilight years is up to you. Whether he gets to spend them in a cushy retirement home or a jail cell is up to you. Even if you decide not to press charges you have enough evidence to lean on him for him to step up and provide for your son. Not in gifts, not spoiling, but in real tangible and it sounds potentially life-changing ways. I am not saying to blackmail him (but I absolutely wouldn\u2019t judge if you did..) but that you now get to decide how this horrific story gets to conclude. You get to decide what punishment he should face. \n\nIn a moment, where he has completely robbed you of your agency, bodily autonomy, and power, he has somehow now also given you enough evidence to gain some of that power back.

But I felt safe, and frequently stayed at his house when I went to the city, and he even kept a bedroom for me. I stayed because I trusted him 100%.

I\u2019m O+, he\u2019s AB-, my son is B-, and I have no idea about my ex, but figured it was just weird, not that he raped me.

Either he shouldn\u2019t have sought out a 2nd term from the beginning, this way it goes the primaries system to decide the next Democratic candidate, or they should\u2019ve just stuck with Biden. Hard to say what the outcome would\u2019ve been though because that\u2019s a what if at this point. Who knows, maybe Biden should\u2019ve stepped down as President too, this way it would\u2019ve gave Kamala a chance as President for voters to better gauge.\n\nSome have said the country doesn\u2019t want a female president. I would disagree with that by using the 2016 popular vote as reference, Hillary Clinton beat him on that.\n\nSecondly, the party did imho pick the worst possible replacement. Even in 2020, through the primaries, some have done much better than her. Honestly, she wasn\u2019t even on my list of people to replace Biden.\n\nThird, she didn\u2019t differentiate herself enough.\n\nI\u2019ll probably edit this to add more. I\u2019m half awake and a bit upset right now.",

And although their work was instrumental in making that passage possible, they did not work to prioritize making voting rights accessible to all women.

         "I will repost this (you can quote me & repost it too, if you like) cause women in the US really need to grasp they can't just cherry pick which violence of the US settler state they embrace - eventually it is gonna come for them one way or another. \n\nRegardless of who wins, I actually truly hope that if none of the other violence the US settler state causes makes a lot of you reflect on your \"electoral politics\" - this shit right here will make you angry enough to not want to entertain something like it again & also understand that no matter what political theater your society pulls, you cant just \"outvote\" the racist and fascist nature of your society. \n\nhttps://www.indigenousaction.org/voting-is-not-harm-reduction-an-indigenous-perspective/\n\nhttps://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/coordination-of-anarchist-groups-against-democracy (to understand why neoliberals in the West acting like electoral politics for the status quo, are not the \"freedom\" and fair process most of you all think it is. That includes this election too. For example - something like Trump should have never even been a candidate at all, regardless of who is willing to vote for him). \n\nhttps://redsails.org/the-pitfalls-of-liberalism/ (to understand why neoliberals are historically and systemically complicit in that violence).\n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1884/origin-family/\n(Works of Frederick Engels 1884, The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State, to understand how patriarchy, birth, capitalism and abortions are connected). \n\nBasically, the institution of patriarchal family required, as its foundation, the dominance of the man over the woman and the confinement of all property relations within the family / to secure property inheritance within male lineage. As a result, women were confined to roles of childbearing and household labor, making them \"means of production and reproduction\" to sustain family wealth. This structure arose from the value placed on private property and inheritance, creating social control over women\u2019s labor and reproduction. Capitalism later built on this setup, relying on women\u2019s unpaid domestic labor to maintain a steady workforce, reinforcing male dominance and the exploitation of women to sustain the economic system.\n\nIn addition:\n\n1) Read leftist theory. Political education IS important to truly grasp what is happening in your society & why and why it obviously affects you and your rights and so on. \n\n2) Join leftist orgs, in particular marxist feminist orgs in your community, if you have none, start forming them! Endless of women who could never rely on the US settler state and its laws  to protect them or aid them, had to rely through history on mutual aid, being part of a community that shows up for eachother and so on. (That includes underground movements). \n(Note: I wanted to make a radical marxist feminist platform on discord, meaning anti western imperial, capitalist and choice feminist nonsense, that does not center straight cis men - if anyone is interested, hit me up via PM). \n\n3) Organized protests. No, not holding signs and bs - organized worker protests with demands. You will have to connect across your country, decide on the demands you have and walk out. Walk out of your jobs, your roles as mothers, grandmothers, workers. You all have been the shit pacified while not acknowledging that your BIGGEST weapon is the fact that you make half of your society and if you refuse to do labor for a certain period of time - your society is gonna shake. They rely on your free labor, your physical labor, all of it. \n\n4) Divest from men, build and nurture solidarity and community with other women. Think \"xyz dude is cute\", does he give a fuck about your rights? Does he give a fuck about systemic oppression, history and so on? No? Move on. Stop putting your energy into relationships with men who do not even care for your basic human rights. \n\n5) Divest from sex in any form that can get you pregnant. There are endless of other ways to get off. Maybe that will motivate some of the men in your life to actually give a fck? Probably not hmm. Eitherway, less chances to get pregnant. \n\n6) If that is not a sacrifice you want to bring for more safety and you still want to take more risks, copper IUD, hormonal IUD, hormonal implant, tied tubes & expecting the men in your life to step tf up! Keep in mind that even after vasectomies it might not be safe for months & there needs to be a frequent visits to make sure sperm count is in order (plus still use condoms in addition to make sure you are safe). Never center short term convenience and pleasure over your physical safety in a society that will treat you as an incubator and is more than willing to see you dead.\n\n7) Pregnancy strike. I am not sure how any woman is still willing to pop babies... but those ideologies and rules are not only for women who don't want kids. If you want kids you are not automatically \"safe\". It could still get you killed. Consider that. \n\n8) Do not automatically trust your family, partner or doctors or anyone, if you deal with unwanted pregnancy. \n\n9) Don't leave any traces or records online those track your period & could potentially be used to incriminate you.\n\n10) Consider moving to another country if it is something you can afford. \n\n11) Have an emergency fund if that is something you can afford.\n\n12) Train & arm yourself.",

Not sleeping with someone you love and who loves and respects and sees you as a full human being just because he's a man is another, honestly batshit one. Honestly, expecting straight women to not love men *at all* as a political choice is just as crazy as conservatives expecting gay people to ignore their true orientation and roleplay being straight. And having kids is not just something women do \"for men.\" A lot of us want children for ourselves. Treating babies as a resource womankind should withhold from men ignores the fact that we'd also be withholding them from ourselves.\n\nSorry, just my two cents.

Having a sexual relationship is inherent risk for a woman, *especially* if the woman cannot have control over her own reproductive system. The *least* a man can do is compensate for that.

I care about our side and what the idea of a sex ban implies for women.\n\nI'm saying that expecting women to \"withhold sex\" assumes that sex \u2014 and romantic love, more importantly \u2014 is something most of can and should be expected to cut out of our lives. To me, this idea echoes the sexist thought you see in conservative religious and incel spaces that women have this cool detachment from sex \u2014 that we aren't sexual creatures  like men are, that we can just decide to be \"\"\"pure\"\"\" and celibate without losing something important about ourselves and our humanity. That sex isn't a part of our humanity. Sex isn't just about fun. It is about love. And love is part of our humanity. \n\nPersonally, I can't give that up.  I can't give up love, and I won't. I love my partner, he loves me. He's as torn up \u2014\u00a0if not more \u2014\u00a0about what's happening than I am. He isn't the problem. A lot of individual men aren't the problem. I have a lot of rage at men as a class, but I don't hate the individual men I know who are good allies now just because they're men.\n\nDo I think women should be in partnerships with men who don't respect their humanity and who vote and act against their rights? Absolutely not. Do I think women should consider very carefully who they get into relationships with and effecitvely trust with their lives? Yes. I just find the idea of a blanket ban on heterosexuality pretty ridiculous.  \n\nI definitely have empathy. I wouldn't have kids in the US right now. But I understand that some women will still choose to risk their lives having kids *because the risk is personally worth it to them \u2014* and yes, some women already willingly do this already, i.e. people choosing to go forward with risky multiples pregnancies and other high-risk pregnancies. I don't see those women as gender traitors. I see them as sisters who made a choice I wouldn't. And I empathize with women who feel they cannot be in any relationship with any man right now. I just would hope that those women would extend the same empathy to their sisters who cannot or will not make the same choice. \n\nI hope that's a bit clearer.",

A man living in the same house and not fucking other women on the side is not some worthwhile thing in itself. That's why I think women should keep their standards high. Men are wired to seek out women, they need to access them. Supply and demand. Women are the ones who set the bar. If the bar is low, we should raise it.",

Yes, they have been picking their partners that way whenever that choice hasn't been stripped from them with arranged marriages. Even if you look at other species, the females are choosing males that can provide them resouces like food, or prove their strength by defeating their male rivals stc. But even with all that aside, why do you think that prostitution is called the \"oldest profession\"? The earliest mention of prostitution is over *four thousand* years old.

Is that what we've been doing?\n\nI absolutely disagree with you on that considering young women these days have no issues whatsoever chasing men around, throwing themselves at them and hanging on their necks in clubs.   The irony being that \\*I\\* got called a pick me today.  Women today have no standards actually, the majority don't that's for sure.  They have no issues picking up dusty, violent or immoral men and then giving them free access to their bodies.  The reasons for that are many, but the truth is that actually NO we haven't been doing that at all.\n\nIt appears that there are a subset of women out there who are prepared to take no accountability whatsoever for their own behaviour yet moan about the patriarchy and \"all men\" whilst having little to no standards themselves.  Their complete lack of accountability only fuels the divide.  \n\nAs for women realising sex can be exchanged for money that's very true, apparently it can also be exchanged for validation as well!!",

I've never been one of those easy-to-get women you described, though I can see where they're coming from, and I do blame our patriarchal soceity and the social conditioning that girls recieve from the moment they start to crawl. Women have been introctrinated into thinking that living up to expectations that males set them is the ultimate achievement and they are worthless if they fail to do that. Not getting married and having children as a woman is depicted as this utterly miserable and lonely life, even though we now know that it's a scam, because it's actually the men that need and benefit from relationships/marriage.

I still get horrifying flash backs of how he talked to waitresses or things he said about women.  I started hearing it around 10 or so, but it took me till 17 when he started attacking me too to see, he was never sticking up for me, but rather just needed control.  I haven\u2019t spoken to him in over 4 years after he had the audacity to yell at me to pieces and say \u201cfuck you\u201d for reiterating his idea in different words.\n\nThe point of this being- maybe the women are somehow brain washed or in a position of disillusionment.  I pray to whatever is left in the universe they find their voice and see the pattern.  I lost so much of myself because I thought men like him were on the \u201cgood side\u201d.

It wasn't rocket science, and had a good success rate, and tests a lot of me/the date (I'm not a creep/I can be in public/date is interested enough to bring dessert, options to flirt)...the bar is so low.

Did you mention enjoying cooking or being good at it?  He might think you want to show off your cooking.

But, at least to me, a cooking date means you both cook. I'm perfectly fine with being her bitch... ok sous chef and just doing the prep or stuff she doesn't wanna do.

         "Oh for sure. But it\u2019s quite easy to make a bad one and make it look like you tried to make a good meal.",
         "Even worse then, why would he think you would want to cook for him if you never mentioned it? Is it because you're a woman and therefore know how to cook and desperately want to cook for HIM?\n\nI would not go on that second date.",

         "Exactly!! THAT is how it is done. And when you've gotten to know each other, a joint cooking date as an activity together is a fabulous idea. (I'm a fan of activity dates in general.) But those early ones are definitely for the one who plans to cook to make the invite.",
         "I cannot recommend this highly enough!! \n\nAnd remember that later in life, married men are the happiest and live the longer compared to single men and single women are the happiest and live longer compared to married women.

If project 2025 is to be believed, they'll also enact a national abortion ban, as well as mass deportations of immigrants and imprisonment of trans people (along with others they believe to be sexual deviants), plus banning porn. Trump has a tariff plan as well that will result in most americans paying more for daily goods, while giving drastic tax breaks to the ultra wealthy. They'll stop sending aid to ukraine, and most likely reverse sanctions on russia, and they have a soft stance on taiwan, so it wouldnt be a surprise if china decided now is a good chance to invade there.
