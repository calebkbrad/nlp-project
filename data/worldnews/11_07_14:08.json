         "There are decades where nothing happens;\u00a0and there are weeks where decades happen",
         "People keep pushing for negotiations. Like... do you understand what is happening here?  What negotiations could there possibly be?  \n\nUkraine: Stop invading our country. \n\nRussia: No. \n\nUkraine: OK, negotiation failed.  We will continue to defend ourselves.",
         ">Three decades ago, the newly independent country of Ukraine was briefly the third-largest nuclear power in the world.\n\n\n\n>Thousands of nuclear arms had been left on Ukrainian soil by Moscow after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. But in the years that followed, Ukraine made the decision to completely denuclearize.\n\n>In exchange, the U.S., the U.K. and **Russia would guarantee Ukraine's security in a 1994 agreement known as the Budapest Memorandum.**\n\nhttps://www.npr.org/2022/02/21/1082124528/ukraine-russia-putin-invasion\n\nThere is no negotiating with Russia. They *might* stop for a bit before doing it again.",
         "The only concessions Putin should be getting is a tub of lube for when he is locked up in The Hague for war crimes.",
         "Yep, that's my assessment, too. The absolute minimum requirement for any concessions would be extremely robust security guarantees \u2013 guarantees that involve boots on the ground if Ukraine is attacked again. Anything else would make it practically certain that Ukraine will be attacked again regardless of prior concessions.",
         "Jesus christ...The next 4 years are going to be awful.",
         "Ukraine, fire up the Centrifuges.  It's over, Nuclear Non-Proliferation is dead",
         "Putins western misinformation campaign was the most successful thing russia has done in decades. Russia helped build trump and now trump is gonna repay them by giving them ukraine",
         "Here's how it'll go--\n\n**Trump**: Zel you have to give occupied territory to Putin\n\n\n**Zel**: No\n\n\n**Putin**: Ukraine can't join NATO and we keep all territory\n\n\n**Trump**: Zel you have to listen to Putins demands or else I'll pull all aid\n\n\n**Zel**: OK well fuck us I guess\n\n\n**Putin**: *chortles*\n\n\n**Trump**: I'm the best dealmaker\n\n\nPutin then waits until next Democrat is in office and then invades Ukraine again.",
         "Appeasement does not work.  It only encourages the behavior that got us here in the first place.\n\nMake concessions to Russia, expect them to come back as soon as they've regrouped.",
         "Ukraine already made concessions when they left years ago. They agreed to give up their nukes for a peace promise. Look how well that was upheld",
         "Appeasement doesn\u2019t work.",
         "What every country with potential neighboring conflicts have learned is that they essentially need nukes because you can\u2019t rely on the democratic west. It\u2019s so sad to see but the future will be many new nuclear powers",
         "Time for Europe to wake up and help its neighbor. We can\u2019t allow Trump to decide what is allowed in our backyard.",
         "Negotiating with terrorists never works.\n\n\nPutin's Russia is nothing less than a terrorist state.",
         "Joe should toss them a few nukes as an official act. That'll even things up. They should never have given them away in exchange for an empty promise.",
         "Yep. He didn't honor the last peace treaty where they gave up their nucs in return sovereignty. He won't the next one. He isn't trust worthy.",
         "Agree with you 100% Zelenskyy",
         "Europe, for the love of humanity, step up and arm Ukraine.\n\n\\-signed an ashamed American.",
         "Eventually he may have to make concessions but not immediately and not complete capitulation and walking away from NATO.",
         "only way they are going to win now if they remove Putin completely, even if it sparks outrage from nato.",
         "Russia will go further though. Ukraine gave up its nukes under a promise that Russia would go no further. And Russia is not in a position of power. They\u2019ve decimated their military to the point they\u2019re relying on hand outs from Iran and NK. There will be no negotiations they already failed the day Russia invaded. Russian words are not even worth the scent of the cheap vodka that comes with them.",
         "Not sure what the end game will ever wind up being here.  Ukraine, rightfully, wants Russia out.  Russia wants Ukraine.  That is pretty black and white and neither side is going to give any ground on that.\n\nThe war is essentially at a stalemate.  Ukraine wants the west to keep supporting them indefinitely.   Russia appears fine with this being a forever war. Like do you just accept a militarized border with the occasional explosions deeper inside Ukraine or Russia forever?\n\nNot sure how this ends without escalating or concessions.",
         "Well, godspeed buddy, Clockwork orange, coming up.",
         "The right doesn't care. Putin was their second choice after trumpo",
         "Yes it is\n\n\nPutin and people like him respect strength and power; if you show weakness he will move in for the kill\n\n\nPutin himself admitted the Kursk territory grab was to gain concessions in negotiations. So he recognizes this reality",
         "Then don\u2019t offer concessions and have Europe back you. \n\nIf all of Europe can\u2019t support Ukraine against Russia and NK then that\u2019s their own embarrassment to deal with.",
         "Trump: I tried one thing and I am all out of ideas",
         "Putin has shown any Russian promises aren't worth trusting. Any \"peace\" that allows Russia to rest, get out of sanctions, then attack again in 5 years isn't peace at all.",
         "That's all Trumps gonna offer you. RIP I guess.",
         "From other articles, I am glad to see that Zelenskyy has already started in on the \"stroke Trump's ego\" approach. With other Presidents you might talk about world order, or war crimes, or justice... with Trump you tell he is great. That his election win was stunning, a mandate from God. You also tell these things to the world. Every call with Trump is an excellent call. You start filling out the paper work for his Nobel peace prize nomination. Makes statues of him across Ukraine, suggest he build a Hotel in their capitol.\n\nIt does sound silly... but I'm not even really exaggerating. This is how you work with Trump when he has something you need. All of his handlers know that. Musk, Vance, Graham, Cruz, RFK; just a small list of people who were publicly anti-Trump, then they bent the knee, and Trump rewarded them.\n\nGet Trump to stop calling Ukraine corrupt and start calling them important allies. He's not going to turn his back on his buddy Putin, but he might be a little less quick to pull all aid and force concessions from Ukraine.",
         "If you start letting bank robbers keep their loot, then you're going to get a shit load more bank robberies.\n\n\nThat's why appeasement doesn't work.",
         "There's some live feed on YT with Putin being interviewed at a \"Valadai Discussion Club\" - he's being asked about AI now. Like does he really think he can now start curating his media image, something akin to sportswashing, and he'll just sign a peace treaty? There are hundreds thousands of killed people in this war...he must be crazy. This isn't something you can just move on from. And here he is live, talking to the world about climate change, AI and so on when he is the one who threw shit into chaos...\n\nDude, you're either going to Hague, or you aren't going anywhere...he's completely insane if he thinks this is something he can just move on from as if nothing happened.",
         "Then let's make sure that doesn't happen. Let's talk at r/ActionForUkraine and spread the word.",
         "Trump will do whatever is absolutely necessary to get his Nobel Peace Prize, and then allow Putin to waltz right into Ukraine and take the whole fucking thing.",
         "If Ukraine is able to defend itself and push back Russia, then Ukraine has the call on what to give and what not to give.\n\nBut if Ukraine is at the mercy of NATO, and Trump is set on diverting resources from aiding Ukraine, then no amount of pleading will help.",
         "Blow the dome over Chernobyl an walk off.   Putin will purge Ukraine",
         "The guy lost half of his countrymen and 3rd of its territory plus billions of western money but still wants to keep the war going.",
         "I wonder if Zelensky knew on election night how fucked he was?",
         "I fear the worst for Ukraine, god bless",
         "Zelenskyy's life is pretty much over if Ukraine loses the war and agree to a ceasefire. Putin will certainly find ways to assassinate him after the war, especially if he steps down as president. Putin doesn't take kindly to people who defies him.",
         "Unfortunately Europeans do not care for what Zelensky has to say and the new POTUS despises him. The end game for Ukraine is near.\n\nAt the end of all this, a thug state would have won and hundreds of thousands would have died in vain.",
         "Hey theres no free lunches\u2026 only way i could see Ukraine gaining everything back is through killing putin and throwing russia in chaos (who knows the ramifications of that)\u2026 or dramatic intervention from the EU or US\u2026 both of which aren\u2019t likely\u2026 but he has to start the negotiations as far to his side as possible so i see why he says that\u2026 but in reality, the best case scenario is arming Ukraine to the teeth and forcing a freeze of the line and forcing putin to the table\u2026 it saves the most lives, and they may get something out of it in negotiations for less sanctions\u2026 we must remember biden didnt give Ukraine what it needed, when it needed it\u2026 also this would involve peace keepers (trip wire forces) on the border they decide on\u2026",
         "Everyone in Europe can tell.",
         "And yet he said he had an excellent call with Trump.\n\nThere's no doubt in my mind that Trump's plan to \"end the war\" includes concessions.  \n\nI want to know what was said on that call.  My guess is Zelenskyy is touting an \"excellent\" call to keep morale up.",
         "lol he was also quoted saying how well his first call with trump went. The rhetoric is crazy.",
         "There is not much Zelensky can do. Trump will deal with Putin whether Zelensky participates as dictated by Trump or without him, leaving it all for Putin and EU to decide. Either of those two options is good news for Putin and bad for EU. \n\nThe American companies are already discussing resumption of trades with Russia even before official sanctions are lifted.",
         "Sorry Ukraine. America has checked the fuck out.",
         "The goal here is to get ride of Zelenskyy and then attempt a take over via voter suppression.  Zelenskyy can\u2019t be voted out while  war remains. Stopping without Ukraine winning the war may put someone more sympathetic to Russia\u2019s cause.",
         "I'm an Ukrainian supporter but can I ask how the fuck is Zelenskyy planning to retake back lost territory? He is just bleeding soldiers and losing land every day.",
         "Ukraine can\u2019t win it\u2019s obvious to anyone who has been paying attention. The amount of territory Russia has gained in the past weeks shows their forces are depleted. The cope is real the US accomplished its goal by significantly weakening Russia. We\u2019re done boys time to make America great again.",
         "Whoa calm down mr. Peacemaker. What happened to 'find peace in Putin's eyes' and 'just stop shooting'?",
         "Trump's unteachable. He knows what he knows, and, of course he's sure that everything he believes is some version of brilliant \ud83d\ude44, so how he thinks he's going to solve this is....... smh.\n\nWe're in for four more years of endless, incoherent, middle of the night tweets, bragging, boasting, insulting, demeaning, and belittling people, and severe, perhaps irreversible damage to our system of government. \n\nAt least the Fact Checker at the Washington Post will have full employment.",
         "I mean sounds good but what if the reality is that the Ukrainians can't push Russia off their territory, the battle lines are pretty static. At the end of the day, the people with guns on the land are those who control it. We can't fund this conflict perpetually, if Ukraine was paying for it themselves then great, all power to them but at a certain point the reality of the situation needs to kick in\n\nNegotiating while Ukraine still holds some of Kursk is strategic, if the Russians drive them out and reclaim it Ukraine loses practically all its leverage in negotiations. Waiting to negotiate could be a major blunder",
         "*\"Some of you have been hugging him for 20 years, and things are only getting worse.\"*\n\nRespect to Zelenskyy for amount of work he has done, and yet some still don't listen.",
         "Might be suicidal not to.",
         "make up your mind zelensky. you just had an \"excellent\" phone call with president elect trump right?",
         "Stop murdering your people and fucking give him the Donbas region who gives a fuck they\u2019re already speaking and culturally Russian. \n\nI\u2019m done sending my money there. \n\nWhere the fuck is Peace!",
         "It\u2019s time to end the war",
         "Well\u2026 suicide for him, definitely.\n\nFor the ukrainian people ? they are currently dying on the frontlines so\u2026.",
         "I miss the decades where nothing happens. Feels like I\u2019ve had way too many weeks in my life that packed in a decade or two\u2026",
         "We are in for decades where centuries happen, it already started a few years ago.",
         "Reminds me of that ancient curse: \"may you live in interesting times and attract the attention of important people\"",
         "That's deep and true",
         "Maybe the world really did end in 2012 and we're just witnessing its decay.",
         "I'm feeling like every new day is a decade",
         "so deep meaning ....",
         "We are in a year where all the happenings will never be forgotten, even centuries.",
         "Trump has been in politics for nearly a decade now, so what does that mean?\n\nThere's decades where centuries happen?",
         "The reality is that until Putin invades countries West of the old Soviet Block no one is truly getting involved. Even crazier is that there is now evidence that Russia is trying to back door terrorist strategies like sending weapons on flights to \u2018enemy\u2019 (read that as western) nations\u2026",
         "Only uneducated vatniks and Russian bots use the negotiation-argument.",
         "And that's what Trump and Vance are for - to strongarm Ukraine into allowing Russia to steal the land and its children.",
         "if russia is allowed to keep the land that was stolen, then the only thing ukraine should ask for are nukes and be allowed to use them to ensure that russia doesn't just invade again.",
         "What? There\u2019s obvious conditions Russia would want if a negotiation was happening idk why you\u2019re acting like that doesn\u2019t exist. \n\nThe reality is if everyone agrees Russia situation is so horrible especially equipment wise then Russia actually is incentivized to negotiate a peace deal before that situation becomes untenable. \n\nSome of the conditions Russia would demand is probably the entirety of the annexed regions become recognized by Ukraine. And assurance that Ukraine never joins NATO. \n\nObviously these are bullshit and fucking Russia shouldn\u2019t get any of those concessions. But to me it is obvious Trump will use military aid to Ukraine both ways to get both countries to the negotiating table. If Ukraine refuses, Trump will no longer aid Ukraine and if Russia refuses then Trump may actually do more or continue aid to Ukraine. \n\nTrump doesn\u2019t give a fuck how that war ends, he only cares insofar as that the war ends. Because his actual sperg cult followers will then throw their hands into the air with trumps cum dripping off their chins at how incredible and powerful and respected Trump is that he achieved peace.",
         "The alternative is sending more and more people to die on the frontlines in a war that currently has no end in sight. Of course, that\u2019s good news for the weapons contractors involved.\n\nSeriously though, other than either diplomacy or a counter-invasion into Russia, I\u2019m not sure what options Ukraine has at stopping it.",
         "Putin - \u201cGive us your country or else we will keep murdering your people\u201d\n\nUkraine - \u201cNo\u201d\n\nTrump - \u201cUkraine won\u2019t negotiate, nothing I can do.\u201d",
         "It\u2019s actually usually\u2026. \n\nRussia: Okay, we can broker peace if you get out of Kursk and drop all claims on territories we seized and held sham elections in. Additionally you cannot enter the EU while at the same time we pinky swear, on my momma promise to never invade again!\n\nUkraine: No?\n\nRussia: God you filthy war mongering barbarians don\u2019t want peace, CaN\u2019T tHe WoRlD sEe We ArE tHe GoOd GuYs?!",
         "Unfortunately, no everyone sees it that way. They may say, give the dictator some land to stop all these deaths. Is it ideal? No but Ukraine IS LOSING. Whether we want to argue due to lack of support or not is totally different subject",
         "In the US, some people that I know voted trump are so afraid of any war that they think if we got involved more than we are already, they'll get instantly drafted. They're also the people that just think war is bad and we shouldn't have anything to do with any military activity. It blows my mind how little those people understand world politics and forget that we tried to be neutral in the World Wars and it still came to us anyway.",
         "There's a reason we don't negotiate with terrorists. Although, I think many people have forgotten about that now that the terrorists are going to be in the WH.",
         "It worked in Ukraine for eight years after Obama talked them into letting Putin have Donbas and Crimea. Putin will probably be dead in eight years so it isn't a terrible solution. Maybe we can get Obama to negotiate again.",
         "\"we\" will defend \"ourselves\"\n\nWhat do you mean exactly?",
         "They can\u2019t continue to defend themselves without American financial packages, weapons, intel and military cooperation.\n\nThey will not be receiving this once Trump gets into office.\n\nTime to swallow pride and compromise. It\u2019s not fair, life\u2019s not fair. It\u2019s happened to many countries and will continue to.\n\nIt\u2019s the reality of the situation. Unless the EU cripples themselves by stepping in where USA dropped off\u2026",
         "Well for one, Ukraine is not in the position to be making demands. Russia is in the position of strength here, occupying about 1/4 of the country and Ukraine has failed pushing them back at all and only getting weaker. \n\nNegotiations will be something like this, Russia will keep all annexed territories, a DMZ along the whole new border, and Ukraines military basically being a downgraded to a national police force, plus a guarantee of neutrality. In exchange, Ukraine will stop having its infrastructure bombed daily, people\u2019s lives will be saved, and Russia will go no further. If Ukraine doesn\u2019t agree to those then too bad, Russia will be moving forward and taking more as they have been.",
         "Or for more than a bit. Remember, Putin waited 10 whole years to only make his second move on Ukraine.",
         "Honestly, no. Not even that.",
         "He prefers reindeer antler blood baths",
         "Stick him in Diddy\u2019s cell",
         "How could they even trust such a guarantee though. The Russians where supposed to protect them when they gave up their nukes but they are now the ones attacking them. And the US changes their mind and forgets everything each 4 years.",
         "I said this in another thread today. This one goes out to the American isolationists.\n\nAll the convenient stuff about America being the dominant power will evaporate if our allies don\u2019t believe we will help them defend against Russia. Russia is implacable, desperate for land and ports, and has a way fucked up population pyramid. Russia needs vassal states to parasite off of in order to survive therefore Putin has motive to keep annexing more territory if left unchecked.\n\nIf America returns to an isolationist foreign policy the many small and medium countries that the US trades with and likes having the backing of in treaties and deals, will be conquered by Russia and become economic and territorial tools of Russia. Russia would attempt to conquer Europe further if allowed to do so in small steps. Along the way, ethnic cleansing and human rights violations are to be expected as they already do that in their existing borders.\n\nLess of the world would be free by the western definition, and would be a less interesting and pleasant place for Americans to be. With the dismantling of US military bases elsewhere, our ability to respond to serious threats like Iran\u2019s NKs nuclear programs will be diminished. Our military will no longer have the unique Global Reach capability it currently benefits from.\n\nForeign goods would become more expensive or unavailable. Visa free and restriction free foreign travel, which Americans enjoy more than any other country, will be reduced. Intellectual trade and education will be reduced. In other words the world will be deglobalized.\n\nThe lines of communication between countries that are neutral or friendly will be hampered and misunderstandings and brinkmanship would be more common. Imagine the Cuban Missle Crisis happening every year or so.\n\nAmerica was isolationist when we allowed Germany to expand their territory in steps before the war. At first there was no immediate harm to America. In fact if Japan had not bombed Hawaii at the suggestion of Hitler, America may not have entered the war until after Britain had been conquered. At its height the Nazi Empire controlled nearly all of Europe and some of Africa.\n\nDo you want another era where one single empire doesn\u2019t just influence, but despotically controls the whole right half of the map? The USSR tried in the 70s and 80s and it was America who stopped them. The conservative president Ronald Reagan, idolized as a folk hero by many republicans today, knew the threat of Russian aggression. His democrat predecessors Truman Kennedy and Johnson also took a hard line against Russia. Every experienced US politician of the last 60 years has respected the threat. Now is not the time to relent in our effort to secure the border between the eastern and western powers. This secures a freer world which benefits Americans every day in countless ways.",
         "I highly doubt Trump is smart enough to actually do that. In a deal he made with the taliban there was no enforcement structure.",
         "We already have that type of agreement, and its with Poland.",
         "100%. It's either territorial concessions with robust security guarantees with boots on the ground by Europe, or it's all territory has to be given back to Ukraine (which Russia would never agree on, as that would have made the whole war pointless, unless credibly threatened by an even worse outlook for them if they don't accept. Not happening for sure while they are advancing and the fight is looking favorable for them). And the former only works when Ukraine really thinks they can trust Europe to fulfill their promise when the time inevitably comes. But with pro-Russia parties on the rise across Europe, that trust would be unfounded. Russia needs to be threatened to be hurt very badly if they don't retreat, or attrited to the point they cannot go on. Everything else will just fuel further Russian conquest of other nations.",

It makes it almost impossible to build a bomb out of the Pu240, because the neutron flux causes too many fissions too early in the detonation, that the fissile core is destroyed before enough fission is induced to have an earth shattering kabooom.    Pu240 builds up in the fuel rods at a slower rate than Pu239, that experts have found that if you take the rods out of the reactor at 90 days, the Pu239 has built up without enough Pu240 to contaminate the yield.\n\nIf an organization was using a reactor to breed bomb material, they would have to have a stoppage at 90 days of operation to remove the fuel rods, and chemically separate the Plutonium. Most commercial reactors have refueling done every 18-24 months (1.5-2 years)",
         "While Pu239 is one of the most common fissile fuels for nuclear weapons, if the Uranium is in the reactor for too long, it starts to also accumulate Pu240.\n\nPu240 is not suitable for use in weapons, and builds up in the rods as they are exposed to the critical reactor.\n\nI believe the critical time is 90 days, where the Pu240 starts to build up to too much and poisons plutonium weapons.\n\nIt's easier to find out if a reactor is used on a 90 day cycle as opposed to a more common 18 month cycle for power reactors.",

No, in fact.\n\nAre people ODing on crazy pills or something? That would take years to achieve even if they were at peace and the US was fully on board with helping economically and technologically - which they wouldn\u2019t be even if Harris was headed to the White House. Trump is compromised and Biden/Harris are guzzling the *de-escalation* juice.

It is their sole instrument for clinging to global relevance. And I have seen no credible information to suggest that it\u2019s in some catastrophic state of inoperability.  \n\nI have, however, seen plenty of wartime propaganda deriding the Russians, which would make the gullible think that their entire military is staffed entirely by alcoholic, kleptocrat clones of the 3 Stooges. I would caution anyone from buying completely into such a conveniently painted picture. Americans can\u2019t even poll their own presidential races accurately, for fuck\u2019s sake.\n\nI\u2019m willing to believe that Russia\u2019s nuclear program is not as ready as it once was, but <25% readiness?

         "The question wouldn't only be if Biden would authorize it but if Zelensky would accept the offer. Instead the question should be will Ukraine win the war if allowed to drop the restrictions for the period of a couple months leading up to Trump being in office. If the answer is no then there are potentially very good reasons to not want to drop the restrictions. \n\nIf Zelensky feels he needs to deal with Trump and Trump seems to want to negotiate peace then a sudden, temporary escalation is probably not going to help Ukraine's position. If it becomes public that Biden has dropped the restrictions and Zelensky doesn't take advantage of it however, it may just weaken Zelensky's position.\n\nEDIT: Just to add due to the nature of politics, if Biden authorizes it then Trump's first action is probably going to be to restrict it again because Trump is unlikely to want something Biden did to be successful. If Zelensky wants long term relaxation of restrictions in the use of arms it will probably be more advantageous to wait for Trump to get in office so instead he can try to sell it as a 'win' to Trump and receive those benefits long term.",

There is no outcome in which Ukraine completely destroys Russia and forcibly ends the conflict. The conflict ends by settlement. And in doing so you want to push Russia just far enough so any prospective gain is too expensive, and the cost of backing out is far cheaper (economically, politically, etc.).\n\nIn extending aid in such a fast-paced way, you might actually tip the scales in favor of (from Russia's PoV) \"Ukraine is now too powerful, and we need to stay in this conflict longer for fear of reprisals with this new military power\". As you say, its much harder to take back that power (equipment, training, military experience, etc.).\n\nSo just to make a long point short, I think its totally in line with Biden's theory of the conflict to not destabilize the situation.

Both sides certainly are at a breaking point, and without American aid, I'm not sure how long Ukraine holds out. (And without European aid, its much sooner). But despite what some pundits tell you, the Russian economy and population are absolutely fucked atm. Their military industry has never been weaker. They've already had infighting, they were using golf carts to attack positions this year to conserve armored vehicles. Their exports are down, interest rates are at 20%, and military programs have been fully cut. Russia can't maintain an offensive with 1000+ casualties daily indefinitely. \n\nIf Biden wants to cause immediate change, I'd lift every restriction on American weapons save firing directly into Moscow. Russia would adapt no doubt, but even 3 months would cripple Russian logistics again in the short term.",

We're sending them older military equipment so that we no longer have to maintain them.  The monetary amounts you see us sending to Ukraine aren't actual US dollars, they're the cost of the equipment we're sending.  \n\nIndirectly, this helps our economy.  If we send Ukraine 1,000,000 rounds of ammunition, we'll need to replace them in our own inventories, unless these they were being marked for destruction.  Since this is America, I doubt we're outsourcing the creation of our Freedom Pebbles, so someone in this country is making the lead pointies.  That means more jobs for us.  \n\nI hate to defend the military industrial complex, but funding other people's wars via our equipment keeps Americans employed.  If we're going to be spending money on expensive military equipment, I would much prefer it be used to secure freedom for a would be ally than to sit moth balled and waiting for us to declare war on some intangible concept.",
         "Yep, something tangible. Lying apparently works, Trump said he cut taxes for everyone when he actually increased taxes on everyone making less than 300k after two years the last time he was in office. People are too disconnected from the political process to notice, or care. \n\nMy wife and I will be fine, we're both DINKs making well above the 400k mark. The tax cuts helped us, but we have friends and family that are in that income bracket that were negatively impacted by the tax changes and will be decimated by these tariffs and upcoming changes. They voted for Trump and think these changes will help lower prices for them. Gross misunderstanding of micro and macroeconomics.",

         "Russia can just turn the whole country into rubble, destroying all their power infrastructure, 32,000 drones a year means they can just target anything. You also have North Korean troops joining the fight which has the largest amount of troops on the planet and China producing military grade Garpiya-3 drones for them which we could see a lot more of once Trump gets into office and stops caring.\n\n...its over\n\nWith US aid its been a steadyish fight thats resulted in Ukraine slowly losing some ground and a lot of troops, with Ukraines military aid being halved overnight its going to be gruesome. Europe doesnt have the manufacturing capacity, wont be able to send any weapons with US components like stormshadows and are facing war fatigue themselves with the right gaining more popularity.",

They\u2019ve only just recently hit worrisome levels because many of these things take up to two years to rebuild and requires starting up a factory if you want more than just a small amount a year. \n\nAnd Ukraine can\u2019t win because the attrition numbers are entirely against them. They\u2019ve been on the losing side of the attrition for a while now. Russia has a war economy and hit max production, while having enormous more men to draw from, while just sitting back in a defense position allowing Ukraine to waste bodies trying to reclaim land. Now they are doing a sortie campaign, making ground, and will rinse and repeat.",

         "Russia doesn't have an infinite supply of people(Though north korea has been willing to donate) they are as vulnerable to attrition as any other country, they have been far behind the world economy for a long time, carried solely by oligarchs and their reputation. They haven't steamrolled this small country inspite of not only bordering that country, but being at least 10x the size.\n\nRussia is not as strong as they'd like everyone to think, take away Russia's nukes and they have nothing but land mass.\n\nThe only reason ukraine would lose the battle of attrition, is if the entirety of europe and the US gave up on it. Russia wins by convincing everyone that ukraine losing is worse than russia winning.",
         "Trump is awful, but until he calls Zelenskyy president putin, it\u2019s hard to compare.\u00a0",

Most of us just want a good economy, less government infringement and to be able to live our lives in peace. This time around, the majority decided Trump was better than Kamala to deliver on that but in 2020 the majority decided Biden was. There\u2019s a reason it constantly swaps between dem and republican because the majority aren\u2019t loyal to a specific party hence being centrists",
         "You may be right. It can't hurt to be more decisive.",
         "Everyone says that when they lose. Like chill my boy unless the world ends you always have a chance.",

Let's hope that it works out well for him; Trump doesn't give a crap about Ukraine, and can't be made to care.",

         "My really-out-there hope is that Trump has a secret grudge about being used by Putin and turns on him.\n\nAs we\u2019ve seen in this crazy new world of politics, no bad news seems to stick to him. So if Putin did \u201chave something\u201d on Trump, he can just cry fake news and carry on as usual.\n\nTrump absolutely backing Ukraine to the hilt would be wild to see.",

         "Best case sccenario: Trump delivers real firepower to ukraine in exchange for rebuilding contracts for us companies and mineral rights for us companies, pooptin is forced to retreat from ukraine. Trump can absolutely sell this as an overwhelming win and tell he singlehandedly ended the war PLUS strengthened the us economy and created jobs out of it. Putin can save his face by saying \"We retreated from Ukraine bc the de-nazification process was successful\", everyone knows anyway that he is full of shit. That would be the ebst case scenario imo",

Freezing is conceding to the enemy. All enemies love it when they attack, take what's yours and then the situation is \"frozen\", meaning they get to keep what they took.",

I had a man on the phone. I had the screen muted, no sound. I was talking to a very important man. Happens to be here and that very important guy, one of the most important people in, I would say the country actually. But you know, I was president and now it looks like I was going to be maybe president again, so I figured I could ask him to hold. So I asked him to hold. And because, especially because you\u2019re gonna be president again, they hold. So I took the phone down and I\u2019m looking the screen. I\u2019m seeing this crazy thing that\u2019s going around and coming down. It looks like it\u2019s gonna crash into the gantry. And I said, \u2018Oh, no.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Do me a favor. Do you mind holding for a couple of? I want to see this.\u2019\n\n\u201cI thought it was a Space Age movie or something. I put the phone down but I didn\u2019t pick it up for 45 minutes and he was holding. But this spaceship came down and I saw those engines firing and it looked like it was over. It was going to smash and then I saw the fire pour out from the left side and it put it straight. And it came down so gently and then it wrapped those arms around it. And it held it. And just like you hold your baby at night, your little baby. And it was a beautiful thing to see, and I called Elon, I said, \u2018Elon, was that you?\u2019 He said, \u2018Yes, it was.\u2019 I said, \u2018Who else can do that? Can Russia do it?\u2019 \u2018No.\u2019 \u2018Can China do it?\u2019\u2019 No.\u2019 \u2018Can the United States do it? Other than you?\u2019 \u2018No, nobody can do that.\u2019 I said, \u2018That\u2019s why I love you, Elon, that.\u201d",

In return, Ukraine received security assurances from the United States, Russia and Britain; compensation for the economic value of the highly-enriched uranium in the warheads (which could be blended down and converted into fuel for nuclear reactors); and assistance from the United States in dismantling the missiles, missile silos, bombers and nuclear infrastructure on its territory*",

Trump will withdraw troops from Europe and close bases on the way home. This will be irreversible. In the long run, this will harm the USA far more than it will cost the EU. Not to mention the fact that without close alliances with very similar values in the EU and the West, the USA will probably no longer have the weight it has now. I know far more countries that want the plague on the neck of the USA than, for example, on Germany or on Italy - and hey, Germany startet two world wars.

         "The only reporting I\u2019ve seen on it in our local media was mentioning Albanese (the prime minister) looked nervous during the press conference - this was in an article about him and the Australian ambassador to the US (former prime minister Kevin Rudd) walking back comments about Donald Trump.\n\nI do not want to have to verify that I\u2019m legally allowed to use social media. This sort of bullshit will not end with social media. I look forward to them similarly following with blocking pornography, and then whatever else in the name of protecting the children. I am only a few years into adulthood myself, and would and probably will work around this with a VPN or whatever other method. The government will at some point then go after VPNs, like how they tried to block tweets of the Bondi stabbings globally, because there was a \u201crisk\u201d Australians would be able to view them with a VPN.\n\nAustralia is terrible with protecting personal information. Between internet service providers and health insurance funds - people\u2019s information is leaked on a pretty regular basis. The question moves to how this is verified. I don\u2019t care to read the article (other than noting how it\u2019s by the BBC and not even local media.) \n\nDoes the government make the social media platforms responsible for this verification, like how certain US states have required a valid drivers license to visit PornHub? 16 year olds can gain a learner\u2019s permit from this age. Your ID is then linked to the social media account, removing your right to anonymity online. I don\u2019t care if they can data scrape and probably know who I am already. I don\u2019t want to give my ID to them so they know it, and can then leak it when they get hacked.\n\nOr does this system involve platforms needing to check in with the government through a government system, like MyGovID? Sure, then the platform doesn\u2019t need to know anything other than you are allowed to use it, but the government then needs to have your ID for purposes other than government services. I have a myGovID and use it for its government purpose. Needing to use such an ID for anything but is an overreach.\n\nKeep in mind, politicians tried to push for these social media companies to tie accounts to people because they were suing people on Twitter for defamation, and in some cases could not because the accounts were anonymous. \n\nI do not want to give social media platforms my ID. I do not want to give the government my ID for them to verify I can use social media platforms. I do not want my information leaked by the incompetence of Australian cyber security. I do not want legitimate services like social media (despite all its extreme faults) or VPNs in the name of protecting children. I do not want politicians to sue me for writing what they consider defamatory comments based on my honest opinion of the wrong things they do because my right to anonymity is removed. It is fucking ridiculous that this is something we have to be discussing. Protecting children should start with education which is shit in this country because successive governments fund private schools who also raise their own money and underfund the public system. Protecting children should start with the government funding public health services again which the government has not substantially increased funding on for a decade which has resulted in needing to pay to see a doctor now. \n\nProtecting children should be the responsibility of the parent, not 226 lawmakers in Canberra, and I say this as member of the governing party in this country. If parents cannot be bothered to protect their children by locking down their devices, or do so and not discovering their children have figured out ways around it, it\u2019s their fucking problem. I don\u2019t want it to be made mine, and have any of the above happen to me when I am not who is intended to be \u201cprotected.\u201d  Fuck Albanese.",

I work  in healthcare and I'm astounded at teens that are being bullied in whatever social media, and when asked why they don't just block them they look at you like you are insane for thinking that was even an option. \n\nThere was one girl who was sixteen and she was suicidal over being bullied, she could not get off her phone however and was just getting more and more upset whenever her phone pinged. We couldn't force her to turn her phone off or take her phone off her, we could only encourage her, we just had to watch her get drawn to her messages like a moth to a flame. We breathed a sigh of relief when her battery eventually died, and refused her requests for a charger. She needed to be protected from herself, and I fear that she is but one of a growing number of teens that need to be protected from themselves.\n\nParents need to shoulder some (or maybe quite a bit) of the blame here themselves - all too often they let their children alone with their phones, without any kind of guidance or supervision.

I hate this current social media of everyone has to be a vlogger or an influencer or try to sell you something.

         "Social media is a symptom of the ongoing caustic privatization of the internet. Not the cause. \n\nThe Internet and net neutrality has always been an annoyance of private companies. \n\nPrior to the smartphone the internet was neutral in the content it served. You had to search and discover on your own.\n\nPrivate companies were annoyed by this at best and actively fought it in other respects - data plans that favour certain content over others. \n\nBut the virtue of the original internet was that it kept the fringes of opinion at the fringes and hard to discover. \n\nThat gave the convos you had in the internet some level of legitimacy in that it was more proximate to real life. Even if extremes and fights of opinion happened, they didn't go viral and kingmake like they do now. \n\nWhen smartphones came about, it offered private companies the ability to make apps to carve out the internet into privatized money making silos. \n\nThey quickly realized that to make money they had to keep eyeballs in their silos. \n\nSo they invented algorithms to elevate content that kept users on platform (to maximize ad revenue) and all studies point to the fact that content that enrages is content that keeps people on platform. \n\nAs a consequence, the fringe Internet gradually became centrally elevated. Alex Jones was around in the early 2000s but was considered a total nutbar even in a lot of left and right active political forums. \n\nBut with apps and algorithms suddenly he's being pushed into regular people's feeds. \n\nThe unknowing who aren't aware of the dynamics and mechanics behind the data scenes start consuming that (fringe) garbage with the idea that it's being neutrally delivered ala traditional internet. So they took it at face value. \n\nThe growth of division was directly correlated to the trend of people using their phones to access the internet through apps versus traditional computer browser and now being fed fringe nonsense coded as mainstream ideas. \n\nSocial media is just the pronounced version of that. But the real culprit is the privatization of the internet masquerading as a \"neutral\" info delivery service. \n\nThe algorithms on most social media platforms were instituted by 2013 - which coincides with the radicalization and politicization of literally every facet of our lives. \n\nThe privatized Internet is a scourge (reddit included) and until regulations and laws catch up to recognize this, its going to get worse. \n\nSection 230 should be updated with harsh regulations around \"manipulated speech\" - any platform with an algorithm would be subject to direct liability for the effects of that algorithmic manipulation. \n\nAlgorithms are manipulated speech. Not free speech which section 230 is designed around. \n\nAs such it should not enjoy free speech protections beyond any private company that manipulates public opinion for profit.",

This [article](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-05-01/what-we-know-about-the-governments-online-age-verification-pilot/103791418) goes into it.\n\nIt was very unpopular and was rightly seen as an invasion of privacy that would open up potential issues of misuse of that data, blackmail etc. Picture having the entire history of someone\u2019s viewing habits linked to an ID and you can easily see why it\u2019s a shockingly bad idea. \n\nSo they waited a few months and brought in this new attempt under the guise of \u201cprotecting our children\u201d and banning the evils of social media because they know the whole \u201cwon\u2019t somebody think of the children?\u201d argument gets people on their side and gives them the moral high ground to tell anyone who doesn\u2019t support it that they are the bad person. It\u2019s essentially the same system as they originally proposed just casting a wider net and using a way more successful marketing strategy that governments around the world have been using for decades.\n\nIf you actually read the law they have been purposely vague in describing what websites and services are classed as social media. It\u2019s not just covering facebook, Instagram and TikTok but also things like discord, reddit and YouTube. It\u2019s so vague that it basically can be used to enforce ID requirements on ANY site where people gather together. \n\nYou can guarantee that they will come after apps like telegram, signal and WhatsApp which offer some level privacy to their users. If they can force ID verification across any social platform Aussies can say goodbye to the last shreds of digital privacy that existed, and it\u2019s likely that other countries will implement as well.",

There is no way for parents to decide what their kids can listen to - only spotify can do that. Your 12 year old must get on down to mary had a little lamb. While the cool kids are doing their thing, and our kids just end up with social anxiety.\n\nSome kids parents \"don't even care\", as you wrote. Kids do go to school with these kids. Having had, in some respects, strict parents I over compensated in, um, other, I would argue more dangerous and certainly currently illegal in Australia, ways. I would rather my kids when in their early teens watch tik toc than hang around with the rastas they are buying, um, things from like maybe a *friend* did when I was their age.\n\nSure, just give kids a dumb phone they cry. Yeah, so no music, video etc. No participation in a fuck load of significant culture for their generation.... ok?\n\nBasically, all the bullshit from before social media is still there, AND there is also social media to deal with too. There is no technical solution. There is no easy solution. I would not object to incredibly wealthy social media companies being fined to fuck if < 16 year olds access their service. Gives them a bit of incentive. I mean, seriously, fuck them.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I am not saying that parents do not have the by far the largest share of responsibility, but simply that it is not as easy as \"just use parental controls, man\".\n\n\nEDIT: add \"by far the\" to by far the largest share of responsibility.\n\nEDIT2: OTOH, the other my **8 year old daughter** sat down on her hand-me-down *spiny chair*, wrote a song, put it into suno.ai on her chromebook, amd dubbed her favorite result into a video she had taken of her and her friend playing roblox using capcut.

In 1970, political consultant Roger Ailes and other Nixon aides came up with a plan to create a new TV network that would circumvent existing media and provide \"pro-administration\" coverage to millions. \"People are lazy,\" the aides explained in a memo. \"With television you just sit \u2014 watch \u2014 listen. The thinking is done for you.\" Nixon embraced the idea, saying he and his supporters needed \"our own news\" from a network that would lead \"a brutal, vicious attack on the opposition.\"\n\nIt might have taken them a few decades but Roger Ailes pulled it off with funding from Murdoch who in turn created his own Australian/global conservative media empire. \n\nAnd of course Reagan repealed the Fairness Doctrine in 1987 after vetoing congress who were trying to stop the FCC from overturning it.

I mean do you think that before that collapse that the west were just propping up Korea, Taiwan, Japan, Singapore, etc, as a way to trick communist nations like China and Vietnam in to becoming slaves to western economics? If that were the case then why didn\u2019t their economies collapse after the Cold War and it no longer made sense pay for their decadence? My answer is that it wasn\u2019t a lie. The west always wanted a prosperous Asia and it was Russia that wanted to exploit you. The west embraced former Soviet aligned nations like China and Vietnam because we want you to lead happier lives. \n\nI mean hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese were killed by Vietnamese before the west tried to intervene. And on some level I agree the eventual conscription to intervene was probably a mistake given the disregard that people forced to fight a war they don\u2019t believe would have. But just a decade after the axis forces committed similar acts of inhumanity the Vietnamese communists were massacring people. Were we supposed to just stand by and watch that happen? Especially given the resulting poverty that ensued under Soviet influence? I\u2019m glad life is getting better in Vietnam now.

They all want to keep Russia out. Even now after Russia turned all of eastern Ukraine to rubble.\n\nAs for NATO it\u2019s a defensive treaty. Why do you think that Russia does not like defence treaties? Why do you think Ukraine might want to join one? Why is it any of Russias business what treaties Ukraine should sign? Is it okay for Russia to treat Ukraine as an imperial colony in this way? Is Russia not being honest when it claims to not be an empire any more? What happened to all those Asian regions that Russia annexed? Why isn\u2019t Russia fighting for their freedom?"

This is no different than assuming that Afghanistan is the way it is just because of a cadre of wiley fundamentalists, rather than observing the history of intervention and systemic penury in the region. This really is a Hallmark of neoliberal confabulation. \n\nI don't speak of some unscrupulous gentlemen xD. I speak of some uneducated, violent young guys equipped with Kalashnikovs that endure so unbelievably horrific living conditions that a coup attempt is worth dying for.\n\nAfghanistan isn't the graveyard of empires, a lot of historic empires were able to conquer and thrive in it...\n\n>Yet, miraculously, the softer disposition of the Western states grants this leeway? I'm not sure where the logic is. \n\nWe try to make help and assistance depend on universal values. Thats more treasure for the dictator to supplement his cronies with.\n\n>When the military and economic 'alliances,' between these countries are established, on what grounds and guarantees do you imagine they are established? Is the internal security of the population not one? I mean, if you want to suggest that they practically don't matter insofar as resource extraction and labor exploitation are the goals, then I agree. However, to suggest that this is only the case with Russia is fairly silly, and obviously the result of using African states as another chip of argumentation against Russian geopolitics. Again, the idea that it's just about \"someone in the military\" is vacuum thinking, it's putting all power of causality in a particular instance (the instance of the cunning militant who weighs his options) without examining just how this is a possibility in the first place. \n\nI examined why this is a possibility in the first place. \nYou don't even need labor exploitation with resource deposits. If you can just import foreign workers to extract and build, you have the cruelest and most stable regimes imaginable. The local population doesn't matter, because the human capital of the population isn't enough to provide for a power base in institutions.\n\n>Beyond the fact that the CIA ABSOLUTELY has an internally documented track record of meddling within the 20th century, I have no interest in considering the CIA in these cases. I am not \"crying CIA\" here, frankly I don't need to.\n\nIt was an example.

The young dare not speak out against the old, women dare not speak out against men. Of course this is changing, but I think that your takeaway here is incorrect. Familial shame doesn't make any society safer, rather it empowers those who pose danger to society and intimidates those who, through no fault of their own, are outside the default power structure.\n\nI say this because, regardless of whether or not a crime is reported by a family member, it still brings shame on the family as a whole.

         "Excerpt from the article:\n\n\n_Resettling or permanently reoccupying Gaza is not official Israeli policy, but senior Israeli defence officials recently told the Israeli daily Haaretz that *with no other alternatives on the table, the government is aiming to annex large parts of the territory.*_",
         "This is the Hebrew Kan article fully translated. It's Hebrew article cited in the Guardian link:\u00a0\n\n\n\"Northern Gaza is being\u00a0 emptied. The IDF says: not related to the general's plan\n\n\nAccording to IDF sources, this time there is no intention to allow the residents of the northern Gaza Strip to return to their homes and that humanitarian aid will regularly enter the southern Gaza Strip.\u00a0\n\n\nThe security establishment estimates today (Tuesday) that more than 55,000 civilians fled from Jabaliya, after Hamas prevented them from evacuating in the first days of the activity in the northern Gaza Strip. The IDF says they gathered evidence that Hamas physically harmed residents who wanted to leave and also executed people. Currently the IDF estimates that there are only hundreds of civilians left in Jabalia.\n\n\nDivision 162 operates in Jabaliya under the command of Brigadier General Itzik Cohen, where within 48 hours they succeeded in severing the connection between Gaza City and the north of the Gaza Strip.\n\n\nSince the operation began in Jabaliya, 700 surrendered terrorists have been arrested, including dozens of terrorists who participated in the massacre on October 7 at the Erez crossing and the Black Arrow monument and have since provided intelligence information in their investigations. A thousand terrorists were eliminated during the operation. According to a senior commander, it can be seen in the last few days that \"the enemy escaped\" from Jabaliya and that last night almost 50 terrorists were killed in ambushes and sniper fire.\n\n\n\"You see an enemy who is desperate for his life, acting in a guerilla fashion and looking for opportunities.\" Brigadier General Cohen said. According to the IDF, the operation in Jabaliya is troubling Hamas and the activity is intended, among other things, to produce tools for further negotiations for the release of the abductees in the era after Yahya Sinwar.\n\n\nA senior IDF official who is familiar with the programs in Jabaliya said that he is not familiar with the initiative known as the \"General's Plan\" and that he is only acting according to the instructions of the General Staff and the approval of the Chief of Staff.\n\n\nThe refugee camp is trapped by Hamas with dozens of explosive devices designed to trap IDF soldiers. So far, 200 trapped houses have been located. The IDF says that during combat, they develop exercises with the aim of reducing harm to the fighters, including the use of technology, dogs, and the use of anti-aircraft guns building before entering the buildings.\n\n\nThe IDF estimates that only thousands of people remain in the central centers in the northern Gaza Strip: between 1,000 and 3,000 in Beit Lahia and 1,000 in Jabaliya. The IDF says that after entering Jabaliya twice in the past, this time there is no intention of allowing the residents of the northern Gaza Strip to return to their homes and that Humanitarian aid will regularly enter the southern Gaza Strip - since there are no more civilians left north of Gaza City.\n\n\nSenior IDF officials were asked if there is a decision to split the northern Gaza Strip into two parts, Gaza City and the northern neighborhoods, and they answered that the decision is to cut off the northern Gaza Strip from Gaza City.\n\n\nReferring to the claims of harming civilians, Brigadier General Cohen emphasized: \"The IDF is a moral and ethical army. We are working in this operation in a significant way to allow the population to move south while risking our lives. Hamas uses civilians as a significant center of gravity, threatens them and shoots under their protection. Just yesterday At night, shots were fired from a hospital at Givati \u200b\u200bforce.\"",

He added that humanitarian aid would be allowed to \u201cregularly\u201d enter the south of the territory but not the north, since there are \u201cno more civilians left\u201d.\n\nAccording to [this Haaretz article](https://archive.is/dCOt7) they've also destroyed all housing:\n\n> In Al-Attara and Beit Lahia there isn't a single house that people could return to and live in.

He has made his stand clear that he wants industry, especially strategically important ones, to be developed and built in the U.S.; however, his method of pushing for this would be through heavy tariffs for anything not built in America.",
         "SpaceX is not doing that.  If they were, they would not be pressuring the chips to be made outside Taiwan and threatening to stop buying the chips if they aren't. \n\nThe chips act doesn't say that, and it's not in the spirit of the law either. You should listen to what Biden has said about it, rather than what right wing media is trying to tell you it's about.  The USA will always buy chips from Taiwan.  They are the cheapest and best. That's not going to change with the chips act.  All the act did was incentivize the USA to start making them in case all chips from Taiwan stop abruptly bc of war.",

Whether anyone likes it or not the situation between Taiwan and China is trending towards uncertainty and possible conflict in the next decade if not sooner. \n\nIt would be extremely irresponsible to allow manufacturing of the most important piece of technology in the world to remain on an island that is expected to be at war. \n\nNot to mention all the other benefits that come with being able to have full chip manufacturing capabilities in a country that up until now has had basically none. \n\nThe long term goal of building Fabs in the US was always to replace the supply coming from Taiwan.",

         "I'm pretty sure he's not anti-Taiwan, but rather pro-money.",
         "My understanding is Taiwan is years ahead of everyone, in both capacity and power of the chips they can make.  The USA is years away from full replacement.  And I doubt they would ever fully move from Taiwan anyway.  The chips will always be cheaper from Taiwan, like most things vs USA made.",
         "China owns 100x more treasuries than Taiwan.",
         ">The chips will always be cheaper from Taiwan, like most things vs USA made.\n\nThe reason why a lot of products would be expensive if they are made in the US vs outside the US is because a difference in wages between US and non US workers. However chips do not have this relationship because wages make up a tiny fraction of the cost in producing a chip. US made chips will be pretty much exactly the same in price as chips made in Taiwan or anywhere else.\n\nTaiwan is leading the current research and development when it comes to make chips and its TSMC company makes the most advanced chips on the planet. The TSMC Fabs being built in the US will be manufacturing those very chips and there won't be a quality difference. They have already started production of the A chips being used in the current iphones.\n\nWhat Taiwan isn't doing is giving the US the skilled labourers in their R&D departments, but just having these factories in the US producing chips means that there will be more US workers upskilling to work in these factories. So in a couple of years the US will be at the same level just by having these factories set up in the country.\n\nNot to mention if conflict does break out who do you think will be the first group of people the US will give citizenship to? If you guessed Taiwanese chip researchers you get a point.",
         "Sure. Years away. Which means the replacement process has to start now since China is also only \"years away\" from being able to militarily invade Taiwan. There's a reason they are starting now. You don't wait until bombs start falling and landing craft are on beaches to begin.",
         "iPhone chips are not the same thing as the ones for super computers, etc. iPhone  chips have  been made by other manufacturers in the past.  \n\nRight , this is all for the invasion scenario.  Where did anyone in the Biden gov say they were not going to buy the chips unless they were manufactured in the USA?  That's not the point of the act. Biden has said this several times to assuage  the Taiwan government.",
         "Wages are a huge part of the chipmaking cost! Don\u2019t know how long it takes to make a 7nm ready water?!? A lot can take months, and you need humans to watch/fix the machines the whole way.",
         "You are making up facts. The US factories are not as small a nanometer build as the core Taiwanese ones.",
         "Right, but that's not what SpaceX is saying.  They are demanding the components be made outside Taiwan (and not the USA).  Or he won't buy them. \n\nThe chips acts as supplements Taiwan made chips.  It doesn't replace them.",
         "I\u2019m also not factoring in r and d cost\u2026. Which takes place overseas for a lot of pieces  of a design.",

Buy our car instead\"\n\nIf a \"base\" model could have actual base level equipment, it would help costs (instead of a tablet style display, just a normal old AV unit with knobs), but then you're significantly adding costs to the manufacturer to have different AV systems and trim options that may not even make up a significant portion of their sales.

One is full vassalization of EU by USA, we are well on our way to that outcome. The second is, giving EU its own independent strategic command, a federal army, and an European MIC.

Let me be clear: Any use of nuclear weapons in this conflict on any scale would be completely unacceptable to us as well as the rest of the world and would entail severe consequences.\"\n\n'Severe consequences' in this context is deliberately vague, in accordance with [Policy of deliberate ambiguity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy_of_deliberate_ambiguity).\n\nSo, you're technically correct. He didn't say it's an option, but he left the question hanging.\n\n[The Official policy section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction) is worth a read as well as \"Failure to retaliate\" way at the bottom.\n\nI also highly recommend Dan Carlin's Countdown to Armageddon if you haven't heard it already."

They leave the decision to the user, with the warning that their data is compromised and recommendation to not download or use the app at all.\u00a0\n\n\nNot sure how it addresses national security risks in any way though, considering the govt already has a ban on the app for any govt devices.",

Then for some reason it'll show me a video calling all Jews cockroaches (more frequently if I'm engaging with any content about the ongoing Israel-Gaza conflict). Then I report the video for hatespeech, leave a comment calling the creator a stupid bigot, and six hours later TikTok tells me that the video doesn't violate their community standards but I'm getting a community strike for my apparently horrendous comment.\n\nI'm generally able to keep hatespeech off of my FYP but holy hell the TikTok content moderation team is the biggest group of antisemites around. I have never had a report for hatespeech accepted on even the most wildly antisemitic, holocaust denying content. Yesterday it pushed a clip from Schindler's List at me, and there were a dozen comments that were just outright holocaust denial. I reported every single one and TikTok came back and said that every single one wasn't in violation of their community standards.\n\nIt's so bad I'm kind of shocked that Germany hasn't started a criminal prosecution against them.",

It can quite literally lift personal information about you.\n\nTikTok (I don\u2019t have it, never have) seems like it\u2019s more like a mini video situation, like YouTube. Not quite social media either. But the difference being here that the company is in bed with a hostile state actor and can lift information from your device, allegedly. \n\nOverall I agree that social media sucks, and is a detriment to society. I hate how so many years ago I fell into the trap of MySpace and never looked back. Ignorance was bliss.",

Honestly I think you have to be very young to hold this kind of opinion, because anybody who was around and on proto-social media 20-25ish years ago (e.g., the halcyon days of Fark, even pre-Digg)  can tell you how far left society has gone on most issues over the past quarter century as the Internet and social media has wormed its way into everyone's lives.\n\nThere may have been a slight rightward swing over the last couple of years, but it's nothing compared to the leftward swing between 2000-2020.",

Social media is a massive political radicalization machine.\n\nPrior to social media you had to fit in with the people around you, you couldn't just find a group of friends who all think that birds are government spy drones and that the world is flat.

The government saying that TikTok meets the standard under the law is not due process. Due process would require at minimum some kind of hearing before an impartial judge or adjudicator where TikTok's owners could address the evidence and arguments of the government that they meet the standard in the law and could rebut, argue against, or enter their own evidence to support the notion that they do not meet that standard. The proceeding could very well conclude that they do meet the standard on the basis of all the evidence and arguments presented, but due process requires you have the opportunity to fairly defend yourself on the basis that the government sometimes makes mistakes when applying the law.",

There's rules, Reddits agenda, but in general as long as it's not obscenely depraved, it goes. In one way echo chambers are just a good thing, they're in the open and allowed to do their own thing without mixing in with the larger community. If they pull their shit in an unrelated community, they're downvoted to hell.

For lobbying, paying for somebody to do it from overseas is classified as foreign lobbying, and a registry of all of these agents is in the works. This is more likely given the US election and the question of tariffs back on the table.",

I don't endorse sending your data to China or subjecting yourself to algorithmic brainwashing, I have never used nor will I ever be using TikTok, but this is one of those things that is an actual slippery slope. Once you start banning websites without direct, clearcut evidence of wrongdoing or illegal material, anything is on the chopping block. Anything can be cut down if it benefits the government. And if you get a government that benefits from censorship and propaganda, and has the will to enforce means to achieve them? There would be nothing standing in the way, no moment of outrage when bans are announced, no chance for clarity and counteraction. Just another day, another website blocked.",

Basically it's very illegal for PET to use the surveillance data on Danish citizens if they gather it directly without a warrent. It's not illegal, however, if our Government lets the NSA get direct access to our core internet nodes and then share the data through the various international cooperation agreements.\n\nIronically the scandal had nothing to do with any of that. It had to do with the boss of our SEKRIT military intelligence (FET) having possibly having told his mother about it during some family dinner. We never really found out because the case was dropped by the PET when the courts denied their request to keep the trial closed from the public.\n\nAnyway. Anything you put into the Internet is accessible. Your option is to chose which governments get it, assuming it doesn't get intercepted along the way... Which it probably does.",
         "Idk if you have any more idea about it than me on how your data is used . Facebook just yesterday had another drama about their data (I forgot in what country and what they do with your data ) but it\u2019s ok because it\u2019s not a contest . The government has installed \u201ctaps\u201d everywhere so they can spy and gather your data so yes they have your Facebook data but not only that , most all of your data from everywhere to be honest . But his simple idea that China is super evil and the west or America is super good is grossly simplified and hypocrite tbh . It\u2019s like a bad simple movie . In a good one fb and google etc should also have stuff that are banned .

It is a threat to their wallets. \n\nIt\u2019s not because of foreign adversaries meddling with the American people. If that were a big concern, there would be congressional hearings about Twitter, Musk, and his contact with Putin. Facebook accepted responsibility for helping perpetuate a genocide. \n\nMost of what I get on my TikTok feed is non-political because I don\u2019t interact with it there.",

         "It\u2019s maybe one of my hottest takes, but I don\u2019t think the government is necessarily as worried about who TikTok is owned by because of the information they can lift from it as they put on. The government and Meta/Twitter are mostly envious of the technology and it siphoning away the data that THEY have access to because people are leaving those platforms. \n\nIf we were truly worried about foreign influence through social media, the next president of the US is cozying up with an illegal immigrant overstayed his visa (allegedly) who has also been having known conversations with Putin. \n\nNot saying Chinese influence isn\u2019t a a security concern, but Russia is doing what everyone thinks China is doing pretty openly on Twitter. There has been a direct conduit of Putin on campaign rally stages running an illegal contest literally buying votes.",
         "Are you aware that the US has banned Huawei, a Chinese cell phone company, because of the egregious spying done through it? TikTok is no different. It\u2019s not about \u201cbanning social media platforms\u201d, it\u2019s about banning *foreign owned spying devices and programs*. National security is a real concern, especially with global tensions as high as they are right now.",
         "If another nation is using their platform in your country to push propaganda you should ban it.  \nPeople are generally too stupid to make good decisions regarding things like tik tok.

Now they'll just buy it from their US or some other subsidiary instead of their Canadian subsidiary.",
         "Agree with you, I think a lot of discussion happened around tiktok when us gov asked to sell it, so it's good that we haven't given in especially considering musk and trump with twitter could be easy way to start doing whatever they want but also when it comes to national security it's always better to take action when it's just suspicion because china has been caught sneaking agents into Boeing to steal secrets and caught with recording devices on cranes in American ports, but yeah we have to push back if it's too much done without any proof",
         "Aiding a hostile and adversarial nation is someone's right? Especially aiding a hostile nation that has credible evidence of influencing members of gov't and elections? I'm not sure compromising national security even if unintentional is a right.",

         "> The only reason why TikTok has been demonized the way it has been by politicians and mainstream media is because they see superior technology eating away at their user base\n\nNo, the political reason for it is that the parent company, ByteDance, is doing AI research for China.  Politicians are trying to slow China's development on AI under the false pretence of \"protecting user data\".  Same thing they did to Huawei, who was supplying the hardware.  If they were really worried about security of technology owned by Chinese companies, Lenovo should have been far ahead of the line before getting to Huawei.  They're also preventing the sale of chips or any technology to Huawei.  Does that sound like a security issue?",
         "It's not even superior tech. Maybe they have better algos, but FB and Twitter were always able to pull of the same idea. TikTok just got there first.",

         "I think everybody caught on very fast on just how bad it was that Musk took over Twitter, but at this point, I wonder how many of us recognised the true extent of the damage something like that could do - on a *global* scale. I'm fresh out of an article detailing how Trump's next four years in the office will kill any hopes of managing to limit the rise in global temperature to the crisis level of 1,5 degrees, and it's truly wrecking me to know that a few men can doom an entire planet by manipulating and brainwashing just one half of just one country's population.\n\nBut in terms of TikTok, it's a double-edged blade; it is doing what Twitter has done, and free access allows it to continue brainwashing people everywhere, and spreading the kind of propaganda that benefits the causes of evil men. Limiting access to it *by* governments, however, just gives a different government more tools to control people's access to good and unbiased information - limits the free choice of people to critically choose their platforms, the sources they get their information from.\n\nI don't trust either of these parties. Governments change, and a good one now making choices to protect freedom will eventually be exchanged for a bad one, who will use those choices to limit freedom. Unlimited freedom, on the other hand, allows crowdthink to power up the kinds of propaganda and delusional, detached nonsense that has fed the whole of the Trump movement. We truly are sheep and there's no way out of this one, is there?",

         "??? \nSince when was there rules on what you can/can't comment on? \nI saw your comment and responded. \n\nThough with an attitude like that, you're not making a good case of reddit and reddit users being any better.",

Why are we letting CCP controlled social media into Canada when China won't let western social media or even internet access there? \n\nIf nothing else this is just a digital version of the opium wars of the 1800s.\n\n>the rest of Canada can protect themselves.\n\nSo no need for the government to do anything else? No laws, legislation, regulations or federal authorities? I could get behind a bit more anarcho-capitalism in Canada. Let's start with castle doctrine and go from there.",
         ">by your definition\n\nI didn't define anything.\n\n>US would be #1 adversarial nation to just about every country in the world, due to their frequent intervention(even violent ones) in foreign politics.\n\nWhataboutism. I said hostile and adversarial. The US uses soft power to influence other countries to their benefit and often for regional stability. If they are using their soft power to their benefit it could be seen as a contentious issue but not open hostility. \n\nHowever I was talking specifically about Canada and China and no the US is not in the same category as China in terms of hostility to Canada.\n\n>from a parent perspective, it is my job to inform my kids\n\nSorry a legal system of rights and laws cannot be simplified to parents letting their kids make mistakes. National security cannot be equated to letting people figure it out themselves. \n\nGenerally speaking you are free in western countries to do dangerous things such a skydiving or rock climbing. You want to take personal risks? Fine. You want to endanger everyone else? Not fine. \n\nAsk yourself would China allow unfettered social media from the US or the West to be spread around there? Of course not. So why should we, the West, allow them to do that here?",

I (and many others) can claim the same in terms of mental health rather than sexuality.\n\nThe crux of the issue is that social media represents a unique opportunity to see and interact with PEOPLE. It is so much easier to spread lies and vitriol against groups when they\u2019re just an idea, but look, this YouTuber is trans, the writer of this song you like is lesbian, they\u2019re living breathing beings with hopes and dreams and thoughts and feelings just like you.

Are you under the impression that representation comes cheap or something?\u00a0\n\n\nIt's interesting that you bring up terror charges though, because there's a reason those people are usually represented. Per our criminal process law, representation is mandatory for offenses where the maximum penalty exceeds a certain jail time threshold.

         "The stock piles are long gone too.\n\nThe crazy thing is both the US and Russia promised to defend Ukraine in exchange for Ukraine giving up any nukes it still had and the production of nukes that Russia left in the country when Ukraine gained back its freedom and independence from Russia.\n\nThis ensured to Russia that Ukraine would not have the weapons/ability to retaliate against Russia and the US/NATO would be ensured that during a time of instability in Ukraine while the country was trying to rebuild its own government that the weapons were not sold off to some terrorist organization, or ended up under the control of a hostile Ukrainian government if any future Ukraine government was considered a rogue government.\n\nAt the time, the negotiations made excellent sense.  A win for everyone.\n\nUntil Russia decided that it wanted Ukraine back under Russian control.\n\nThe US was then forced to try to defend Ukraine, as promised, as best it could, without starting a full on, all out war, with Russia.\n\nNOT supporting Ukraine would mean that the US was not a true ally, but was a country that would make promises to get what it wanted, and then would refuse to keep those promises when the time came to actually fulfill what they promised.  How many allies does anyone think that the US would have if it did shit like that?\n\nOne of the problems with Trump is that he is and always has been a very transactional person.  If you can do for him, he likes you and will help.  If you are no use to him, he will cut you loose and let you live or die on your own, regardless of any promises that were made.\n\nThis was abundantly clear when he tried to blackmail/extort Zelensky and Ukraine for dirt on a political opponent when he was in office the first time, and for which he was Impeached the first time.\n\nZelensky and Ukraine have nothing that Trump wants this time. Trump has made it clear time and time again over the past 4 years that Ukraine and Russia need to resolve this themselves, without the help of the US, regardless of any promise that was made to Ukraine to help them defend themselves.\n\nHe is perfectly willing to have the US destroy and go back on promises that were made because Trump will personally get nothing from helping.\n\nTrump promised to support and pay for the defense of his own supporters if they fought for him and got in legal trouble. They tried, and failed. And once they failed, they were no longer of any use for him, so he went back on his word/promise.\n\nWhile he could not pardon any of the Jan 6th idiots since none had been convicted of any crimes before he left office the first time, but he COULD have spent part of the past 4 years helping to raise money for lawyers for them. He didn't.  The transaction was over. They were no longer any use for him. They would have to \"live or die\" on their own.\n\nWith Trump winning again, Ukraine has to face the very real possibility that the US will demand that Zelensky negotiate some type of peace agreement with Russia or have all aid from the US cut off.\n\nWhile peace IS the ultimate goal, without the support of the US, Ukraine has very diminished negotiating power and Russia can ask for anything and everything it wants, up to and including complete surrender and dismantling of the entire Ukraine independent government and full re-annexation of the entire region back under Russia control.\n\nTrump HATES NATO because the US is the largest contributor to NATO and Trump believes that all of the other NATO countries should not solely rely on the US for assistance and defense.\n\nDoes anyone really think NATO allies are going to be willing to stand in defense of Ukraine if Trump pulls all support for them?  The way Trump is, he would retaliate against our NATO allies by pulling support again for NATO and refusing to spend any more money or resources towards NATO and any NATO allies.",

That primed how I was seeing this whole discussion, even though this particular comment chain actually has no mention of that.\n\nSeen through that light, I hope you can see how it didn't immediately come off to me as insane to suggest Ukraine would build a nuclear weapons program from scratch.  Once Russia wasn't actively making war on Ukrainian soil, developing nukes would actually be a pretty good deterrent from Russia ever trying to invade again.\n\nSimilarly, if I had been accurately addressing the scenario in this comment chain, my comment would imply Ukraine was going to build a nuke from start to finish in, what, 3 months?  Predicting development time is a weakness of mine as an engineer, but I know damn well 3 months is not enough.  But with a 4- or 8- or 10- year ceasefire?  Not so crazy... at least, in my mind",

I guess what I would want to clear up is in definitions of words:\n\n- when you say \"fissile material\", it sounds like you mean \"sufficiently enriched fissile material\".  I was more meaning it in the sense that viable uranium ore is not present in every country, and getting a supply chain requires either having domestic production available, or having enough global sway to get it.  Clearly, Ukraine already has uranium.\n\n- I suppose I'm not 100% clear what the exact cutoff is for a \"threshold state\".  I fear that my comment was taken to mean I think Ukraine is months, rather than years from being able to develop a weapon.  What I meant, with the caveat of all the things I might not know, was more along the lines that Ukraine is years, not decades away.  Would you agree or disagree with this latter statement?\n\n>Ukraine nuking Russia is how WW3 starts\n\nAgreed, but as with any country, the point of a nuke is not to use it -- it's a bargaining chip and a deterrent.\n\n>I highly doubt anyone would be willing to sell \n\nI wouldn't 100% rule it out.  Honestly, in spite of his connection with Putin, I ironically could see Trump selling Ukraine nukes for the right price.  \n\n>Ukraine doesn't have the time, money or material to develop nuclear weapons and\n\nI am also sort of conflating this with another comment chain, which I see you also replied to me on, where someone said Ukraine could take advantage of a several-year ceasefire to develop nukes as a deterrent.  I agree that, in a wartime footing, they do not have the resources to spare for a from-scratch weapons program.  I'm more interested in the question of what they could do with several years of uneasy peace.  I have a couple more questions:\n\n- your other comment heavily emphasized fast breeder reactors, but these aren't completely necessary for weapons, are they?  Isn't enrichment to weapons-grade possible with centrifuges alone?\n\n- I do leave myself open to the argument that other nations could cut off Ukraine's supply of uranium if they detected weapons-development activities (and they would detect it.  That's where we're juuuust starting to overlap with things I *am* an expert in).  My question is, couldn't they get the necessary fissile material from nuclear waste, which I assume they have plenty of?\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nThis comment is already long, so there's no harm in making it longer by one end note.  I know I may come across as argumentative when I also clearly have plenty to learn on this topic.  That's really just part of my learning style, and I am listening to what you say, but I also have to address it when I hear a detail that doesn't sound quite right -- if anything, it means I'll be paying extra attention if you do counter me on that detail I disagreed with",

They decided to give the nukes away. Sure Ukraine could still have keept the nukes.

They could at least start a showing of good faith by not paying kidnappers of Israeli civilians and turning them into national heroes after they murder the captured foreign nationals. Or stop the \"solidarity\" attacks on isreali civilians when the idf goes to attempt to rescue hostages and prosecute the abductors.\n\nPart of the problem is that gazans really had the impression that 2014 was some sort of actual war to the isrealis, and not them holding back emensely. But palestinian deaths are celebrated as holy martyrs anyway, so it's hard for isreal to dissuade further attacks by limited force when they care equally for militant/terrorist deaths as they do for the accidental or collateral damage inflicted on their civilians, and treat all isrealis as Jewish occupiers, not just the idf, and thus targets. It's not hard to see why israel feels now that the only way forward to a peaceful solution is to demonstrate that hamas, or any jihad-based governing structure, will never be able to succeed in their aims, let alone thrive in their own feifdom as long as their policy towards israel is that of encouraging and enacting indirect fire, missile, kidnapping, and mass murder campaigns against civilians specifically. This is how some isrealis even justify settlements, because if they're going to be attacked and killed anyway, might as well give israel more strategic depth and control over a sworn to violence enemy.\n\nThe more hamas/pij/hezbollah gets outside encouragement, the worse off isrealis and Palestinians alike will have it.",

Incidentally, this sort of same staggering incompetence is what *saved* Hitler during the July '44 plot to have him assassinated. People always think the solid oak table is what saved him, and it genuinely did, but people also forget that there was an entire coordinated effort by many in the German Army to make this an an actual operation, including radioing out messages that Hitler was dead and then taking control of certain regiments, detachments and military installations. Well, in this instance, some genius forgot to disconnect the phone line of the room that (I believe it was Goebbels was staying in? Himmler? I can't remember). And they were able to place phone calls and tell people to stop the troop movements because Hitler wasn't dead (so they had found out). This lapse in judgement killed the plot in its tracks because so many of the troop detachments were following a plan put in place in case of Hitler's assassination/death in which so-and-so would assume command after that fact. That screw-up lead to thousands of people tortured to death, with many of these tortures being filmed for Hitler's personal viewing pleasure whenever he felt like it. \n\nWhile the Wehrmacht certainly played an absolutely direct role in the genocide on the Eastern Front and of the Jews, Slavs and Romani; this particular \"episode\" (re: plot) was actually a moral-revolt from within the Germany Army, who felt disgusted and dishonorable at the actions they themselves committed and were being ordered to commit by people higher up in the military high command. We have explicit instructions from people in the Wehrmacht high command giving-the-ok to exterminate the \"Eastern populations\". Incidences of alcoholism and suicide were so high in the SS, and army group populations that took to the slaughter, that this is where Himmler started coming up with ideas on how to efficiently and quickly \"Liquidate\" populations of people (re: gas camps).

Now? Well, hopefully the materials can still be locked up, but we all have our doubts about that.\u201d Obtaining sufficiently enriched fissile material could be difficult but, when it comes to creating the bomb, \u201cIt turns out it\u2019s not overwhelmingly difficult.

Personally i don't think they would want to even acknowledge that its happened because it would show a kink in their nuclear armour as such i think if this happened anciently they would downplay it or just ignore it.\n\nIF however Ukraine was to start a deliberate campaign of trying to target Russian nuclear weapons in a move to either disable or weaken the Russian Nuclear deterrent then that would be a nuclear provocation and could be a casus belli for a nuclear response. Probably why Ukraine haven't been doing it i would imagine that they've been told through back channels that if they start that shit, Russia is going to respond.",

         "What?\n\nLots of nukes have been testee in the open, in russia and other places..",
         "When you read up on the use of nuclear weapons there is some debate about what a \"tactical\" nuke is a or if it is what exactly constitutes a \"tactical\" nuke.  There is a general understanding that \"tactical\" means some kind of battlefield nuke, its not about size so much as it is about how it is used for example a 100kt nuke on a military base could be tactical. Strategic nukes are usually thought of as being the \"city killers\" the nukes that are used to force your opponent to capitulate and end a war the debate comes into play because many point out that the use of ANY nuke could have the impact hence all nukes are strategic. So i am not going to disagree with you on your claim that there is no such thing as a \"tactical nuke\" just pointing out its very debatable. \n\nI do have to disagree with you on what comes next. \n\n>Any modern nuke that close to Russian would effect a climate catastrophe big enough to effectively end modern life (food runs out basically)\n\nSo modern nukes are actually smaller than the nukes tested in the 50's and 60's, the largest was Tsar Bomba at about 50 megatons to put that into perspective most modern nukes yields are measured in kilotons. Interestingly to go back to your \"what is a tactical nuke\" debate some attribute arbitrary numbers and will say less than 50kt is tactical, anything else is strategic.  Regardless my point is this, most nukes these days measure in the Kt range, there are some that creep into the Mt range but nothing like Tsar Bomba. \n\nNow the Russians tested Tsar Bomba in 1961 and it did not cause a huge earth shattering climate catastrophe. Furthermore modern nukes don't have the same radiation problem, the modern hydrogen bombs just don't carry as much of a radiation problem (Insert asterisk). So your claim that \"Any modern nuke\" would cause some kind of climate catastrophe is 100% unfounded meaning that you don't need to loose sleep at night worrying that one nuke is going to clear out world food supply. \n\nWhat i think you might be talking about is a nuclear winter but that involves a full exchange of multiple nuclear weapons, ie nuclear war and its a very different situation to what we are talking about here.",
         "Sorry, you\u2019re entirely incorrect. You have to consider that a state like Russia, Iran, NK, or China, is already under such constant and massive surveillance, that any attempts of smuggling nuclear weapons in cars across not only Europe, but to the U.S as well, is completely ridiculous. Like, fine, nothing is 100% secure and accurate, but the likelihood of Russia being able to use their entire stockpile when they have no mechanisms to launch is quite frankly sensationalist and ridiculous.\n\nOkay, so the off-chance is that you get one warhead through *somehow*, the chance of it being a one off are so high because of the amount of measures in place to detect things like nuclear warheads in transit and the success rate of intelligence. You\u2019re conflating the above with known methods of explosive delivery which is far less regulated, and more commonly used by extremist/insurgent organisations in asymetric warfare. In short, you are not going to see a hundred Ladas with nuclear warheads in the boot scurrying across the world to start a nuclear war.",
