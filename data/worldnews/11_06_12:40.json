         "Respect to Russia. Who would have guessed the most successful warfare operation is to put 5000 guys on minimum wage into an opinion/troll factory.",
         "The Russians are getting an unbelievably good deal for their money.",
         "And now the dominos really start toppling",
         "Well the EU needs their own Marshall plan, a strong defence and develop new partners around the world. We can not hide behind UN resolutions, the US defence, and only go for the short time cash. That is for sure. \n\nVoters of Europe, no matter right or left, we have to take some serius action. \n\nNo more Russian gas, Chines tiktok or cheap products, no matter how tempting. No more voting with the short term gains. \n\nThis may cost A LOT. Like developing African future partners, Mercosur, or maybe India. \n\nThis however must be done if our future should not be so \"gloomy\"",
         "Russia has been waiting for this. They may have not made it to Kyiv in 72 hours, but they have the resources and the manpower to wait. And now the moment has come. \n\nShameful to see what the US has become, from the Cold War days to basically being on the verge of becoming a Russian asset",
         "Well at least we can look forward to bigger paychecks, no crime and all wars ended 'in three days' like this piece of shit promised everyone. Fools.",
         "Congratulations US President Putin, I guess",
         "Russian investment is paying off.",
         "I don\u2019t think people understand the scale of Russia\u2019s mass manipulation of Americans for this election. A majority of these big right wing social media accounts are ran by Russia, this has been going on for years. Years of Russia spreading mass fear through America and converting more and more people to vote red. We\u2019re now seeing the result of this.",
         "If there is any hope for the rest of the world, it's that fascists normally move to consolidate their own domestic power first and punish internal opposition\n\nAmerica will have future elections, but they'll be like the ones we see in places like Hungary where the ruling party controls the apparatus of the whole process and manipulates themselves favourable results whilst putting up the veneer of a token opposition to keep the illusion of choice and freedom alive\n\nThis was a direction of travel since about 2000 when a dumb electorate chose a guy they'd \"rather have a beer with\" over someone who had been at the heart of an otherwise golden period. They could have voted for more of the same and gone from strength to strength, in a world that was opening up, but instead they voted for a moronic Bush \n\nThe bottom line though is that this isn't about Russia interference (and never was). Americans who've been denial since 2016 had better face up to the glaring truth .... this is who you are. \n\nA lot more are very comfortable living under some christiofacist system than America is comfortable about admitting",
         "Not sure if I'm being dramatic, but it feels a bit like the US have finally crossed the Rubicon with this result. Trump in by mandate by winning the electoral college and popular vote, and effectively in control of all branches of Government with a mojority in both houses and control of the Supreme Court. Feels a bit ominous. Particularly if he envisages a system more akin to Russia, with the rebalance and shifting of power to the executive branch and greater influence of oligarchs.",
         "Congrats Putin on the win!\n\nSorry for Europe\n\nRegardless what happens to trump, a republican majority will probably pull back Ukraine funding at the very least. I mean his first impeachment was all about Ukraine, all I can hope now is that's the most damage he could do, but with a conservative majority in the entire federal government I doubt it'll stop there",
         "Russia West. \n\nCongrats you drooling boors - 33 years after winning the Cold War, you've found a way to lose it. \n\nBravo America.",
         "His win is useful to Russians only.",
         "It took 12 years and 85 million lives to remove Hitler from power.",
         "Russia and like-minded behind-the-scenes oligarchs conquered America and they never even had to drop a bomb.\n\nThey just weaponized social media and Americans ate up the lies and spit them out as 'truth'...gleefully.\nThey realized conquering by physical force was not the way, you just simply indoctrinate the minds and you've won.\n\nThe propaganda worked, the billionaire troll farms were effective. They can push through anything they want and sway public opinion, and they have the full compliance of those in power to legitimize it as well now. \nAnd they have the means to make every person dumber and less educated going forward, making it even easier to nudge the majority in whatever direction they want.\n\n\nAmerica is now a very powerful puppet state.\nDemonstrated and proven tonight.",
         "The US has been put on an authoritarian isolationist path. The whole world looks at you with disgust this day. You have maybe doomed Taiwan and Ukraine while weakening Nato, Japan, the EU and Australia. \n\nWhen your enemies cheer and your friends fear, you know you have fallen.",
         "As someone from a third world country, we all aspired to be America. We did not anticipate you joining in the gutters with us.",
         "Russia finally won the Cold War.",
         "Congrats to president Putin and his lackey Frightening Frito. \n\nThe country is gonna implode on itself.",
         "Well, atleast he doesn\u2019t have to use his plane bombs since his buddy is back in charge. \n\nSorry Ukraine. Should have done more when we could.",
         "Great work Republicans, you gave the election to Russia, real smart stuff there",
         "We have failed as Americans. Deeply disturbed by this.",
         "America, you guys are officially an absolute joke. Good job.",
         "Europe will have to step up against Russia because Trump is for the most part a Russian puppet. I predict that he\u2019ll try to force Ukraine into de jure surrendering some territory.",
         "I lost all respect for America today. Like seriously!? You\u2019re electing a convicted felon, rapist dictator",
         "I voted for democracy and now McDonald's can setup on every corner in Moscow. *Elon Musk does a cool jump*",

         "They're not even gonna be subtle about this shit anymore.",
         "America is no longer an ally and the sooner Europe realises this the better",
         "Why are so many people here surprised that Americans did this again? Trump lets them hate openly, that's what they love about him. \n\nJust look through all the comments in the different threads. Not a single Trump voter showing even an ounce of humility. Not even celebrating their own victory. They're all just ecstatic to be able to hurl abuse at the Democrats and LGBTQ community.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>better start seeking shelter you fruity hair colored weirdos\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>No more woke bullshit next year. America is fucking back!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>hahahaha lefties in shambles. just gotta get rid of those woke idiots now.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>YES! Trump will restore the hard working culture and family values I grew up with. Can't wait.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>No more of this gender bullshit finally.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>Europe better get ready to pay for their problems themselves.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>Ooooh I thought Kamala had already won? No? But reddit told me so for weeks. :(\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>Looks like nobody actually voted for that witch.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>Reddit has been full of Dem propaganda for weeks now, but no threads about Trump winning?",
         "Europe needs to prepare for war and understand it\u2019s on its own this time. Tougher positions with Hungary and other Eastern European nations, NATO is going have to reorganise on the assumption the US isn\u2019t going to step in.",
         "Of course it\u2019s useful because Trump will mark the beginning of the collapse of the United States.",
         "Millions of Ukrainians are going to die because of our horrendous decisions tonight.",
         "Goodbye America, you were something for 200+ years. It sucks you threw it all away for a snake oil salesman",
         "Russia won the war without ever firing a shot. Through pure social media influence they've eroded 50 years of work in 15 years.",
         "No kidding! NATO and Ukraine are about to be hobbled like never before. The E.U. Might have to come up with an independent defence pact to negate U.S. dissent.",
         "Russia\u2019s happy with the result, and we all know that Russia only wants good things for the US.",
         "Now they just need to hold the line until Trump pulls the plug. The EU won't be able to pick up the slack and they'll be able to roll the whole country because then it really does just become a war of attrition. Why negotiate for the Donbass when for a few more measly Russian lives you can have the whole lot?\n\nA sad day and a firm blot on Biden's presidency. He *could* have helped them properly, none of this tying of their hands. But he chose not to, for fear of alienating voters, and look what it got him and the Dems. Could say the same about Gaza. They're done now. Lets see what happens with Taiwan.\n\nIt'll probably be the subtitle to his term: 'Could-and should-have done more'.",
         "Yeah.. A Russian puppet is the best Russia could get... RIP Ukraine",
         "Gotta tip your hat to Putin\n\nHe is an asshole but he is a mastermind asshole\n\nHe has totally destabilized his adversary with nothing but a bunch of nerds and a minimal budget",
         "Congratulations to Vladimir Putin for winning the 2024 U.S. election",
         "\"If I'm elected, I'll make sure you never have to vote again\".... America is full of fucking morons.",
         "From the article:  \n\n\n>*Around the time of Trump's victory speech early Tuesday morning, Medvedev posted on Telegram his response to the election night.*\n\n>*Without directly congratulating the*\u00a0[*Republican*](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/republican)\u00a0*candidate, Medvedev referred to how there was a \"furious bipartisan anti-Russian consensus on Capitol Hill.\"*\n\n>*\"But Trump has one quality that is useful for us\u2014as a businessman to the core, he hates spending money on \u2026 idiotic allies, stupid charity projects and voracious international organizations,\" he said, referring to global support for Ukraine.*",
         "Pray for the Ukraine. Don\u2019t want to imagine the fear and hopelessness they now must feel",
         "Of course it will. This outcome will destroy America, that's what most of the east wants. This is the best possible outcome for Russia, China, and North Korea -- a destabilized, weak, and crumbling America. No one to keep them in check anymore, and they will become the top superpowers of the world.",
         "My wife is Ukrainian. She lost her home she grew up in. Her old grandfather was killed at his home by the Russians. She dis not even get to bury him. Now her country is going to be gone. This is very sad",
         "Time for us Europeans to stand up and unite. Stop relying on the uneducated masses across the Atlantic.\n\n\nWhile I loved the US, it is very clear that they can't be relied on with a government that changes every 4 years. So unite and show that Europe always has been on the forefront of civilisation.",
         "A weaker and more polarized selfish USA is all that Putin needs to close his circle on Europe.",
         "I hope all Americans get the proper fascist ass fuck so they realize what they have done. Fucking incredible that this was even a question on who to vote.",
         "Enjoy the russian asset in white house, he already sold you out.",
         "Nobody is even hiding the fact that Trump is licking the balls of Putin. In 2016 it was still a conspiracy",
         "To all of Ukraine: I am sorry. You guys are fucked. The inbred cousin fuckers elected the dictator\u00a0",
         "What a moronic nation you are, truly sad that US have so much influence over the world and that american stupidity and shortsightedness will fuck over not them only.",
         "Goodbye Ukraine, you were all very brave.",
         "The US is the laughing stock of the entire world. They are absolutely pathetic.",
         "This is one time I think Kremlin is speaking truth.",
         "\n\nSadly, I do think this current situation will sour an entire generation of young voters to just stop voting, give up and not care anymore. The system just wasn\u2019t built for them and they got hit with a brutal reality of that. They got their information, did what they had to do, got out there and did their civic duty\u2026and it was for nothing. All they can do is look out for themselves. Their young lives will have that guys fingerprints all over it for the rest of their existence. Hope I\u2019m wrong. \n\nLet\u2019s face it. In the real world, bad guys prevail such a terrible amount of the time.",
         "Disgusting. \n\nI don't care that much if the Americans elect an orange gorilla, but I fear for the Ukrainians and their fate.",
         "Poor Ukraine",

         "Russia has won the cold war.",

         "I don\u2019t usually insult or generalize people on reddit of all places, but fuck. You Americans are fucking stupid.",
         "Of course it is, they'll have indirect control of the USA from January 20th on.",
         "Trump could announce hes been a Russian asset this whole time and his fan base would not change. If anything it would somehow get bigger",
         "Ah yes. Can\u2019t wait for a Russian loving convicted felon to pardon himself of all crimes then in-still himself as a dictator. Project 2025 is here and it\u2019s going to hit the US *hard*. \n\nEveryone tried to warn them, but the people have spoken. We\u2019re all going to look back on this in a few months and say \u2018Not gonna say I told you so!\u2019",

         "When I was a kid, I used to think that the average American was smarter that the rest of Earth's people, you just had to look at their achievements, but yeah, the naivety of youth.",
         "That's it America, you just sided with the guy who kills his critics and blows planes out of the sky for fun.",
         "Russia just wants Americans at odds with each other.  Screw them",

         "Well done USA. The world is laughing at you.",
         "I feel sorry for Ukraine.  This winter just got really cold for them.",
         "I wonder how many Americans will blame Russia for Trump's election instead of accepting the fact that their fellow countrymen are just that stupid.",
         "The US pretty much sold out their democracy to Russia and some greedy Billionaires.",
         "Sigh. Hubris after the end of Cold War 1.0 is the downfall of the US.",
         "Hey republicans- what happens when prices don\u2019t go down? Will you hold trump accountable? Or will you slide back into your \u201cit\u2019s the dems fault somehow\u201d rhetoric?",

         "Slow clap fellow Americans, really good job here.",
         "Putin must be fully erect by this point. After all, he's running America now.",
         "Hopefully this just mean Biden has two months to load Ukraine up to the nose with weapons.",
         "The US will become an oligarchy where billionaires rule the country, just like Russia.",
         "This is what happens when half a country can't point to Europe on a map. Really sucks for the other half that actually lives in the real world. Come on down to Australia if you want, we're not much better but at least we're not riddled with paranoia and guns.",
         "Poland and Estonia are probably shitting their pants...",
         "Everything about this is just absolutely fucking ridiculous. 70 million Americans voting for a rapist and Russian Muppet",
         "I guess at least the libs are owned, amirite guys?",
         "Welcome to United Oblast of America",
         "The Internet Research Agency in Russia has been behind U.S. social media influence to divide Americans to weaken us and promote a candidate that is useful to their international position.

         "Putin can invade Europe as his puppet won't stop him. Fascist world government coming. Hitler would be proud.",
         "Just useful? Ukraine war is over as Trump will end all support. Gaza is going to get a rude awakening on what it\u2019s like when the US President says \u201cDo what you want\u201d and everyone is going to get a reminder of what a bad economy looks like but Trump can blame Biden for the next 10 years so that doesn\u2019t really matter.\n\nMy response to the complaints - it\u2019s what 80% of America voted for.",
         "Watch trump was sanctions as a \u201cgesture of good will\u201d to allow \u201cfruitful negotiations\u201d on ending the Ukraine war. Mark my words.",
         "No shit it's useful. Ukraine is DOA. Europe is squeezed between totalitarian super-powers.",
         "Someone who isnt american, this is both frustrating and mortifying.\u00a0\nPeople voted for a fucking convicted, lying rapist who couldnt even eat and orange with those tiny hands.\n\n\nYet he becomes some inbreds wet fucking dream\u00a0",
         "Ukraine is fucked now. The shitty alternate timeline took over once again.",
         "Of course, but would you expect the brain-rotted Americans to understand this or as to why? \n\nNo. \n\nBecause they supported a rapist. America has always been rooted and filled with scum, how else did we get an abomination like Dump for president and many of those who came before him.",
         "You got to give it to Russia, they know how to win an election!\u00a0",
         "Sorry Ukraine, all of your effort was for naught.  We don't give a fuck about allies anymore, only dictators.",

         "making shit posts to destroy America. All of our fancy technology could not account for the power of the shit post.",
         "The world's biggest mistake was not taking disinformation seriously. It should have been dealt with as an act of war. Kids in schools should have disinfo exercises, there should be just more done to combat this.",

         "The American people now elected a convicted felon president who led an armed revolt against its own democratic institutions. A man who promises to work with the no. 1 enemy of the US of the last 75 years against its own interests.\n\nRussia fucking did it. They won the Cold War. It just took a few more decades for their subversion to take effect.",
         "Turns out America sells out cheap",
         "They just nabbed the #1 podcast host too.",
         "I think the only silver lining of this is that it might jolt Europe awake a little bit. They'll soon have an emboldened Russia even closer to their doorstep after the US pulls Ukrainian support and are going to have to figure out how to counter that alone.\u00a0",
         "Id like to add any social media algoritm is bad for the people. Not just Tiktok. There are so much lies and factually wrong content thrown around carelessly.",
         "In addition to these things, we also need to look at domestic arms and military spending rather than outsourcing to the likes of the US.\n\nNo more F-35's. We need to invest in our own arms capabilities and industries.",
         "10 years late for that. Too many countries happy not to do any effort about it.",
         "UN showed full support for russia last week when Secretary General went to a  BRICS meeting and gave Putin a blowjob. \n\nNow US went the same way, they're not partners anymore, NATO is gone.",
         "> Voters of Europe, no matter right or left, we have to take some serius action.\n\nFirst of all we need to enter the information war that Russia has been waging all by themselves for ages by now. I can't fathom why we aren't fighting back.",

         "Russia hasn't taken Kyiv, but Washington instead.",
         "50 years ago, talking positively about the USSR killed your political career. Nowadays you can openly praise Putin and say Russia is a better country than the US and somehow that gives you more votes. The US has gone from Reagan's \"tear down this wall\" to Trump's \"surrender and give Russia the territories they want\".",
         "Just like that wall Mexico paid for!",
         "I had someone tell me \u201cthe biggest problem with America right now is Immigrants, as soon as Trump gets rid of them, we\u2019re essentially right back to a golden economy and we\u2019ll be making more money!\u201d\n\nI asked why that would affect things. \n\n\u201cUhhh because I saw on Tik Tok that Biden has been giving check to illegal immigrants for over $6000 a month!\u201d\n\nI laughed and walked away",

         "Very well said. Trump is allowed to succeed because white-supremacy, colonialism, misogyny, classism, and the harmful manipulation of religious ideology is a fundamental part of America's cultural DNA. The majority of Americans want those systems to remain intact and dominate society even if doesn't benefit them in the long run. \n\nWe were brainwashed to believe that these systems are acceptable long before Trump.

That's why it has military bases in multiple countries all over the world. If the U.S. can't assist with regional stability, countries will kick the U.S.A out and form their own regional alliances and enter into conflict more often which can lead to a world war or decimation of areas where the U.S. has business interests which will harm our local economy.\n\nNations might also elect to enter into pacts with Russia or China and the U.S. will play a smaller part on the global stage. They will exercise that influence to harm us with tariffs, petroleum prices, etc. NATO might dissolve especially if the U.S. signals its unwillingness to honor its Article 5 commitments as Trump has indicated previously. \"America first\" and isolationism might sound good, but that's where we were 100 years ago when the first two world wars began. The U.S.A. doesn't have the benefit of an established versatile domestic manufacturing base like they did in the 20th century since that has been outsourced to other countries. Where are we going to get the workforce from to rebuild this infrastructure? We already have a low unemployment rate and apparently plan to deport a sizable migrant workforce that will leave jobs in agriculture and construction unfulfilled. Large conflicts will hurt us as our shipping and product lines are disrupted.\n\nA stable Ukraine is in the best interest of the United States.

He tried the Beer Hall Putsch, which was a coup in the early 20s and was such a staggering and incompetent failure because some idiot forgot to cut the phone lines into the rooms where they were holding-hostage the generals and other Germany war nobility. Incidentally, this sort of same staggering incompetence is what *saved* Hitler during the July '44 plot to have him assassinated. People always think the solid oak table is what saved him, and it genuinely did, but people also forget that there was an entire coordinated effort by many in the German Army to make this an an actual operation, including radioing out messages that Hitler was dead and then taking control of certain regiments, detachments and military installations. Well, in this instance, some genius forgot to disconnect the phone line of the room that (I believe it was Goebbels was staying in? Himmler? I can't remember). And they were able to place phone calls and tell people to stop the troop movements because Hitler wasn't dead (so they had found out). This lapse in judgement killed the plot in its tracks because so many of the troop detachments were following a plan put in place in case of Hitler's assassination/death in which so-and-so would assume command after that fact. That screw-up lead to thousands of people tortured to death, with many of these tortures being filmed for Hitler's personal viewing pleasure whenever he felt like it. \n\nWhile the Wehrmacht certainly played an absolutely direct role in the genocide on the Eastern Front and of the Jews, Slavs and Romani; this particular \"episode\" (re: plot) was actually a moral-revolt from within the Germany Army, who felt disgusted and dishonorable at the actions they themselves committed and were being ordered to commit by people higher up in the military high command. We have explicit instructions from people in the Wehrmacht high command giving-the-ok to exterminate the \"Eastern populations\". Incidences of alcoholism and suicide were so high in the SS, and army group populations that took to the slaughter, that this is where Himmler started coming up with ideas on how to efficiently and quickly \"Liquidate\" populations of people (re: gas camps).

         "Ukraine will be in the hands of Putin. Literally all the illegal things Trump did, all the charges he was facing, he has gotten away with all of them. He will split with NATO. Israel will be able to do literally anything it wants. He will staff the government based on who he thinks will be loyal to him, without giving a damn if they\u2019re qualified. Maybe he will put Jared back in charge of the opiate crisis, or maybe he\u2019ll get Hulk Hogan as his press secretary.

This country really, really really hates women. Especially minority women. I really can\u2019t think of any other explanation.

This is almost certainly the nail in the coffin for climate change. Ukraine is fucked. Whatever guardrails the US was trying to impose on Israel are gone.

Well it's because they use the same currency, now I'm no professional economist but do you know back then when Greece was in recession and the whole of Europe was trying to bail Greece out. That's because they used the same currency as the rest of the EU, now Greece was a somewhat minor economy in the EU back then, now what do you think would happen if the largest economy in Europe were to fall into recession? The whole Eurozone would be in crisis as if one country falls into deep recession then all the other countries using the Euros will also be impacted it by it. \n\n\nI hope this is a wakeup call for the UK and the EU and finally start working towards being less dependent on America.",

In Florida, there are 67 counties, so there are 67 Supervisors of Elections. Both mail in and early voting are widespread. In this election cycle, more than 50% of the registered voters in all the local counties voted before election day. Pretty sure Uber and Lyft were offering discounted rides to the polls.The sad part is the number that chose not to vote. Since ID in the US includes both gender and race, it will be interesting to see who stood this one out.",

Those 3 made up the majority to overturn RvW and put women\u2019s healthcare in the hands of the states, most of which do not give a single fuck about the health of their women. Those 3 also made the majority that voted to allow themselves to receive bribes. They also made up the majority that allow any official act by a president to be legal.\n\nHe also proved that impeachment means nothing to his standing as supreme ruler. \n\nSo yeah, he did a lot of fucking harm in 4 years.",
         "There is not. There's just entrenched families of the wealthiest asshats, continuing to be generational asshats. None of it is united, they don't \"control\" anything, they just keep being greedy, stupid, and inhumane, acting together only to kick othe people off the ladder of success and their own family on it. \n\nNobody secretly controls jack; it's just greed and stupidity all the way down; no one is saving anyone from this.",

I think they would and they will use them if it means life or death.  Now that that election has been decided, the trajectory could easily lead to further escalation.",
         "Let's see what happens. Trump has promised he'd stop the war in 24 hours. Hopefully the fact that ruzzia says no means he takes it personally  and gets annoyed and just ends up greenlighting all the Ukraine needs to overwhelm ruzzia all in the search of stopping the war.",
         "War would last just for 2-3 days, they also said back in February 2022.",
         "Their bet was very fat on this guy. And now when they won the bet and have guy in a place that is eager to choke Ukraine to give up lands, Russians will just have a motivation to take as much as possible if this guy is committed to deliver whatever claims they will roll out.

         "Trump isn't even sworn in yet and Russia is backtracking on peace negotiations\n\nIt's as if this has nothing to do with peace and everything to do with stopping aid to Ukraine, if only someone warned us",

         "Thr main issue is Trump and Putin are buddy-buddy. He's a Russian asset and will likely pull some some stunt to hand Ukraine over to Russia or at least a large portion of it.",
         "I see two possible outcomes: Trump halts military aid but facilitates a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia, or he cuts off support, allowing Russia to aggressively advance and likely capture Ukraine within six months. If the U.S. shifts its stance and no longer sees Ukraine as a viable ally, Europe will likely follow suit, pulling their support as well and prioritizing their own defense buildup instead.\n\n  \nSadly in either event I don't see a reality where Zelensky isnt a assassination target at some point in the future.",
         "Will Trump give Ukraine to Russia and start WW3?",
         "But Trump promised?",
         "Russia will now expose and emasculate Trump, for the fool he truly is. China, and Nth Korea will now bolster the war effort in Ukraine, and Trump will have blood on his hands. He is the most dangerous man in modern history due to his foolishness.",

         "Motherfucker, he lied?",
         "Huge Trump opponent here, and with my family in Ukraine I was feeling really down this morning seeing the results.\n\nNow something that is flooding our news channels is that Trump basically offers Putin two options: ceasefire or Ukraine will get all the support from the US to end the war.\n\nI may have been wrong about what he could do for us. I hope he will prove me wrong in January, and my child can finally meet the grandparents.",
         "The other option would be getting some kind of assistance package from South Korea.",

         "Now is the time for Biden to just send in troops to finish the job in the next two months, Desert Storm style!",

         "He needs to answer his boss.",

         "They have a concept of a plan.",
         "Europe has time to mobilize now. They already had plans for Trump\u2019s betrayal. Poland and Ukraine cannot fall to Putin.",
         "Trump said he can stop it in 1 day\u2026 we will give him till Friday!",
         "So, the guy who stole Top Secret documents has been chatting with Putin. Normally that would be a case where FISA courts allow the NSA to listen in on a U.S. national.",
         "Yeah, they have to wait all the way until January to kill the aid to Ukraine and lift the sanctions.",
         "Trump is going to enter the conflict on Putin's side.  The war will end quickly.  If Zelenskyy is smart he will see that sooner rather than later and bargain for the least amount of suffering for his people.  He might have been able to wear down the Russians until they agreed to a cease fire without complete surrender, but Ukraine is not powerful enough to defy the US.\n\nIt's a little bit of a mindfuck, both for us and the rest of the world, to become the baddies nearly overnight, but this is how the chips have fallen.",
         "To all the Ukrainians who had hope- we as a country have failed you.",
         "Wait... you're telling me trump LIED?",
         "Trump had his worst case scenario: he won.\n\nNow he has to be president.",
         "Well. We have a couple of months with Biden on his way out with no worries of reprisal or fanning the flames. Use the time you have left Joe, make the moldy jar of tang hurt.",
         "Yeah i agree, problem like the Russia and Ukraine war are so complicated, and its tough to imagine it all ending overnight. theres a lot of history and tension there, so even with the best intentions, it like take time and a lot of diplomacy to get to a real resolution.",
         "He won't do that. He will however use it as a bargaining chip, of that I'm sure.\n\nAnd honestly, it's needed. Where else is this war going? It's destabilising the entirety of Europe and there's no end in sight. So the best we can hope for is what? That Russia and it's allies gets pushed into a corner where nuclear weapons are the only thing left? No, thank you.\n\nThe war needs to end, and that is what Trump is going for. Everyone involved might not be happy about it, but that's just how it is. There has already been an insane loss of life and no one is going to \"win\" regardless.",
         "We can drill drill drill and drive the price of oil down. This starves the Russian war machine!",
         "Of course it can\u2019t be stopped overnight. Will take some time for UKR to burn through ammunition once the trumpet stops shipments. RIP Ukraine.",

         "Trump invites Russia to NATO, sections are off and they keep the land they took boom peace",
         "I really hope Europe is ready to step up to the plate in a big way. Letting Russia topple Ukraine, China move on Taiwan, and the authoritarian alliance of Russian, China, Iran, and NK gain global influence would have a massive negative impact on the world for the rest of our lives\u2014whether we manage to boot Trump in four years or not.",

         "Honestly, I still don\u2019t understand the point. Does Russia just want Crimea for a vacation spot and access to the ocean? At this point it just seems like a sunk cost fallacy where they\u2019re shooting themselves in the foot while also bleeding out and killing all of the young men by sending them into the meat grinder. Just\u2026 take your loss and back out. You\u2019ll be better off for it.",
         "Alright Trump. Please please open the can of whoop ass onto Russia. They are just begging for it now",
         "They are winning. Why would they?",
         "Clock is ticking. He said within 24 hours of being elected.",
         "Yeah, but now he doesn't need votes. So his promises are as worthless as his businesses.",
         "Are you suggesting that Trump might have lied?!",
         "He can just say he could have, but ukraine amd russia and the rest of the world disagreed, their fault. And his voters will just accelerate licking his asshole",
         "He can still keep it. As long as Putin is willing to pony up.",
         "I have a mixed outlook on this.  Trump is going to do what makes him look best and strong.  While I do think he will end up giving Russia much of what it wants, his ego won\u2019t allow him to be seen as submissive to Russia",
         "Dunno man, as a non-Trump supporter, I kinda agree with him. As a European, Europe needs to put up a LOT more money because geographically we are closer to Russia. Plain and simple Europe are not pulling their weight. Trump did the same with NATO if you compare 2014 with 2024: [https://www.nato.int/nato\\_static\\_fl2014/assets/pdf/2024/6/pdf/240617-def-exp-2024-en.pdf](https://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/2024/6/pdf/240617-def-exp-2024-en.pdf) it's just Trump goes about everything in a weird kinda way, but a lot of the time it's quite effective.",

         "Defense companies will get their way somehow.  Much of the funding is by supply of US made weapons.",
         "Trump lifting the sanctions against Russia will help their economy a lot. Though I don't know how fast companies will be moving back into Russia after the losses they faced last time.",

         "Trump received less votes than he did 4 years ago, where the hell were the Democrats? 15m fewer votes. They allowed this to happen with their apathy. Every moron that refused to vote for Harris for some bs reason wasn't smart enough to realize how much worse Trump would be.",

If we turn them our backs now, then we certainly deserve the same fate in the future.\n\nAs a European living in the Balkan states, I don't feel Russia will necessarily stop at Ukraine. Destabilizing Europe is a net profit for them and they have been and will keep doing it if left unchecked, regardless of this war's outcome. Even if the war ended tomorrow, it's not like things would get better here.\n\nIn addition, it is obvious they are trying to weaken the NATO and the EU. In the long run, if they succeed at dividing us, the next logical step would be conquering us. And if they get their way with nuclear threats once, why wouldn't they repeat them in the future?\n\nGiving up on Ukraine will set a very bad precedent in my opinion. You said the war needs to end. But if Ukrainians are willing to give their lives for their freedom, I think they should do so. I think Russia is betting on us not calling its bluff: they can't keep this war going on forever at this pace.",

         "Europe of course has its own weapons industry, but it is not aligned the way the American one is, where the federal government can just dictate weapons production and direct it to be delivered somewhere specific. The US spent 70 years honing this political structure.\n\nThat means many weapons are produced, but they are sold to buyers in traditional markets, and telling them to produce for Ukraine will mean they have to pause contracts for existing customers and then need absolutely iron clad contracts through long negotiations that they'll be paid for the products they are making, otherwise they will go bankrupt.\n\nAnd no EU governments are geared for that, so the most efficient way is to give money to Ukraine and let them buy off the shelf weapons from EU manufacturers like Rheinmetall.",

         "Article:\n\n>__From January 1, 2025, it will be forbidden to cover the face in public places throughout Switzerland. Violations can be punished with a fine of up to CHF1,000 (about $1,143).__\n\n>On Wednesday, the Swiss government decided to put the new provision to effect from 2025. The controversial \u201canti-burka\u201d initiative was approved by 51.2% of Swiss voters in March 2021.\n\n>The new constitutional article will be implemented in the Federal Act on the Prohibition of Covering the Face. Violations will be dealt with through the administrative fine procedure to minimise bureaucracy. The administrative fine to be paid will be CHF100 and can be paid directly on site. However, those who refused to pay the administrative fine will be subject to the ordinary procedure which carries a maximum penalty of CHF1,000.\u00a0\n\n>The ban on covering the face does not apply on airplanes or in diplomatic and consular premises. The face may also be covered in places of worship and other sacred sites. In addition, covering the face remains is allowed for reasons of health, safety, weather conditions and local Swiss customs. It is also permitted for artistic and entertainment performances and for advertising purposes.\n\n>In exceptional cases, face coverings in public spaces may be allowed if they are necessary for the exercise of freedom of expression and assembly provided that the responsible authority has approved them in advance and public order and security are not compromised.",

It sounds like face covering is fine in a lot of situations, including in private, in places of worship, and when events or themes call for it like conventions or other dress occasions. It also permits face covering depending on weather and season. \n\nIt kinda strikes me as similar to the laws in the US that make it illegal for two adults to go into a voting booth together. It is entirely possible that a wife may feel completely free to vote as she chooses while her husband looks over her shoulder, but regardless it provides her with a safe buffer for why she simply can\u2019t let him join her. \n\nSimilarly, many women who may say \u201cI\u2019m very happy to cover my face or full body\u201d will likely benefit from being able to enjoy some personal bodily freedom while blaming it on the government.",

But I've also seen how my friend was told to feel ashamed if she woke even knee length shorts by her muz boyfriend. How she was slapped for even talking to someone who texted her first. How I've personally seen instances where someone reported of people in the covering doing shenanigans.

It can even be weaponised by a person of different religion to bring bad name to their own community. Think.

It will borderline the absurd as the sheer stupidity that will need to be said to justify things will be off the scale. \n\nPutin needs Trump to direct the US to isolationism, reduce NATO support, reduce Ukraine support but also somehow convince Russian people that the US remains a threat to them in order to continue their pursuits of conflict to create a buffer between Russia and NATO, whilst at the same time not pissing off Kim who he needs to also convince that the US remains a threat to them in order to keep the munitions flowing. \n\nKim needs to somehow be friendly with the US so that their ties with South Korea wane and they won\u2019t back the South Koreans as much but remain strongly against the US and NATO in order to placate their growing relationship with Russia in case the Ukraine war continues. We don\u2019t even know whether he likes Trump or not after their bromance kinda fizzled out and he is now in a position where he has to make a choice to satisfy his own relationship with Putin of remaining anti-US or sacrifice that so that he can achieve his own ambitions of venturing south as the US loosens its ties with the South Koreans. \n\nTrump will now likely think to placate Putin at the expense of all other current US allies which then leaves them in a position of possible weakness, reduced military base options and reach, reduced trade income (which he hopes to make up through tariffs) but then also somehow convince the rest of NATO that his placating of Putin means that they should not fully rearm to defend themselves against Putin and Kim when the US is removing their stance of protection. The Europeans aren\u2019t just going to sit back and watch so he has to make a choice on which side be butters his bread. I suspect common sense from his staffers will lean towards NATO. As for Kim, if he looks to reignite the friendship, Putin may have some major questions about that relationship if the US remains in NATO. \n\nOf this group, Xi is the only one who even remotely looks like they may be reasonable and have any form of foreign policy competence and that is saying something. In a meeting of the minds, Xi comes across as the most reasonable which means that we have gone wrong somewhere as a species. \n\nOn top of it all, Trump isn\u2019t anti-NATO. He wants proper spending from all nations and he wants the Europeans to buy arms which he openly admits. If he wants to satisfy his economic mandates, rearming Europe is easily the most fruitful way to do this with military contracts. \n\nHis economic policies come in direct contradiction to foreign policy if isolationism is the choice. It\u2019s almost impossible to navigate these paths for even the most competent politicians. \n\nI sure hope Americans are strapped in as I suspect a lot of bumbling madness is about to ensue and the first few years will be about enforcing some of the backwards things in stateside domestic policy rather than changing the status quo in foreign and military policy.",

Trump can ghost or betray Putin just like he's done to every other friend he's had, and there's hardly a pro-Russia consensus among the Republican Party either (about half and half I think). I don't think the piss tape is real, and even if it was would Trump even care? Blackmail might just piss him off at this point. Bribe? The entire world would be watching those finances, plus Trump can either take the money and run or just ignore it. MJT or JDV telling him to do it? Marjorie's a nobody and he hates JD, and half the GOP is still telling him to send those guns over. He can't even pull out of NATO given congressional laws.\n\nThe war is lucrative for the US military-industrial complex, and that kind of institutional power is really hard even for the president to stop if Congress wants the aid to continue. Last aid package to Israel was tied directly to Ukraine aid, and that's unlikely to change if half of Republicans and virtually all Democrats in each house decides to leave it that way. Mike Johnson did plenty of obstruction and bought Putin half a year, but apparently that wasn't enough in the long run.\n\nIn practice, aid to Israel likely dries up when aid to Ukraine does. That's all it would take to keep things on life support. I reckon Trump doesn't care about either Putin or Ukraine enough to change this too much, and the conflict Israel is waging puts immense political pressure on his administration to keep the status quo. He burns bridges with his other friends too that way (Netanyahu and his own family even with the Kushners), plus it's become clear his political stance is only as deep as the last friendly face he's talked to that day.",

         "Well Russia invaded Ukraine twice under the Democrats. Just like other despots, they don't care about diplomacy and know it will be all talk under the Democrats.\n\nSame reason why Israel has been at war at the same time both times. Terrorist groups get to run amok under the Democrats, even ISIS made a comeback under Biden after rising under Obama.",

         "I\u2019ve never gotten the implication that predators would be more likely to attack you in a bathroom if they were gender neutral. \n\nLike, are you saying that a percentage of men are rapists if given the opportunity or that the invisible barrier at the front of the women\u2019s room was impenetrable to rapists before the trans people started passing through it?",

Then it periodically had complained that the European allies weren\u2019t spending enough on defense and weren\u2019t supporting enough of the other things the United States wanted to do. Well, it\u2019s always great to call the shots and get other countries to pay the costs. That\u2019s not a realistic approach, and so it\u2019s no surprise that we are where we are now.\n\nNow as before, when the US says \"spend more on military\" they mean \"pay more into the US military industrial complex\" without having any say on what is being done with it. The US has even in recent times not appreciated EU military budgets going up as they do not get spend in the US entirely. What they want is to force us to pay, mafia style \"protection money\", not defense partnership level.\n\nEurope will wake up or sleep forever.",

Stop seeing race and gender. Start seeing Americans. \n\nWe are all just AMERICANS in this vote and decision and that\u2019s how I prefer it.",

We know all races voted, but it was enough who were opposed for that reason.  And listen to Trump racist dog whistles that got him in. And I'm tired of the cliche, I know black people, some of my best friends are black.

I am afraid that in order to focus on the China issue, he will actually condone North Korea's nuclear weapons and treat it like a country like Pakistan.",
         "well yeah, Trump is going to basically sell them out to China.  What do you expect?",

         "Another way of phrasing the headline would be the dollar strengthens after Trump wins presidential election.",
         "Let's face it, Trump didn't win because he's Trump. He won because the Democratic Party chose a candidate who the public views as incompetent. She had 4 years to prove herself while Biden's health was declining. Now here we are.",

Korean right-wingers tend to be more pro-US but are also more open to developing an independent nuclear arsenal.

They had some of the most extensive trilateral negotiations between NK-SK-US they've had since the war and Trump met with Kim in person at the DMZ and all that jazz... But the negotiations broke down because Trump's team insisted on NK denuclearizing in exchange for normalized relations and lifting of sanctions and they wouldn't budge on that issue, so the talks ended up going nowhere.",

If one is willing to take the economic damage, increased competition for US business, less stability for the US in the world order due to ripping up long lasting US security than that is a fair position to take! just dont pretend its only benefits Korea, its a two way street.",
         "The only way America is \"propping up\" South Korea is by stationing about 20k troops acting as a tripwire and trading. There's over 20 times more South Korean soldiers defending the country than US soldiers. The US does not give SK money like it does to Israel or Egypt and has impeded South Korean nuclear development in the past.\n\nEDIT: Also, Korean companies are actually among the largest investors in the US economy.

Forty years ago in a top-secret project, the US military set about finding out. Oliver Burkeman talks to the men who solved the nuclear puzzle in just 30 months\u2026\n\n>Finally, after a valedictory presentation at Livermore attended by a grumpy Edward Teller, they were pulled aside by a senior researcher, Jim Frank. \u201cJim said, \u2018I bet you guys want to know how it turned out,\u2019\u201d Dobson recalls. \u201cWe said yes. And he told us that if it had been constructed, it would have made a pretty impressive bang.\u201d How impressive, they wanted to know. \u201cOn the same order of magnitude as Hiroshima,\u201d Frank replied.\n\n>\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a depressing thing to know, that it could be that easy,\u201d Dobson says. \u201cOn the other hand, it\u2019s far better to know the truth.\u201d And the truth today, he is certain, is that terrorists - with a bit of luck and, crucially, access to the right materials - could easily build a nuclear bomb. \u201cBack in the 50s, there were two schools of thought - that the ideas could be kept secret, and that the material could be locked up. Now? Well, hopefully the materials can still be locked up, but we all have our doubts about that.\u201d Obtaining sufficiently enriched fissile material could be difficult but, when it comes to creating the bomb, \u201cIt turns out it\u2019s not overwhelmingly difficult. There are some subtleties that are not trivial ... but an awful lot has been published.

Not to mention that China is much more self serving with there predatory loans given with no transparency, China even go after its own diaspora for being against the regime.\n\nThat deal happened in the name of nuclear non-proliferation, something we all should support simply because of the number of times technical difficulties almost caused nuclear war.\n\nI agree but it\u2019s also bad policy to abandon allies in the name of moral and ethical superiority."

Whatever Europe does on defense, she said, should not take away from the role of NATO and U.S. leadership of NATO.\n\nThe United States wanted to dominate European security. Then it periodically had complained that the European allies weren\u2019t spending enough on defense and weren\u2019t supporting enough of the other things the United States wanted to do.

The West failed when they allowed Russia to become bold enough to believe they could act this way, and so they did. That all started in 2014, largely due to reliance on Russia as a trading partner which was a mistake.\n\nA deal to end the conflict is unlikely to make either side happy and will result in some kind of DMZ.

The US pulling out will effectively half the amount of military aid going to Ukraine.\n\nEurope will continue to support Ukraine, as it has from the beginning. \n\nUkraine's success does not _solely_ depend on the US.

That's why I said in hindsight. \n\nPutin played Biden perfectly, knowing he wouldn't cross a certain line. It was a gamble, and if paid off tremendously. Now Ukraine is potentionally fucked over it.",

None of that shit is coming back and even if it were the cost to do business by having to pay American workers will raise prices in and of itself.\n\n\nTariffs, when not highly specific and targeted, are terrible tools for the country using them. So correct there. Problem is the rhetoric isn't talking about using any tariffs for highly specific and targeted areas.",

He is in a very different Situation as putin therefore He is going a different way.\n\nWhen he says stuff Like that he puts himself in putins Shoes. But in his own shoes obviuosly a different strategy is going to be his move. \n\nReally Most hate Towarts trump comes from people misunderstanding him.",

Judging by the docs they've since found in Lebanon and the west bank they were right to be worried about that, but completely failed israelis when it came to defending against hamas in gaza. They even saw iranian trained and armed militants rehearsing the attack, but when fed up the chain of command, all they got back was, \"hamas knows they're not capable of pulling off a victorious assault like that and won't try it.\"\n\nEdit: in contrast, israel has been preparing for an eventual war with hezbollah since shortly after 2004.

I did not catch that GP said \"Palestinian\" not just Gaza.  \n  \nAnd yes, The Lancet estimated 180K deaths back in July...it must be well over 200K by now.  \n  \n> In recent conflicts, such indirect deaths range from three to 15 times the number of direct deaths. Applying a conservative estimate of four indirect deaths per one direct death to the 37\u2009396 deaths reported, it is not implausible to estimate that up to 186\u2009000 or even more deaths could be attributable to the current conflict in Gaza. Using the 2022 Gaza Strip population estimate of 2\u2009375\u2009259, this would translate to 7\u00b79% of the total population in the Gaza Strip. A report from Feb 7, 2024, at the time when the direct death toll was 28\u2009000, estimated that without a ceasefire there would be between 58\u2009260 deaths (without an epidemic or escalation) and 85\u2009750 deaths (if both occurred) by Aug 6, 2024.  \n  \nAnd...it is also important to note that not all of these deaths have actually occurred at this point.  The current war has health impacts that will continue to kill people for years after the actual conflict ends.  I haven't seen any estimates recently, but I'd guess 70-80% of all structures have been destroyed.  All infrastructure has also likely been destroyed.  There are probably thousands of bodies buried in the rubble.  People we don't even know are dead yet and that aren't counted in the 45K.

They have been convinced that the 'liberal' media just targeted Trump and blew his incompetence and destructiveness out of proportion, because they chose to ignore it and don't know any of the details for themselves.\n\nTrump's actions as president were *significantly worse* than most people know or are willing to believe - just his actions regarding Ukraine are completely horrifying and disqualifying for anyone who paid any attention at all, but evidently almost nobody did. This time he will not be constrained by any of the dozens of old-guard Republicans who told him 'no' last time. 'Why can't we nuke a hurricane to blow it off course?' Could easily, and seriously, turn into, 'Why can't we just nuke Kyiv to end the war?' More likely, he'll just cooperate with Russia openly and give Putin whatever he wants. There will be nobody to stop this demented fucker from making decisions just that insane and self-serving on a daily basis. Anyone willing to stand on principle or draw a line of any sort will be purged from the administration.\n\nHundreds of Billions were spent targeting young people this election cycle, spreading vile regressive propaganda and attacks on liberal ideals to the younger generation who aren't already captured by Fox News or talk radio. I believe the battle (and perhaps the war) was won in convincing most of that generation not to vote. I firmly believe the Elon Musk purchase of twitter with his and foreign billions and the Rogansphere extreme right podcast/streamer contingent is what made Trump a viable candidate after all he's said and done. It must be acknowledged that there is a baked-in evangelical religious devotion to the Republican party which is decades in the making, with decades of life remaining, and I'd argue that accounts for *most* GOP votes, but I think driving apathy in the face of open rising theocratic fascism among the younger generations as a whole is what won this election, and it's incontrovertible proof to me that humans (and certainly Americans) aren't equipped to deal with the 'information' age.\n\nIt seems that Trump did not lose an appreciable number of voters from 2020, which is nothing less than an indictment on the American people. His horrific management of the pandemic and all that entailed may have hurt him in 2020, but it was evidently forgotten. His months-long, multi-state, many-lawyered attempted coup which culminated in him sending a mob to stop Mike Pence from certifying the election did not lose him voters. His generals saying he's a danger to the country and a fascist, he himself saying he'd be a dictator on day 1 who would jail (at best) his political enemies did not matter. His 34 felony convictions, his absconding with top secret defense documents, hiding them in his unsecure bathrooms, and attempting to destroy the video evidence of his henchmen hiding them from the FBI did not matter, none of it made any difference at all.\n\nThis is not a messaging problem, it is a propaganda problem, and it is a reasoning problem. The American people did not reason themselves into electing Trump a second time and I don't see how we reason our way out of the Supreme-Court-legalized autocracy that we just voted for.",

Personally i don't think they would want to even acknowledge that its happened because it would show a kink in their nuclear armour as such i think if this happened anciently they would downplay it or just ignore it. \n\nIF however Ukraine was to start a deliberate campaign of trying to target Russian nuclear weapons in a move to either disable or weaken the Russian Nuclear deterrent then that would be a nuclear provocation and could be a callus beli for a nuclear response.

These categories are not directly comparable to the former PMAK. Crimes with fatalities, recorded within KPMD-PMK as religiously motivated, have so far exclusively originated from Islamist ideology. No such crimes from Christian motivations have been reported in KPMD-PMK to date.\n\n>In the period from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2016, 16 fatalities from homicides in the category PMAK were statistically recorded by the Federal Criminal Police Office. Since January 1, 2017, 3 fatalities from homicides in the category PMK-religious ideology have been recorded by the Federal Criminal Police Office.\n\n>Since January 1, 2017, 1 fatality from a homicide in the category PMK-foreign ideology has been recorded by the Federal Criminal Police Office.\n\n>These figures are provisional and subject to change due to updates and amendments.\n\n>Best regards,\n\nThat's 18 victims from right wing violence and 19  from foreign crime.",

They should have learned from how the last government was toppled.

         "I am not sure equating homosexuality to pedophilia works here. A lot of Muslim nations are fine with 12 year old brides and younger. I think it is just hate of what is different rather than a sin. You can't say Islam is against pedophilia when the main figure head was a pedophile.",

You nailed it on the head.\n\nAlthough to be fair, most Muslims living in the west want their daughters to go to school and be educated and live good lives etc, but at the end of the day in their world view god created an order to things (man + women = family. Man is the breadwinner, women is the homemaker etc.), and there is a fundamental thing that Kamala represents goes against that order - homosexuality.\n\nI think the root of it is that Muslims, naturally, want to raise their kids to be Muslim and follow what they believe to be the order that god created, and they are afraid that pro-LGBTQ stuff in school will threaten that.\n\nEDIT - think of it this way, like most other religions views, the soul and the afterlife is what really matters. It doesn't matter how shitty this life is, as long as your soul goes to heaven. In their view, racism doesn't risk the souls of their children, but homosexuality does.",
         "You\u2019re just reminding us that this community is stupid considering Trump was trying to do weird racist immigration bans on them. \n\nHe has more power now than before. Guess they got what they wanted.",
         "Equating the view of it - a better way to word it would have been most Muslims view homosexuality the same way most westerners view pedophilia. You make a fair criticism, but I don't know anyone from my community who would be okay with an adult having sexual relations with a child. There's probably sexual predators in my community like any other community, but I haven't heard anyone say pedophilia is okay, but I have heard plenty of them say homosexuality/Transsexuality shouldn't be allowed.\n\nAgain, its hard to understand if you haven't been brought up with it, but the prophet is the exception, not the norm, Anything the prophet does is considered to be sanctioned by god, and doesn't apply to the general Muslim population.",
         "I mean Trump never did that he banned people from 7 Muslim countries that don't even represent half the world's Muslims from entering, for 6 months. Muslims can also be anti-immigration.",
         "Ofcourse. Not knowing your community allows only to be generalized which sucks. I hope most communities are against hurting kids. But sadly even religions that are against it have predators. \n\nFully understand though the way people view things. It is similar in how I grew up in christian views (though there are plenty of Christians that are fine with LGBTQ people, hopefully there are also Muslim sects that are tolerate it and allow LGBT and women in their leadership). I had to learn to not think everything that a religion says is a sin is actually a sin.",
         "Anyone who support Sharia law should be considered as someone supporting pedophilia.\n\nIt's easy, just ask Muslims to recognize the prophet marrying a kid and consuming the marriage at such a young age isn't okay. If they think it's okay, it's literally defending pedophilia."

This section ensures that incriminating evidence provided to a parliamentary committee may not be used directly in subsequent criminal proceedings except in a prosecution for perjury or for the giving of contradictory evidence. However, it is important to point out that in spite of the legal protections available to witnesses, the possibility exists that as a result of media coverage of the committee proceedings the possibility of a fair hearing in court could still be compromised. For example, while a committee's minutes would not be admissible at a criminal trial, the testimony could assist a police investigation or direct a Crown prosecutor to a line of questioning useful for his or her purposes which otherwise might have been unavailable for the purpose of prosecuting the offence. Again, in such circumstances, the committee may wish to consider holding\u00a0in camera\u00a0proceedings.\n\n[Source](http://www.revparl.ca/english/issue.asp?art=1030&param=152)\n\nSo, a witness at a parliamentary committee must answer the questions, but what is said can not be used as evidence in a criminal trial.",

It's as if reality holds no grounds anymore. Go visit Iran (as many YouTubers have) and then make YOUR OWN decision about their culture, lifestyle and/or how oppresive it is. \n\nIn regards to women and being safe. The more Islamic a country's government is and the more they prescribe the \"headscarf\" (the thing Mother Mary wore), the less rape and sexual assault occurs in the country, because, the sole reasons of the headscarf  is that it is mandated by God and that it is to protect a women's chastity \u2014 we know how women get treated when they show their bodies off and objectify themselves. \n\nA woman is more likely to get assaulted in England, France, Namibia, The U.S, Sweeden or Botswana than she is in Iran, Saudi Arabia, or Afghanistan (the only countries that have MANDATED the headscarf). Out of the top 50 countries with the highest rates of rape only 4 are \"headscarf wearing ones\" (Pakistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Turkey). In other words, a woman is safer in a headscarf wearing country than in a non headscarf wearing one.\n\nThe reason a woman might feel \"oppressed\" is because she wants to show her self off, or doesn't believe in what God has mandated, it's simple. Now, should women be allowed to dress in booty shorts if she desired, or be legally forced to cover herself up in public is the debate to have.

This piece of news at Radio Farda's website also states that after the attacks' news was released, some Iranian citizens gathered in front of the Embassy of Switzerland in Tehran, which serves as the protecting power of the United States in Iran, to express their sympathy and some of them lit candles as a symbol of mourning.",

Though I will say I did feel for a long time that post 9/11 us-iranian relations were super mishandled by the us (as well as of course iran), but all bush really said was no thank you to iranian help in Iraq, and the Iranians took that as a slight to their national honor and prestige.

Seeing how they stoke the flames of war and hate in the region more and more since the us has been withdrawing it's presence in the region, and especially since 10/7, leads me to believe Iran just has an easier time lying to appear like the rational actor... or rational to them just means something entirely different to the us.",

This OSAT is the sanctioned party in this case. When the GF salesperson (or account exec, etc) attempted to validate that the OSAT was valid, the trade compliance software approved the transfer so it went through. It wasn\u2019t until a later audit where they found that the information for this particular OSAT was misentered into the system so when it should\u2019ve been blocked, it wasn\u2019t. At that point is when GF notified the regulators and agreed to pay the fine. \n\nThey don\u2019t say what the product was that was shipped, but GF isn\u2019t competing with the TSMCs of the world at the cutting edge nodes, so I think it\u2019s pretty unlikely that anything of extraordinary value was provided to the Chinese government.

No, it would be almost impossible for new hires to know and for other departments, the probability would be very low.\n\nOn top of that, employees might fear that if they report something, it might end up with the corporate death penalty, which means if they report it, it could end up in them losing their jobs. We already have to have laws on the books for whistleblowing already, where if the whistleblower receives reprisals, they can sue the company for those reprisals.

But stealth shape is terrible for aerodynamics, and especially aircraft stability and control. That\u2019s where the software comes in, to compensate for the aerodynamic instability of the aircraft. In addition to all the weapon and countermeasure systems.",
         "Not just that. Those high tech avionics are needed because these planes often trade better flight performance for a little extra stealth. It\u2019s hard to make control surfaces for a stealthy fighter, for instance, without compromising the stealth. They have to make a lot of unconventional choices for their control surfaces as a result, which makes flying the plane without some kind of computer assisted control really difficult, basically impossible really. Plus, it gives a significant advantage to our pilots by allowing them to focus on other tasks by freeing up some of the attention needed to maneuver the plane. \n\nThe reality is that Russia is way way behind us in terms of knowledge on how to build planes with minimal RCS. They try to compromise for this a bit by building a larger aircraft that can accommodate more powerful radars so the Su-57 can, in theory at least, detect a threat long before it gets close enough to target the Su-57. However, against a proper stealth fighter like an F-22 or F-35, those aircraft would still probably get target lock and take down an Su-57 before they even knew what hit them, because it\u2019s basically invisible on radar, especially next to a monster like the Su-57 that sticks out on radar like a sore thumb. These planes are actually stealthy enough to sneak through radar contested airspace with relative ease, something the Su-57 could never do.",

The SU-57 is even directionally unstable, in addition to being longitudinally unstable and, by all accounts, appears to have excellent control characteristics. \n\nIt's very much the stealth aspect of it, i.e. the materials, the build quality, the ability to shape the aircraft, ect.",

         "Their stealth plane the J-20 is better",
         "That\u2019s a small reason really. I think their main reasoning actually has more to do with the engine designs they have available, which is also a area where they are pretty far behind. They are catching up with their fighter jet engines slowly, even if their stealth tech still sucks. \n\nI think they were able to reach their goal with the engines of the Su-57 performance wise, but that\u2019s about as small as they could make them. And, as it stands, they are way bigger than the f-22s engines and require a lot more fuel. They still have an impressive thrust to weight ratio, but the fact it is bigger means you still have to carry more fuel and make the plane itself bigger to make room for all that. These things mean the stealth aspects of the design have to be that much better to adequately conceal the airframe from enemy radar. \n\nSo basically, as a stealth fighter, the Su-57 is a joke compared to the F-22 or F-35. But in a more general sense, like if we\u2019re talking air superiority or multirole aircraft roles, the superior stealth capabilities of these planes goes a long, long way. Even if the Su-57 is comparable in some physical performance respects, in many others, it has glaring weaknesses our planes either lack or have more advanced counter measures for \u2014 the fact that they are almost impossible to find, either from the air or from the ground, being the first line of defense.",

The computing power of the USSR in the 80s was comparable to the US in the 60s and had barely grown since the late 60s. By the end of the 80s the soviet computer industry was only starting seeing implementation of integrated circuit and transistors. There was a reason that the soviet computer industry basically disappeared as soon as the iron curtain fell as it could not compete with the international standards and was absolutely tiny compare everyone else.\n\nOn the other hand the only reason that the US started using the Pyotr's paper was because there was already a push to design a low radar return aircraft and the method to do so was really expensive requiring a mockup to be built and stood up in front of a radar array every time changes were made. But it turns out having massive computing power and wide spread consumer base using said computing power means there was easy access to calculate the necessary equations to produce a stealth aircraft using Pyotr's paper.\n\nThat's not to mention that the soviet aircraft industry was basically running of fumes since the MiG-25. Famously the western air forces was terrified of it due to its appearance and advertised specifications. The US designed the F-15 in response to it capable of matching everything the MiG-25 was advertised to do. Yet when the US got their hands on one it turned out to be huge nothing burger as the plane can do all the things it was advertised to do only to shake itself apart or melt its engines doing it.",

As such, the no escape zone is only in the first X miles after launch, and definitely won't be relevant after the missile has already flown 100+ miles.\n\nAs such, any targets at those ranges would have plenty of time to defeat those missiles.\n\nMissiles with dual stage boosters like the R-77M can definitely change things, but the AIM-120D doesn't have dual stage boosters; nor does it have a ramjet engine like the meteor.

They occasionally even got a little ahead in some places. Naturally, it\u2019s much easier to follow rather than lead in technology. \n\nThe USSR would have got stealth jets \u201cby hook or by crook.\u201d They would have been 10 or so years behind the US, but still way before Russia and China in our timeline.",

         "Well, it goes even further than that actually. The design of military aircraft is complex as hell, to say the least. Literally the smallest, most inconspicuous little differences amount to massively different outcomes. Every single characteristic of the plane is part of at least one design trade off of some kind. \n\nAnother priority for the Russians with the Su-57 was that it have larger weapons bays and better range than the F-22. It is also intended for a slightly different set of roles, being intended for more multirole support \u2014 especially for supporting Russia\u2019s large army forces on the ground, rather than focusing as much on air to air combat and extreme stealth/evasion capabilities. This also fits into Russia\u2019s overall doctrine where most of their aircraft are intended to be deployed over Russian controlled or friendly, radar protected airspace. Unlike the f-22, which pretty much goes where ever the fuck it wants \u2014 so long as it has the range.  Also, as an aside, it is also easier to fit and design different weapons for a larger weapon bay than a smaller one, which may be a small advantage, but that is highly dependent on mission, the actual loadouts and weapons selected, etc.\n\nIn short, Russia\u2019s strategy with these planes is to get a (small) step closer to our stealth capabilities while also producing a new fighter to replace some of their aging fleets that is sufficiently modernized to fit into their current overall strategic plans for countering NATO\u2019s power. They know their stealth tech isn\u2019t there yet, as well as other areas they run behind in, so instead they made a larger plane that can fly further and carry more weapons, which in theory may help them even the odds in a potential conflict with nato aircraft, prioritizing those features to make it work better with the rest of the Russia military and its doctrine. It doesn\u2019t try to compete with the advanced stealth or other tech we have. It\u2019s a bit of a brutish approach to airpower really, very Russian if I\u2019m being honest.",

The Raptor being the winner of the ATF(advanced tactical fighter) program to replace the F-15 in the air superiority role.\n\nThe Su-57 didn't hit the drawing board until 2001 after the failure of the MiG 1.44 program, and the conceptual...failure-ish of the Su-47. The MiG 1.44/1.42 program MFI (multifunctional frontline fighter *English translation*)was the proceeding Soviet and then now Russian answer to the US atf program.",
         "Based on quick Wikipedia reads both planes were initiated in the 80s as the 'replacement plane' to the current top of the line but the programme that became the SU-57 was delayed by 9 years from 91-2000 because of a, thing, and it's been plagued by funding issues/corruption/brain drain ever since\n\nWe do need to be cautious about calling it a pile of dog crap though, this is a clear tech transfer to China and the Chinese maybe able to take an idea or two to improve on the J35 or figure out if they can mass produce the su-57 with improvements for localized air dominance in Europe. The cumulative sum of the current SU-57 makes it a laggard in the 5th gen space but they aren't on serialized production really and if incremental improvements can be made with this tech transfer it can move the needle on what their adversaries need to consider when countering it or the J series fighters",
         "The Mig-25 was hyped by Western intelligence, not by the Soviets.",
         "Look man, when a guy who worked in air defence says the 57's cross section is abysmal, I believe it. I also believe when he says the us has to put radar reflectors on their 22's and 35's to make them visible for peacetime operations.\n\nRussia has a history of massively overpromising what their planes can do and woefully underdelivering. I doubt the plane would even compete against the jets that are supposed to be its peers.",
         ">the AIM-174 is still a prototype. [...] to my knowledge, no F/A-18 Super Hornets has ever fired one\n\nThis is highly misleading.\n\nThe Navy has already [acknowledged](https://www.navalnews.com/naval-news/2024/07/u-s-navy-confirms-sm-6-air-launched-configuration-is-operationally-deployed/) the AIM-174b is operationally deployed at present.\n\nObviously the notion of F-15EXs carrying the AIM-174b is purely speculative. This should be self-evident enough that you shouldn't feel the need to paint the missile as some pie-in-the-sky prototype of unproven worth.",

The J20 used to run AL-31s for a decade until China was able to make a more powerful and reliable variant of the WS-10 but it still only has a TBO of about 1500 hours and slow thrust response. Compare that to a P&W-135 of 3000-6000 hours until TBO. I will be thoroughly impressed if China has been able to overcome all of their manufacturing and quality issues and in one step make an engine that is far superior in every metric of the WS-10 and is on par with the reliability of US engines.",
         "You are basing your assumption on the early cold war. As the cold war went on soviet tech fell further and further behind. Only by brute force and careful propaganda did the USSR appear to have comparable technology by the middle of the cold war. And in the later stages of it USSR had basically bankrupted itself trying to keep up with anything. What little lead the USSR had at any stage is done for propaganda victories and not for the advancement of technology. They got the first satellite into space only because their actual first satellite they are planning was going to fail to complete manufacturing never mind launching before when the US was planning to launch their first. Thats why all sputnik did was beep. Compare to the explorer 1 which had an array of scientific instruments onboard for measuring radiation, atmosphere, temperature and even micro meteors. They had the first women in space only because the US was starting training an entire group of women to send to space. etc. Even what technology they did manage to steal is often half the necessary information. Famously they stole the plans for the uranium enrichment but not the radiation reports on the leftover materials. The russians even today are still operating liquid fuel ICBMs even on submarines because they never was able to obtain the technological know how and the expertise to manufacture long lasting solid fuel. Something the US mastered in the 60s with the minuteman series. The only thing that the soviet really kept up with the US was assassinations and regime changes.",

         "As a American, it\u2019s still my favorite plane from a foe, and probably the best plane the Russians produced. It was purely designed to take down the SR-71, and though it would have likely failed in its mission if it was finished in time, it\u2019s still a fascinating piece of Soviet Cold War technology.",
         ">This is nonstandard, highly misleading use of the word 'prototype.'\n\nThe only photos of Super Hornets carrying that missile are inert stand-ins, hence why I said \"prototype\".\n\nThe main point is that the F-15EX probably isn't able to carry and fire the missile.",
         "Not to mention, while the SR-71 only ever had a handful of airframes and was operated by one country, the AIM-120D is being used by multiple countries and there are thousands (?) of them. With so many operators and wide usage, if it has much more range than publicly stated, I expect to see it leaked in the Warthunder forums by now.",
         "Correct. So this capability probably doesn't exist right now.",
         "Well, that's pretty different from the initial claim of F-35 guiding missiles from F-15EX at targets hundreds of miles away, isn't it?\n\n>Can the Russians field enough su-57s for this to even matter?\n\nProbably not, but that's not what we're discussing.",

         "American companies aren\u2019t immune to not understanding the design and manufacturing processes of other countries. \n\nLook at the Toyota system. Lots of American companies wholesale copied it, and it ended up with cascading production issues when supply chains were disrupted. Toyota understood their systems and knew where they were weak, and built stockpiles in critical goods.\n\nWhen you just copy something without understanding how and why it was designed you\u2019re going to have adverse effects.",
         ">The only photos of Super Hornets carrying that missile are inert stand-ins, hence why I said \"prototype\".\n\nYep - but, again, I think there are relevant facts *beyond* the two you presented, which are useful as everyone draws their own conjectures / conclusions:\n\nYes: (1) the photos of the AIM-174b have only shown us inert stand-ins, and (2) the missile has not been publicly acknowledged to have been fired from an F/A-18.\n\nBut also: (3) the U.S. Navy has confirmed that it is operationally deployed in its air-launched configuration, and (4) the missile itself has already been used [*in combat*](https://www.twz.com/sea/navys-sm-6-missile-used-in-combat-report) in its booster-motivated configuration.\n\nIn fact, I'd caveat (1): the \"CATM\" designation [we last saw](https://theaviationist.com/2024/09/11/f-a-18f-heavy-air-to-air-load-aim-174s/) taxonomically distinguishes it from Y-prefixed prototypes and X-prefixed experimental deployments. The C prefix means it's the captive (training dummy) version of a production missile.\n\n>The main point is that the F-15EX probably isn't able to carry and fire the missile.\n\nAgreed, although we must admit this is speculative. There would certainly be a lot of software work to integrate the SM-6 into the F-15's datalink / guidance systems, which are obviously different from the Navy's Super Hornets, but (to my admittedly thin knowledge on all this) I don't know that there's an outright incompatibility that would make this impossible.",
         "I definitely understand that, but the US has a habit of saving the best for ourselves. I would be highly surprised if we didn't have air to air capability touching on 200+ miles, we definitely do for certain platforms and applications (JASM-ER for example).\n\nPlus we already know the infosec issues with war thunder forums, and while most of the breaches on there were for classified info, they weren't really all too consequential of breaches IIRC. \n\nWe're talking air-to-air missiles, something I'm sure are a highly guarded secret, where only a select group of people know the true range (maybe not even the pilots themselves). It's simple to code in switches in tech to make sure the full features are walled off until someone gives the go-ahead. \n\nHowever, you're absolutely right on your original point. Focusing on publicly available knowledge is best, since it's all just idle speculation. I'll defer to you on this.",
         "Didn't claim it did. Just that our Eurocanard flying friends have enviable range with their neat-o cool guy throttling missiles. \n\nAlso, don't forget the AIM-260. According to Wikipedia, it's on schedule and expecting a \"some time in 2024\" production with a published range of 120 miles. It's F-35 compatible. \n\nWe also have the AIM-174B, fired from Super Hornets, with a published range of \"*at least* 130 miles.\"\n\nI'd say between these, we're doing just great against the Su-57.",
         "What jet gives the aim 174b a ride is irrelevant.  It's the capabilities of the missile and the f35 that make this possible. You're hung up on the least important detail",
         "Nah, they call it,  \u201cwe straight up stole the f35 designs\u201d35",
         "The drone market would like a word",
         "I am just saying that this talk about \"Chinese can only copy\" is similar to the pre-WW2 sentiment in USA and UK. This has caused many pilots to enter combat with superiority complex, fully confident in their own skills and machines. This has cost them their lives. Yes, maybe J20 is not great. But it is also possible that industrial espionage combined with domestic research allowed Chinese to build true state of the art fighter. Be prepared. Stay vigilant.",
         "I've addressed the AIM-174 and AIM-260 in another reply. The gist of it, is that the former is currently used by the US Navy, and the latter almost certainly isn't meeting the 2024 production claim.\n\nAs such, the capability of F-35 guiding missiles from F-15EX at targets hundreds of miles away, probably currently doesn't exist. It might become true in the next few years, but not as of right now.",
         "No I'm not, because the claim isn't \"F-35 can guide missiles\"; the claim is \"F-35 guiding missiles fired by F-15EX at targets hundreds of miles away\". I'm saying that it can't do that, because there isn't a missile available to the F-15EX with enough range to make it happen. And AFAIK, that is true."
