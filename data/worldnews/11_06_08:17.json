         "Russian investment is paying off.",
         "Not sure if I'm being dramatic, but it feels a bit like the US have finally crossed the Rubicon with this result. Trump in by mandate by winning the electoral college and popular vote, and effectively in control of all branches of Government with a mojority in both houses and control of the Supreme Court. Feels a bit ominous. Particularly if he envisages a system more akin to Russia, with the rebalance and shifting of power to the executive branch and greater influence of oligarchs.",
         "Well the EU needs their own Marshall plan, a strong defence and develop new partners around the world. We can not hide behind UN resolutions, the US defence, and only go for the short time cash. That is for sure. \n\nVoters of Europe, no matter right or left, we have to take some serius action. \n\nNo more Russian gas, Chines tiktok or cheap products, no matter how tempting. No more voting with the short term gains. \n\nThis may cost A LOT. Like developing African future partners, Mercosur, or maybe India. \n\nThis however must be done if our future should not be so \"gloomy\"",
         "Well at least we can look forward to bigger paychecks, no crime and all wars ended 'in three days' like this piece of shit promised everyone. Fools.",

         "Russia West. \n\nCongrats you drooling boors - 33 years after winning the Cold War, you've found a way to lose it. \n\nBravo America.",
         "Russia has been waiting for this. They may have not made it to Kyiv in 72 hours, but they have the resources and the manpower to wait. And now the moment has come. \n\nShameful to see what the US has become, from the Cold War days to basically being on the verge of becoming a Russian asset",

         "If there is any hope for the rest of the world, it's that fascists normally move to consolidate their own domestic power first and punish internal opposition\n\nAmerica will have future elections, but they'll be like the ones we see in places like Hungary where the ruling party controls the apparatus of the whole process and manipulates themselves favourable results whilst putting up the veneer of a token opposition to keep the illusion of choice and freedom alive\n\nThis was a direction of travel since about 2000 when a dumb electorate chose a guy they'd \"rather have a beer with\" over someone who had been at the heart of an otherwise golden period. They could have voted for more of the same and gone from strength to strength, in a world that was opening up, but instead they voted for a moronic Bush \n\nThe bottom line though is that this isn't about Russia interference (and never was). Americans who've been denial since 2016 had better face up to the glaring truth .... this is who you are. \n\nA lot more are very comfortable living under some christiofacist system than America is comfortable about admitting",
         "I don\u2019t think people understand the scale of Russia\u2019s mass manipulation of Americans for this election. A majority of these big right wing social media accounts are ran by Russia, this has been going on for years. Years of Russia spreading mass fear through America and converting more and more people to vote red. We\u2019re now seeing the result of this.",
         "The US has been put on an authoritarian isolationist path. The whole world looks at you with disgust this day. You have maybe doomed Taiwan and Ukraine while weakening Nato, Japan, the EU and Australia. \n\nWhen your enemies cheer and your friends fear, you know you have fallen.",

         "Time for us Europeans to stand up and unite. Stop relying on the uneducated masses across the Atlantic.\n\n\nWhile I loved the US, it is very clear that they can't be relied on with a government that changes every 4 years. So unite and show that Europe always has been on the forefront of civilisation.",
         "Great work Republicans, you gave the election to Russia, real smart stuff there",
         "Europe will have to step up against Russia because Trump is for the most part a Russian puppet. I predict that he\u2019ll try to force Ukraine into de jure surrendering some territory.",
         "Why are so many people here surprised that Americans did this again? Trump lets them hate openly, that's what they love about him. \n\nJust look through all the comments in the different threads. Not a single Trump voter showing even an ounce of humility. Not even celebrating their own victory. They're all just ecstatic to be able to hurl abuse at the Democrats and LGBTQ community.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>better start seeking shelter you fruity hair colored weirdos\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>No more woke bullshit next year. America is fucking back!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>hahahaha lefties in shambles. just gotta get rid of those woke idiots now.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>YES! Trump will restore the hard working culture and family values I grew up with. Can't wait.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>No more of this gender bullshit finally.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>Europe better get ready to pay for their problems themselves.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>Ooooh I thought Kamala had already won? No? But reddit told me so for weeks. :(\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>Looks like nobody actually voted for that witch.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>Reddit has been full of Dem propaganda for weeks now, but no threads about Trump winning?",
         "I hope all Americans get the proper fascist ass fuck so they realize what they have done. Fucking incredible that this was even a question on who to vote.",
         "Russia won the war without ever firing a shot. Through pure social media influence they've eroded 50 years of work in 15 years.",
         "They're not even gonna be subtle about this shit anymore.",
         "From the article:  \n\n\n>*Around the time of Trump's victory speech early Tuesday morning, Medvedev posted on Telegram his response to the election night.*\n\n>*Without directly congratulating the*\u00a0[*Republican*](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/republican)\u00a0*candidate, Medvedev referred to how there was a \"furious bipartisan anti-Russian consensus on Capitol Hill.\"*\n\n>*\"But Trump has one quality that is useful for us\u2014as a businessman to the core, he hates spending money on \u2026 idiotic allies, stupid charity projects and voracious international organizations,\" he said, referring to global support for Ukraine.*",
         "USA officially Putin\u2019s bitch now.",
         "Russia and like-minded behind-the-scenes oligarchs conquered America and they never even had to drop a bomb.\n\nThey just weaponized social media and Americans ate up the lies and spit them out as 'truth'...gleefully.\nThey realized conquering by physical force was not the way, you just simply indoctrinate the minds and you've won.\n\nThe propaganda worked, the billionaire troll farms were effective. They can push through anything they want and sway public opinion, and they have the full compliance of those in power to legitimize it as well now. \nAnd they have the means to make every person dumber and less educated going forward, making it even easier to nudge the majority in whatever direction they want.\n\n\nAmerica is now a very powerful puppet state.\nDemonstrated and proven tonight.",
         "Congrats Putin on the win!\n\nSorry for Europe\n\nRegardless what happens to trump, a republican majority will probably pull back Ukraine funding at the very least. I mean his first impeachment was all about Ukraine, all I can hope now is that's the most damage he could do, but with a conservative majority in the entire federal government I doubt it'll stop there",
         "America is no longer an ally and the sooner Europe realises this the better",
         "No kidding! NATO and Ukraine are about to be hobbled like never before. The E.U. Might have to come up with an independent defence pact to negate U.S. dissent.",
         "Putin can invade Europe as his puppet won't stop him. Fascist world government coming. Hitler would be proud.",
         "Russia finally won the Cold War.",
         "Yeah.. A Russian puppet is the best Russia could get... RIP Ukraine",
         "Of course it will. This outcome will destroy America, that's what most of the east wants. This is the best possible outcome for Russia, China, and North Korea -- a destabilized, weak, and crumbling America. No one to keep them in check anymore, and they will become the top superpowers of the world.",
         "A weaker and more polarized selfish USA is all that Putin needs to close his circle on Europe.",
         "What a moronic nation you are, truly sad that US have so much influence over the world and that american stupidity and shortsightedness will fuck over not them only.",
         "Enjoy the russian asset in white house, he already sold you out.",
         "\n\nSadly, I do think this current situation will sour an entire generation of young voters to just stop voting, give up and not care anymore. The system just wasn\u2019t built for them and they got hit with a brutal reality of that. They got their information, did what they had to do, got out there and did their civic duty\u2026and it was for nothing. All they can do is look out for themselves. Their young lives will have that guys fingerprints all over it for the rest of their existence. Hope I\u2019m wrong. \n\nLet\u2019s face it. In the real world, bad guys prevail such a terrible amount of the time.",
         "Goodbye Ukraine, you were all very brave.",
         "Now they just need to hold the line until Trump pulls the plug. The EU won't be able to pick up the slack and they'll be able to roll the whole country because then it really does just become a war of attrition. Why negotiate for the Donbass when for a few more measly Russian lives you can have the whole lot?\n\nA sad day and a firm blot on Biden's presidency. He *could* have helped them properly, none of this tying of their hands. But he chose not to, for fear of alienating voters, and look what it got him and the Dems. Could say the same about Gaza. They're done now. Lets see what happens with Taiwan.\n\nIt'll probably be the subtitle to his term: 'Could-and should-have done more'.",
         "The US is the laughing stock of the entire world. They are absolutely pathetic.",
         "Just useful? Ukraine war is over as Trump will end all support. Gaza is going to get a rude awakening on what it\u2019s like when the US President says \u201cDo what you want\u201d and everyone is going to get a reminder of what a bad economy looks like but Trump can blame Biden for the next 10 years so that doesn\u2019t really matter.\n\nMy response to the complaints - it\u2019s what 80% of America voted for.",
         "Goodbye America, you were something for 200+ years. It sucks you threw it all away for a snake oil salesman",
         "Sigh. Hubris after the end of Cold War 1.0 is the downfall of the US.",

         "Russia just wants Americans at odds with each other.  Screw them",
         "My wife is Ukrainian. She lost her home she grew up in. Her old grandfather was killed at his home by the Russians. She dis not even get to bury him. Now her country is going to be gone. This is very sad",

         "To all of Ukraine: I am sorry. You guys are fucked. The inbred cousin fuckers elected the dictator\u00a0",
         "Pray for the Ukraine. Don\u2019t want to imagine the fear and hopelessness they now must feel",
         "Disgusting. \n\nI don't care that much if the Americans elect an orange gorilla, but I fear for the Ukrainians and their fate.",
         "Gotta tip your hat to Putin\n\nHe is an asshole but he is a mastermind asshole\n\nHe has totally destabilized his adversary with nothing but a bunch of nerds and a minimal budget",
         "Hey, it\u2019s what American people want. Again. For some dumbass reason.",
         "Poor Ukraine",
         "Yes, he is their Useful Idiot. \u2639\ufe0f",
         "That's it America, you just sided with the guy who kills his critics and blows planes out of the sky for fun.",
         "Day 1",

         "Congratulations America you are once again a worldwide laughing stock. Also good luck Ukraine, you guys are gonna need it.",
         "Of course it is, they'll have indirect control of the USA from January 20th on.",
         "It's all over.",
         "This is one time I think Kremlin is speaking truth.",
         "No shit, they got their man in. Bribed or not, they'll prefer a clown as leader than an actual politician. Sheesh. WW3 will be won by another alliance it seems.",
         "Nobody is even hiding the fact that Trump is licking the balls of Putin. In 2016 it was still a conspiracy",
         "Putin must be fully erect by this point. After all, he's running America now.",
         "I wonder how many Americans will blame Russia for Trump's election instead of accepting the fact that their fellow countrymen are just that stupid.",
         "I lost all respect for America today. Like seriously!? You\u2019re electing a convicted felon, rapist dictator",
         "The US pretty much sold out their democracy to Russia and some greedy Billionaires.",
         "Ah yes. Can\u2019t wait for a Russian loving convicted felon to pardon himself of all crimes then in-still himself as a dictator. Project 2025 is here and it\u2019s going to hit the US *hard*. \n\nEveryone tried to warn them, but the people have spoken. We\u2019re all going to look back on this in a few months and say \u2018Not gonna say I told you so!\u2019",
         "This is what happens when half a country can't point to Europe on a map. Really sucks for the other half that actually lives in the real world. Come on down to Australia if you want, we're not much better but at least we're not riddled with paranoia and guns.",
         "Everyone who is not a complete moron already knew this.",
         "Good job America, you gave the dictators of the world exactly what they wanted.",
         "Fuck you, Donald Trump. AMERICA LOST TONIGHT. CONGRATS TO PUTIN.",
         "Watch trump was sanctions as a \u201cgesture of good will\u201d to allow \u201cfruitful negotiations\u201d on ending the Ukraine war. Mark my words.",
         "Slow clap fellow Americans, really good job here.",
         "No shit it's useful. Ukraine is DOA. Europe is squeezed between totalitarian super-powers.",
         "So disappointed",
         "I am incredibly disappointed, this was my single issue and why I voted for Harris. But by the same token it's pathetic that most of NATO still hasn't even met the defense spending requirements of NATO this long after Trump's first term. Much less prepare for the inevitable war once Ukraine falls or better yet meaningfully support Ukraine. That is an actually insane level of complacency from most of a continent that has a massive war already going on. I hope NATO will survive without us, but I just don't see it, we've had almost a decade of European leaders saying they need to learn to be independent of the USA, but those words have amounted to no action at all.",
         "Well done USA. The world is laughing at you.",
         "Russia has won the cold war.",
         "I feel sorry for Ukraine.  This winter just got really cold for them.",

         "Hopefully this just mean Biden has two months to load Ukraine up to the nose with weapons.",
         "Congratulations to Vladimir Putin for winning the 2024 U.S. election",
         "Ukraine is fucked now. The shitty alternate timeline took over once again.",
         "\"If I'm elected, I'll make sure you never have to vote again\".... America is full of fucking morons.",
         "When I was a kid, I used to think that the average American was smarter that the rest of Earth's people, you just had to look at their achievements, but yeah, the naivety of youth.",
         "Of course, but would you expect the brain-rotted Americans to understand this or as to why? \n\nNo. \n\nBecause they supported a rapist. America has always been rooted and filled with scum, how else did we get an abomination like Dump for president and many of those who came before him.",
         "So The Americans was actually a real life documentary all along?",
         "Americans willingly voting for a known Putin supporter is absolutely wild to me.",
         "In the coming weeks, I would expect Trump to hand over the keys of Ukraine to Putin!",
         "Congratulations Putin for the win. You have done what the mighty Soviets could not even dared to dream, enslavement of USA without a fight. Well played, KGB.",
         "Americans are so dumb. How are you the most powerful country in the world?",
         "RIP Ukraine.",
         "As A Ukrainian, I am super scared of what is to come. JD Vance literally said they don't care about Ukraine and Trump is blatanly pro-Russian as well as funded by them. Fucking hell.",

         "Hey Europe.  The ones of us in the US who aren't warped in the mind tried.  And failed.  So, if you want to turn the tide in Ukraine and against Russia, you may have to do it yourselves for a bit.  Our system of spending the kind of money on defense we do, making us the big savior, while you spend much more of yours on social stuff and education, had finally backfired. \n\nYou should probably get together and counter Russia while you can.  With any luck, we still have some old military brass who still see wisdom.",
         "This directly contradicts what I just heard on CNN where a current Russian official says they won\u2019t congratulate trump and that him winning doesn\u2019t change that Russia and USA are enemies.",
         "At this point, I don't think Putin even has blackmail material. I think he just sends in Vodka for the weekend.  Oligarchy bros.",

         "Poland and Estonia are probably shitting their pants...",
         "Oh please, Russia is fucked either way. Their disastrous war has created a massive brain drain. Anyone in the Mid East or Thailand can attest to the fact that the Russians have been flocking in droves for the past few years. They won't be going back anytime soon. \n\n\nRussia has willingly bled itself of all its top talent and much of its middle and upper class. They can celebrate all they want, but their nation is in an absolute death spiral. Once Putin croaks, which is quickly coming, things will really pop off over there. Their worst days lie ahead.",

They think Trump is the devil they know, but 2024 Trump is a completely different animal, as there is nobody to tell him no this time, and his handpicked Supreme Court has given him carte blanche to do whatever the fuck he wants.",
         "Trump is more useful to Russia than Vance. Vance is a Peter Theil puppet.",

         "I don't doubt that played some part in it, but it's also just the sad truth that the general electorate, even my fellow leftists, are selfish morons and don't understand cause and effect. All those on the left that turned out in 2020 did so after suffering through four years of Trump and seeing how bad it was. But since they haven't had to deal with Trump being in charge the last four years, they didn't feel as motivated to come out.\n\nThen there's, of course, the mixture of sexism and racism. Harris was a poor choice to put forward. She lost the 2020 primaries *bad*. She was called out, including by me, as a bad VP pick in 2020. And then Biden, who said he'd be a one term president, went back on that and ran. And he didn't drop out until it was far too late to hold an actual primary and find a more pragmatic and strategic choice.\n\nAll in all, this wasn't a victory for Trump. It was a complete and utter self own by the left/Democrats.",
         "Essentially, yes. Because as I said in a different comment, the sad truth is the general electorate are selfish morons that don't understand cause and effect/pragmatism.\n\nAfter suffering through four years of Trump, they were more than happy and motivated to go out and vote. But since they haven't had to deal with him in power for the last four years, they became complacent and unmotivated.",

         "Yeah, recency bias is big here. On the upside, that means that Democrats will almost certainly win in 2028. Assuming you even have an election then, Trump's been pretty open about wanting to destroy democracy.",
         "I think it's more sexism than racism according to data on the demographics. Black and Latino men mostly voted for Trump. I can't see a good reason they would prefer Biden over Harris apart from sexism.",

Well it's because they use the same currency, now I'm no professional economist but do you know back then when Greece was in recession and the whole of Europe was trying to bail Greece out.

Democrats listened to their own hype AGAIN, assuming they would have an easy victory by running someone who wasn\u2019t a good pick. Apparently far less popular than Hillary in 2020. Absolutely insane that Trump might actually win the popular vote. \n\nYou can\u2019t insult voters/potential voters into voting the way you want. A LOT of people stayed home. Insulting and slandering them, or anyone else on the fence for that matter, thus doubling down on the divisive behavior you claim to stand against rather than even attempting to convince other people only further contributed to less enthusiasm. It even pushes people to vote the other way. Why would anyone want to support your platform when you immediately jump to insults if they show any reluctance to blindly support your views? They\u2019d rather not vote (at least for a President) at all if neither candidate seems like a good fit, even if someone is and they just don\u2019t have all of the information that could convince them otherwise. Shitting on people does nothing and many of you here commenting here and elsewhere are doing a wonderful job showing how it isn\u2019t just Trump pushing people not to get involved. \n\nDemocrats and the people who are upset and involved in politics, whether directly or just out there trying to convince voters in their own time, have a long four years to get it together. Hopefully there will be a lot of learning done after this, because this is about to be a really long term full of controversies. The fact that a felon looks to have actually won is absolutely ridiculous. People can rage downvote this if it makes them feel better, but this is absolutely a near repeat of 2016, and the result of a mix of complacency and arrogance after winning 2020. It\u2019s going to take a major shift in results right now to prevent Trump from reaching 270 at this point. Edit: It\u2019s over. He won. \n\nI really hope Ukraine survives a Trump presidency.

We stood at an inflection point in 68 and chose Nixon... and just after assassinating two Kennedys, multiple civil rights leaders, murdering countless normal people, etc.\n\nThe really sad thing is they thought they were turning a new leaf and a lot of what the country considered radical race issues, labor issues, etc today haven't changed much since then. And nor has the counter rhetoric, and beliefs of the other side and aristocracy. It is mindblowing because I was under the impression that a lot of the philosophy and praxis was new... not 40-60 years old. It is also crazy to remember that the people terrorizing black people with bombs, the military and police shooting live rounds during unrest, etc aren't that removed from us. They likely have living grandchildren. Much of those whose families had power and status still do and their thinking likely hasn't changed much. \n\nWe just elected the newest in the line of eugenecists, robber barrons, christofacists, upper class' inbred children who never worked a common job nor made a living through merit nor service, and segregationists. \n\nIt never has been, but the counter culture without power has always been there. At back doors, in underground bars, behind drawn curtains and closed doors. Occasionally banding together to march and create movements at the price of total disenfranchisement for having participated or having been outed.

They are too young. \n\n-also I\u2019m not completely anti abortion but I would never recommend my wife/girlfriend do it. There should be some protections I believe.\n\nI also got really tired of being labeled a racist and facist by the left because I don\u2019t agree on every issue with them. I\u2019m a regular dude with different opinions. But the left thinks I\u2019m bringing doomsday to the world and am the worst person on earth. I voted Biden in 2020.",

He knows how to manipulate these good people's  attention and emotion for his own gain.

         "Oct 7th was a Shin Bet failure, not Mossad\n\nShin Bet is like their FBI. They handle intelligence about Gaza/West Bank because the potential threats are domestic. \n\nMossad is like their CIA. They handle foreign operations",
         "The pager attack was against hezbollah, not hamas. Hamas apparently was able to do Oct 7 because bibis government was so convinced that hamas just wanted to rule gaza so much that they wouldn't launch a wreckless attack/war on israel, because the consequences for doing so we're never in doubt. The idf and security aparetus was mainly deployed along the west bank and northern border areas because they feared hezbollah and terror infiltration as a more likely threat to Israel than Gaza. Judging by the docs they've since found in Lebanon and the west bank they were right to be worried about that, but completely failed israelis when it came to defending against hamas in gaza. They even saw iranian trained and armed militants rehearsing the attack, but when fed up the chain of command, all they got back was, \"hamas knows they're not capable of pulling off a victorious assault like that and won't try it.\"\n\nEdit: in contrast, israel has been preparing for an eventual war with hezbollah since shortly after 2004. Hence, the instant decisive blows they were able to achieve when they felt they could focus their military efforts to the north to try to return their displaced civilians back to their homes and stop the daily rocket/mortar/drone attacks from sourhern Lebanon.",

         "Some of the hostages are young female soldiers that had been reporting that there are increased training and drills by Hamas near the border and they were ignored.",
         "The reason for that is because Israel was prepared for tensions in the north, but didn't take the idea of a threat to the south as seriously until it actually happened.",
         "They did know, they were warned by both the US and Egypt (and potentially others) days and weeks in advance, and Israel had the battle plan more than a year prior, and were warned three months in advance by their own intelligence that Hamas had carried out training per the plan.\n\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/30/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-attack-intelligence.html",
         "It really isn't. \n\nIt's different people doing different things. The latter is essentially a supply chain attack, something that's familiar only to people working cyber security and only since about 2018. What made the exploding battery plan possible was that it was the first of it's kind and utterly unexpected.\n\nThe October 7th attack was the opposite end of the spectrum. It benefited from being low tech, played close to the chest but also being so ambitious it sounded like nonsense. The issue most inteligence agencies face isn't that they don't hear about an attack, it's that they hear about a hundred planned attacks and usually zero actually happen.",

         "That\u2019s pretty accurate.\n\nNetanyahu was being charged with corruption and facing trial.\n\nSo he devised a plan to fundamentally change the Justice System in a way that would conveniently allow him to make the dead to rights corruption charges no longer matter.\n\nThere were nationwide protests including citizens serving Israel\u2019s mandatory military service refusing to report for duty (very illegal).\n\nAs this was all coming to a head and his consolidation of power over the Justice System was about to occur the 10/7 attack happened.\n\nNetanyahu then negotiated with the largest opposition parties in Parliament and it was agreed upon that the Justice System reforms AND new elections would be put on hold until the military actions resulting from the 10/7 attack were finished.\n\nSo now the war hawk Prime Minister is protected from the consequences of his corruption so long as he keeps finding ways to continue military operations.",

The CIA lied to the FBI and refused to tell them about several AQ members knew were already inside the US. The CIA officials who concealed this information were on a joint agency Bin Laden task force that lawfully required them to share intel with the FBI. They broke the law out of inter-agency rivalry and hubris, so the FBI never received the intel on the hijackers until it was already too late to arrest them. The FBI agent leading the FBI arm of the Bin Laden task force was also muscled out of his leadership role by the Bush Administration because he was too loud about the issue, and he went on to become the director of security at the World Trade Center and was killed in one of the tower collapses. The CIA officials responsible for lying to be FBI were allowed to keep their identities secret by the 9/11 Commission, though it is strongly suspected the woman who later received credit for finding Bin Laden is in fact the lead Bin Laden task force member who directed the CIA arm to keep the FBI in the dark.",

What was planned was a glorious thunder rush to the West Bank before turning North and driving Israel into the sea.\n\nAnd this wasn't the only ongoing plan. With terrorist groups you can usually expect tens or hundreds of them to be in some stage of planning at any given time, most coming to absolutely nothing.\n\nThose that do come to something tend to be the smaller, more targeted, less ambitious ones, so there's a strong bias against the major, country ending plots.\n\nIt was a failure and one that should end many careers, but it's a very understandable fuck up.

         "Sorry, I'm going off Gaza's population of 2.4 mil.  I did not catch that GP said \"Palestinian\" not just Gaza.  \n  \nAnd yes, The Lancet estimated 180K deaths back in July...it must be well over 200K by now.  \n  \n> In recent conflicts, such indirect deaths range from three to 15 times the number of direct deaths. Applying a conservative estimate of four indirect deaths per one direct death to the 37\u2009396 deaths reported, it is not implausible to estimate that up to 186\u2009000 or even more deaths could be attributable to the current conflict in Gaza. Using the 2022 Gaza Strip population estimate of 2\u2009375\u2009259, this would translate to 7\u00b79% of the total population in the Gaza Strip. A report from Feb 7, 2024, at the time when the direct death toll was 28\u2009000, estimated that without a ceasefire there would be between 58\u2009260 deaths (without an epidemic or escalation) and 85\u2009750 deaths (if both occurred) by Aug 6, 2024.  \n  \nAnd...it is also important to note that not all of these deaths have actually occurred at this point.  The current war has health impacts that will continue to kill people for years after the actual conflict ends.  I haven't seen any estimates recently, but I'd guess 70-80% of all structures have been destroyed.  All infrastructure has also likely been destroyed.  There are probably thousands of bodies buried in the rubble.  People we don't even know are dead yet and that aren't counted in the 45K.  Even once the war ends, Gaza will essentially be a refugee camp with people living in tents for the next decade.  Sanitation, medical care, and nutrition will continue to be huge issues that will continue to kill people (particularly children) for years after the conflict ends.",

Whatever Europe does on defense, she said, should not take away from the role of NATO and U.S. leadership of NATO.\n\nThe United States wanted to dominate European security. Then it periodically had complained that the European allies weren\u2019t spending enough on defense and weren\u2019t supporting enough of the other things the United States wanted to do. Well, it\u2019s always great to call the shots and get other countries to pay the costs. That\u2019s not a realistic approach, and so it\u2019s no surprise that we are where we are now.\"\n\nSource:\u00a0[https://carnegieendowment.org/posts/2024/04/the-united-states-stepping-back-from-europe-is-a-matter-of-when-not-whether?lang=en](https://carnegieendowment.org/posts/2024/04/the-united-states-stepping-back-from-europe-is-a-matter-of-when-not-whether?lang=en)",

I guess it's just a balancing act between avoiding escalation, helping Ukraine win and not bankrupting ourselves.",
         "This \"Trump can actually solve it\" narrative is just as cringy though. I believe that people are coping when they expect reasonable solutions from a guy who called Putin smart and criticized Zelesnky for asking for aid, in a few months we'll see what grade of copium that is.",
         "But Trump is interested because they have so much kompromat on him. He's fucking over the USA because he's being blackmailed. \n\nIt's not that complicated. He just does what he's told. \n\nAnd Russia has always been a hostile foreign state. Did you forget the Cold War? \n\nThe old skool republicans will be turning in their grave if they could see this.",

Lets just wait and see... personally I really don't see Trump ruining the American economy, but if you want to bet on that go ahead.",
         "Those two are not mutually exclusive. He can care about himself and do what Putin wants. And it's not like Trump needs to do everything Putin wants to benefit Russia, sometimes it's just enough not to do anything. And Putin would very much like that.",

All I've ever seen is conspiracy crap.\n\nI've no doubt Trump has business ties with Russia, because lots of people do/did and Russia wasn't the bad guy until after Trump was booted out. We have a fucking Oligarch in our House of Lords here in the UK. Madness.\n\nBut being on friendly terms with Russia because they had billions floating around due to being massive, resource rich, and corrupt as hell after the Soviet Union fell, is not the same as allowing them to wreak havoc over wherever they like. \n\nWorse case scenario, which I'm still a little fearful of, is you guys are *so* wrong that Trump goes all out and decides to send a warning shot nuke.",

This section ensures that incriminating evidence provided to a parliamentary committee may not be used directly in subsequent criminal proceedings except in a prosecution for perjury or for the giving of contradictory evidence. However, it is important to point out that in spite of the legal protections available to witnesses, the possibility exists that as a result of media coverage of the committee proceedings the possibility of a fair hearing in court could still be compromised. For example, while a committee's minutes would not be admissible at a criminal trial, the testimony could assist a police investigation or direct a Crown prosecutor to a line of questioning useful for his or her purposes which otherwise might have been unavailable for the purpose of prosecuting the offence. Again, in such circumstances, the committee may wish to consider holding\u00a0in camera\u00a0proceedings.\n\n[Source](http://www.revparl.ca/english/issue.asp?art=1030&param=152)\n\nSo, a witness at a parliamentary committee must answer the questions, but what is said can not be used as evidence in a criminal trial.",

There's probably sexual predators in my community like any other community, but I haven't heard anyone say pedophilia is okay, but I have heard plenty of them say homosexuality/Transsexuality shouldn't be allowed.\n\nAgain, its hard to understand if you haven't been brought up with it, but the prophet is the exception, not the norm, Anything the prophet does is considered to be sanctioned by god, and doesn't apply to the general Muslim population."

It's as if reality holds no grounds anymore. Go visit Iran (as many YouTubers have) and then make YOUR OWN decision about their culture, lifestyle and/or how oppresive it is. \n\nIn regards to women and being safe. The more Islamic a country's government is and the more they prescribe the \"headscarf\" (the thing Mother Mary wore), the less rape and sexual assault occurs in the country, because, the sole reasons of the headscarf  is that it is mandated by God and that it is to protect a women's chastity \u2014 we know how women get treated when they show their bodies off and objectify themselves. \n\nA woman is more likely to get assaulted in England, France, Namibia, The U.S, Sweeden or Botswana than she is in Iran, Saudi Arabia, or Afghanistan (the only countries that have MANDATED the headscarf). Out of the top 50 countries with the highest rates of rape only 4 are \"headscarf wearing ones\" (Pakistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Turkey). In other words, a woman is safer in a headscarf wearing country than in a non headscarf wearing one.\n\nThe reason a woman might feel \"oppressed\" is because she wants to show her self off, or doesn't believe in what God has mandated, it's simple. Now, should women be allowed to dress in booty shorts if she desired, or be legally forced to cover herself up in public is the debate to have. Using the \"safety\" argument is a misnomer.\n\nDon't be biased, be fair.",

This was the chance to rebuild trust between the two nations. The fallout of Bush winning the 2000 are still with us\n\n> Iranian president Mohammad Khatami and Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei condemned and denounced the attacks and the terrorists who carried them out. Iranians who gathered for a soccer match in Tehran two days after the 9/11 attacks observed a moment of silence. There was also a candlelight vigil. Huge crowds attended candlelit vigils in Iran, and 60,000 spectators observed a minute's silence at Tehran's soccer stadium. On Tuesday, September 25, in 2001, Khatami meeting British Foreign Secretary, Jack Straw, said: \"Iran fully understands the feelings of the Americans about the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington on September 11.\" He said although the American administrations had been at best indifferent about terrorist operations in Iran (since 1979), the Iranians instead felt differently and had expressed their sympathetic feelings with bereaved Americans in the tragic incidents in the two cities.\" He also stated that \"Nations should not be punished in place of terrorists.\" According to Radio Farda's website, in 2011, on the anniversary of the attacks, United States Department of State, published a post at its blog, in which the Department thanked Iranian people for their sympathy and stated that they would never forget Iranian people's kindness on those harsh days. This piece of news at Radio Farda's website also states that after the attacks' news was released, some Iranian citizens gathered in front of the Embassy of Switzerland in Tehran, which serves as the protecting power of the United States in Iran, to express their sympathy and some of them lit candles as a symbol of mourning.",

Something of the past.\n\nAlso, what you're saying is stupid anyway.\n\nIn the Koran Allah literally gives Israel to the jews. But he also claim it back, just after.\n\n> O my people! Enter the Holy Land which Allah has destined for you \u02f9to enter\u02fa. And do not turn back or else you will become losers.\u201d\n\n5.2\n\n>  Allah made a covenant with the Children of Israel and appointed twelve leaders from among them and \u02f9then\u02fa said, \u201cI am truly with you.

And whoever among you disbelieves afterwards has truly strayed from the Right Way.\u201d\n\n5.12\n\nBut literally the next part is how the jews fucked up, and betrayed Allah :\n\n> But for breaking their covenant We condemned them and hardened their hearts.

Their designs on being a regional hegemon, so I doubt it. Though I will say I did feel for a long time that post 9/11 us-iranian relations were super mishandled by the us (as well as of course iran), but all bush really said was no thank you to iranian help in Iraq, and the Iranians took that as a slight to their national honor and prestige. For all we know, the Iranian foreign ministry was just trying to alienate the us from its Arab and Jewish allies in the region. Seeing how they stoke the flames of war and hate in the region more and more since the us has been withdrawing it's presence in the region, and especially since 10/7, leads me to believe Iran just has an easier time lying to appear like the rational actor... or rational to them just means something entirely different to the us.",

This OSAT is the sanctioned party in this case. When the GF salesperson (or account exec, etc) attempted to validate that the OSAT was valid, the trade compliance software approved the transfer so it went through. It wasn\u2019t until a later audit where they found that the information for this particular OSAT was misentered into the system so when it should\u2019ve been blocked, it wasn\u2019t.

Where we have to be more careful is at the 2nd level of contractors and distributors - they are obviously not the end user, and usually their customer is not either, so obtaining and screening the information becomes even more important, and time consuming.  \n\nOn a side note - this also clears up something I was wondering about.

For example, you could have a corporation that has been clean since the start, and then one department, does cross the line. You expect every new hire and every department to know about the illegal activity? No, it would be almost impossible for new hires to know and for other departments, the probability would be very low.\n\nOn top of that, employees might fear that if they report something, it might end up with the corporate death penalty, which means if they report it, it could end up in them losing their jobs. We already have to have laws on the books for whistleblowing already, where if the whistleblower receives reprisals, they can sue the company for those reprisals. And that doesn't always help out.\n\nThe only time that a corporate death penalty would be acceptable is if their whole business is built on illegal activity.

In total the (completely peaceful, btw) protests have been occuring weekly for over 1.5 years, with an average turnout of thousands to tens of thousands of people.\n\nNetanyahu has really made himself hated by the public, first by trying to come after our judicial system before Oct 7. and again after it was made clear the hostages are not a priority for him.

There is an demerit point system but rich people pay other people to take the points for them (and get the fine put in the paid persons name), while the fine a third of some people\u2019s fortnightly income.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nI haven\u2019t had a speeding fine for a few years, but people regularly drive 10-20km below the speed limit in fear of fines and they haven\u2019t figured out that cruise control exists (seems to be the majority) and/or haven\u2019t realised that cars built after the late 2000s ALL show that they are going faster than they actually are, under government regulations, so you need to learn your car\u2019s individual speedo (eg my car says it\u2019s going 103 if it\u2019s doing 100, some cars say 110 if they\u2019re doing 100)! It\u2019s seriously not uncommon to get stuck behind some dickhead doing 60 or 70 in the right lane (the faster lane) on the freeway (usually limit is 100), holding up a line of cars behind them. Oh, it\u2019s painful getting back on the road here after being in Europe, I tell ya!\u00a0\n\nI once got a fine for doing 85 in an 80 zone as I was rolling down a steep hill and took my eyes off the speedo for a moment because there was a lot of other things happening on the road. Or one time when I was doing 46 in a roadworks zone on the freeway in the middle of the night at around 1am (where the speeds are reduced to 40 km/h as the works are in progress, but often the works aren\u2019t actually in progress), and there were no other cars around.\u00a0\n\nBoom, three quarters of my weekly rent money at the time gone just like that.

If they aren't enforcing law on Korean people and entities, which probably make up 95% of the total, then that's what that country would be; a land of lawlessness. \n\nLiterally, the CEO of Korea's largest company was imprisoned, and after bail is still facing legal consequences and additional trials.

Lots of people don\u2019t seem to use it though. Your eyes are always half on the speedo, when I go overseas it feels so freeing, like the leeway is 10 mph or so (about 15 km/h?) in Britain, so you\u2019re not always stressing about going 5 km/h above the limit by accident. And the speed cameras there are VERY clearly signed with multiple warnings. Not sure if there are mobile cameras but I don\u2019t get worried about it there because you\u2019re safe if you go a couple of k\u2019s over by accident. The fixed cameras here are signed and in places where accidents are more common (in order to deter people from speeding in those places) but the hiding of mobile cameras in sneaky places - especially at the bottom of hills - just to catch people out who are otherwise driving safely really shits me.\u00a0",

It was just completely foreign to them, literally.\n\nI'm going to try again this winter at Cruz Roja to see if there is any growing interest in training, now that people are taking climate change more seriously. There is so much that people can do before, during, and after a disaster, other than sitting around waiting for \"the government\" to do it all.\n\nAnd I think now that my Spanish is getting better, I'll get involved in local campaigning for candidates who take climate change and social responsibility very seriously.",

But stealth shape is terrible for aerodynamics, and especially aircraft stability and control. That\u2019s where the software comes in, to compensate for the aerodynamic instability of the aircraft. In addition to all the weapon and countermeasure systems.",
         "Not just that. Those high tech avionics are needed because these planes often trade better flight performance for a little extra stealth. It\u2019s hard to make control surfaces for a stealthy fighter, for instance, without compromising the stealth. They have to make a lot of unconventional choices for their control surfaces as a result, which makes flying the plane without some kind of computer assisted control really difficult, basically impossible really. Plus, it gives a significant advantage to our pilots by allowing them to focus on other tasks by freeing up some of the attention needed to maneuver the plane. \n\nThe reality is that Russia is way way behind us in terms of knowledge on how to build planes with minimal RCS. They try to compromise for this a bit by building a larger aircraft that can accommodate more powerful radars so the Su-57 can, in theory at least, detect a threat long before it gets close enough to target the Su-57. However, against a proper stealth fighter like an F-22 or F-35, those aircraft would still probably get target lock and take down an Su-57 before they even knew what hit them, because it\u2019s basically invisible on radar, especially next to a monster like the Su-57 that sticks out on radar like a sore thumb. These planes are actually stealthy enough to sneak through radar contested airspace with relative ease, something the Su-57 could never do.",

The SU-57 is even directionally unstable, in addition to being longitudinally unstable and, by all accounts, appears to have excellent control characteristics. \n\nIt's very much the stealth aspect of it, i.e. the materials, the build quality, the ability to shape the aircraft, ect.",

         "That\u2019s a small reason really. I think their main reasoning actually has more to do with the engine designs they have available, which is also a area where they are pretty far behind. They are catching up with their fighter jet engines slowly, even if their stealth tech still sucks. \n\nI think they were able to reach their goal with the engines of the Su-57 performance wise, but that\u2019s about as small as they could make them. And, as it stands, they are way bigger than the f-22s engines and require a lot more fuel. They still have an impressive thrust to weight ratio, but the fact it is bigger means you still have to carry more fuel and make the plane itself bigger to make room for all that. These things mean the stealth aspects of the design have to be that much better to adequately conceal the airframe from enemy radar. \n\nSo basically, as a stealth fighter, the Su-57 is a joke compared to the F-22 or F-35. But in a more general sense, like if we\u2019re talking air superiority or multirole aircraft roles, the superior stealth capabilities of these planes goes a long, long way.

The computing power of the USSR in the 80s was comparable to the US in the 60s and had barely grown since the late 60s. By the end of the 80s the soviet computer industry was only starting seeing implementation of integrated circuit and transistors. There was a reason that the soviet computer industry basically disappeared as soon as the iron curtain fell as it could not compete with the international standards and was absolutely tiny compare everyone else.\n\nOn the other hand the only reason that the US started using the Pyotr's paper was because there was already a push to design a low radar return aircraft and the method to do so was really expensive requiring a mockup to be built and stood up in front of a radar array every time changes were made. But it turns out having massive computing power and wide spread consumer base using said computing power means there was easy access to calculate the necessary equations to produce a stealth aircraft using Pyotr's paper.\n\nThat's not to mention that the soviet aircraft industry was basically running of fumes since the MiG-25. Famously the western air forces was terrified of it due to its appearance and advertised specifications. The US designed the F-15 in response to it capable of matching everything the MiG-25 was advertised to do. Yet when the US got their hands on one it turned out to be huge nothing burger as the plane can do all the things it was advertised to do only to shake itself apart or melt its engines doing it.",

They occasionally even got a little ahead in some places. Naturally, it\u2019s much easier to follow rather than lead in technology. \n\nThe USSR would have got stealth jets \u201cby hook or by crook.\u201d They would have been 10 or so years behind the US, but still way before Russia and China in our timeline.",

Literally the smallest, most inconspicuous little differences amount to massively different outcomes. Every single characteristic of the plane is part of at least one design trade off of some kind. \n\nAnother priority for the Russians with the Su-57 was that it have larger weapons bays and better range than the F-22. It is also intended for a slightly different set of roles, being intended for more multirole support \u2014 especially for supporting Russia\u2019s large army forces on the ground, rather than focusing as much on air to air combat and extreme stealth/evasion capabilities. This also fits into Russia\u2019s overall doctrine where most of their aircraft are intended to be deployed over Russian controlled or friendly, radar protected airspace. Unlike the f-22, which pretty much goes where ever the fuck it wants \u2014 so long as it has the range.  Also, as an aside, it is also easier to fit and design different weapons for a larger weapon bay than a smaller one, which may be a small advantage, but that is highly dependent on mission, the actual loadouts and weapons selected, etc.\n\nIn short, Russia\u2019s strategy with these planes is to get a (small) step closer to our stealth capabilities while also producing a new fighter to replace some of their aging fleets that is sufficiently modernized to fit into their current overall strategic plans for countering NATO\u2019s power. They know their stealth tech isn\u2019t there yet, as well as other areas they run behind in, so instead they made a larger plane that can fly further and carry more weapons, which in theory may help them even the odds in a potential conflict with nato aircraft, prioritizing those features to make it work better with the rest of the Russia military and its doctrine. It doesn\u2019t try to compete with the advanced stealth or other tech we have. It\u2019s a bit of a brutish approach to airpower really, very Russian if I\u2019m being honest.",

Can the Russians field enough su-57s for this to even matter?",
         "China: quick we'll just change one letter that way **nobody** will know we stole the tech!",
         "Never happened.",
         "Well if we start seeing Saturn AL-41F1s in J20s instead of the WS-15 then we will know there have been hiccups. The J20 used to run AL-31s for a decade until China was able to make a more powerful and reliable variant of the WS-10 but it still only has a TBO of about 1500 hours and slow thrust response. Compare that to a P&W-135 of 3000-6000 hours until TBO. I will be thoroughly impressed if China has been able to overcome all of their manufacturing and quality issues and in one step make an engine that is far superior in every metric of the WS-10 and is on par with the reliability of US engines.",
         "You are basing your assumption on the early cold war. As the cold war went on soviet tech fell further and further behind. Only by brute force and careful propaganda did the USSR appear to have comparable technology by the middle of the cold war. And in the later stages of it USSR had basically bankrupted itself trying to keep up with anything. What little lead the USSR had at any stage is done for propaganda victories and not for the advancement of technology. They got the first satellite into space only because their actual first satellite they are planning was going to fail to complete manufacturing never mind launching before when the US was planning to launch their first. Thats why all sputnik did was beep. Compare to the explorer 1 which had an array of scientific instruments onboard for measuring radiation, atmosphere, temperature and even micro meteors. They had the first women in space only because the US was starting training an entire group of women to send to space. etc. Even what technology they did manage to steal is often half the necessary information. Famously they stole the plans for the uranium enrichment but not the radiation reports on the leftover materials. The russians even today are still operating liquid fuel ICBMs even on submarines because they never was able to obtain the technological know how and the expertise to manufacture long lasting solid fuel. Something the US mastered in the 60s with the minuteman series. The only thing that the soviet really kept up with the US was assassinations and regime changes.",
         "Yes, yes. Chinese are racially inferior and can't design anything complicated. Just like the Japanese. Oh wait, it is not 1938 anymore.",
         "Aw beans! Thank ya!",
         "It's pretty rad that Russia's new hotness can't hold up to our stuff from the 80's and 90's.\n\nThe Felon just came out and can't compete and the Raptor that first deployed about two decades ago...or likely even the 70's vintage F-15.\n\nAnd the NGAD and FA-XX are in the works.",
         "As a American, it\u2019s still my favorite plane from a foe, and probably the best plane the Russians produced. It was purely designed to take down the SR-71, and though it would have likely failed in its mission if it was finished in time, it\u2019s still a fascinating piece of Soviet Cold War technology.",
         ">This is nonstandard, highly misleading use of the word 'prototype.'\n\nThe only photos of Super Hornets carrying that missile are inert stand-ins, hence why I said \"prototype\".\n\nThe main point is that the F-15EX probably isn't able to carry and fire the missile.",
         "Not to mention, while the SR-71 only ever had a handful of airframes and was operated by one country, the AIM-120D is being used by multiple countries and there are thousands (?) of them. With so many operators and wide usage, if it has much more range than publicly stated, I expect to see it leaked in the Warthunder forums by now.",
         "Correct. So this capability probably doesn't exist right now.",
         "Well, that's pretty different from the initial claim of F-35 guiding missiles from F-15EX at targets hundreds of miles away, isn't it?\n\n>Can the Russians field enough su-57s for this to even matter?\n\nProbably not, but that's not what we're discussing.",

         "American companies aren\u2019t immune to not understanding the design and manufacturing processes of other countries. \n\nLook at the Toyota system. Lots of American companies wholesale copied it, and it ended up with cascading production issues when supply chains were disrupted. Toyota understood their systems and knew where they were weak, and built stockpiles in critical goods.\n\nWhen you just copy something without understanding how and why it was designed you\u2019re going to have adverse effects.",
         ">The only photos of Super Hornets carrying that missile are inert stand-ins, hence why I said \"prototype\".\n\nYep - but, again, I think there are relevant facts *beyond* the two you presented, which are useful as everyone draws their own conjectures / conclusions:\n\nYes: (1) the photos of the AIM-174b have only shown us inert stand-ins, and (2) the missile has not been publicly acknowledged to have been fired from an F/A-18.\n\nBut also: (3) the U.S. Navy has confirmed that it is operationally deployed in its air-launched configuration, and (4) the missile itself has already been used [*in combat*](https://www.twz.com/sea/navys-sm-6-missile-used-in-combat-report) in its booster-motivated configuration.\n\nIn fact, I'd caveat (1): the \"CATM\" designation [we last saw](https://theaviationist.com/2024/09/11/f-a-18f-heavy-air-to-air-load-aim-174s/) taxonomically distinguishes it from Y-prefixed prototypes and X-prefixed experimental deployments. The C prefix means it's the captive (training dummy) version of a production missile.\n\n>The main point is that the F-15EX probably isn't able to carry and fire the missile.\n\nAgreed, although we must admit this is speculative. There would certainly be a lot of software work to integrate the SM-6 into the F-15's datalink / guidance systems, which are obviously different from the Navy's Super Hornets, but (to my admittedly thin knowledge on all this) I don't know that there's an outright incompatibility that would make this impossible.",
         "I definitely understand that, but the US has a habit of saving the best for ourselves. I would be highly surprised if we didn't have air to air capability touching on 200+ miles, we definitely do for certain platforms and applications (JASM-ER for example).\n\nPlus we already know the infosec issues with war thunder forums, and while most of the breaches on there were for classified info, they weren't really all too consequential of breaches IIRC. \n\nWe're talking air-to-air missiles, something I'm sure are a highly guarded secret, where only a select group of people know the true range (maybe not even the pilots themselves). It's simple to code in switches in tech to make sure the full features are walled off until someone gives the go-ahead. \n\nHowever, you're absolutely right on your original point. Focusing on publicly available knowledge is best, since it's all just idle speculation. I'll defer to you on this.",
         "Didn't claim it did. Just that our Eurocanard flying friends have enviable range with their neat-o cool guy throttling missiles. \n\nAlso, don't forget the AIM-260. According to Wikipedia, it's on schedule and expecting a \"some time in 2024\" production with a published range of 120 miles. It's F-35 compatible. \n\nWe also have the AIM-174B, fired from Super Hornets, with a published range of \"*at least* 130 miles.\"\n\nI'd say between these, we're doing just great against the Su-57.",
         "What jet gives the aim 174b a ride is irrelevant.  It's the capabilities of the missile and the f35 that make this possible. You're hung up on the least important detail",
         "Nah, they call it,  \u201cwe straight up stole the f35 designs\u201d35",
         "The drone market would like a word",
         "I am just saying that this talk about \"Chinese can only copy\" is similar to the pre-WW2 sentiment in USA and UK. This has caused many pilots to enter combat with superiority complex, fully confident in their own skills and machines. This has cost them their lives. Yes, maybe J20 is not great. But it is also possible that industrial espionage combined with domestic research allowed Chinese to build true state of the art fighter. Be prepared. Stay vigilant.",
         "I've addressed the AIM-174 and AIM-260 in another reply. The gist of it, is that the former is currently used by the US Navy, and the latter almost certainly isn't meeting the 2024 production claim.\n\nAs such, the capability of F-35 guiding missiles from F-15EX at targets hundreds of miles away, probably currently doesn't exist. It might become true in the next few years, but not as of right now.",
         "No I'm not, because the claim isn't \"F-35 can guide missiles\"; the claim is \"F-35 guiding missiles fired by F-15EX at targets hundreds of miles away\". I'm saying that it can't do that, because there isn't a missile available to the F-15EX with enough range to make it happen. And AFAIK, that is true."

Their ideal strategic position to be in, is one where the world knows they could ramp up and get a nuke with a month or twos work, but not actually do that work and change the entire regions strategic balance and the chess board.\n\nIran is very aware that if it actually acquires nuclear weapons? If it actually becomes a nuclear power? It changes the entire game in the region, with Saudi Arabia and Turkey both acquiring nuclear weapons very quickly, Israel and the US getting very close to launching full scale campaigns against Iran to try put the genie back in the bottle, and Irans \u201caxis of evil\u201d friends China and Russia walking away from them (because none of the nuclear powers want new nuclear powers to appear. None.)\n\nBut Iran also wants the threat of it **could** get nukes to always be there, because it allows it to use that threat as a deescalation strategy whenever things start to heat up. And it keeps Iran relatively safe from direct interventions (their little exchanges with Israel recently not withstanding). It also lets Iran have the occasional \u201cnuclear deal\u201d or treaties with global powers where it can use the promise of not finishing its nuclear program to get a concessions it wants.\n\nWe know from Western, Russian and Chinese sources (which all largely agree), that Iran is technically at a point now where it is weeks away from having a nuclear device. It has been in this position for most of 2024. They could have half a dozen nuclear weapons by Christmas very easily if they chose to.

You can make some differences, but in general everything moves to the same \"optimal\" format.\n\n2) China is second only to NATO when it comes to avionics. They employ AESA radars, sensor fusion and other advanced techniques for a long time. How well it works - remains to be seen, but in general hardware and software should be rather good. Think about Aliexpress or Temu, these are top of the line websites software wise, same as amazon for example (also think xiaomi, dji, Huawei and so on). So in general China should be able to produce military equipment on same level of sophistication. At least in theory.\n\n3) Achilles heel of Chinas Airforce is not equipment, even if they have NATO equipment, they still have issues with proper pilot training (autonomy) and chain of command.\n\n4) Core advantage of f-35 is its engine. Its a single engine yet it produces one fuck tone of power. That power can when be used to generate electricity and cooling capabilities, and that is the limiting factor of EW, Radars and whatnots. China is definitely behind in this aspect. Which puts its at disadvantage vis-a-vi f-35\n\nSo no technology is not archaic. No it is not just a facade.

Maybe we should do more of it.\n\nTurns out that thing is supporting Ukraine and enforcing sanctions.  Together, these things have turned the Russian military and economy into rotting shells of their former selves.

Let's make it more clear: if your neighbour is set to kill himself, and does burn your house down with him inside, will you then go burn his house down? What would it help?\n\nRather than going down with russia, we would prefer to not go down at all, russia can do whatever they want but their path is set, there is no magic which could help them out of this situation.\n\nOnce you damage your economy, the recovery will take very long, that's why our politcians do not want to go through with war. They know the damage it does to their country and they care, contrary to putin who does not give one single fuck about every russian dying if it means he can enjoy his life on a yacht.\n\nOn the other note, autocrates seem to have broken the code and are actively abusing democratic election cycles around the world to further their agenda, who could blame them for that... But we cannot ignore the fact that they are literally outplaying many much more powerful countries just by the fact that they play the calendar that good, it would probably require some change... our democracies are flawed and it's being used to destabilize us, it will get addressed I'm sure.",

         "I'm probably very principalistic in my views, but the way I see it, any type of attack is an act of war, and should be taken as one and instantly recognized as being in total war with the opposition. There should be a zero tolerance policy on any types of attack, that includes cyber, or disinformation war. There is the problem of determining with 100% accuracy where the attack comes from though, I do see that being a problem. But in principle, this is where I stand, I'm fed up with countries acting like fucking criminals and not being made to stand trial.",

         "The enemy of my enemy is not necessarily my friend.  Sometimes it's just another enemy, or at best somebody we don't really want to embrace.  See how arming the Afghan mujahideen worked out in the long run.  I'll be the first to admit that I don't know a huge amount about the Chechens and their struggle against Russia, but the general impression I've gotten over the years is that they're not going to be great purveyors of Western values either.",

But so far after assassinations on NATO territory, and sabotage, and meddling in election, and everything else, the response was absent.",

The general population can only be informed to a certain point. Of course the populist seems stronger to the general population, that's how it has always worked. Because populists yell/use strong language all the time and make people get emotional to use this for their power, but are they really stronger? We will see\n\nLet's take the article as an example. Russia's actions are actually a weak retaliation to what is the actual destruction of their aerospatial industry. Russia is now outsourcing their inland flights through foreign countries... what is one bomb on an aircraft, which we produce many of every year, compared to that? If anything, trying to bomb covertly an aircraft seems like an admission of weakness from russia to me!\n\nNow let's see what the western side can do, have you witnessed hezbollah's technological equipement explode all simultaneously?

She was a very nice person, and one of the only good people in that entire warehouse. Luckily for me I'm not the piece of shit they kept telling everyone i was, and when i first mentioned liking her in a  text to someone, i was very gentlemanly about it, even when that person asked several lewd questions. She was a good person.\n\nPlus, if you had lived the life I jsut had to live the past year and a half living, you would know it's not just a paranoid delusion either. In fact, i hoped and hopped and hoped it was just a delusion. Even after my mom's credit card got used for fraudulent purchases, and even after they started describing the inside of my house and bedroom to me to try to make me go crazy. I'm not joking. And i'm not the only person they've done it to. They do it to everyone. These fuckers have left a wake of victims in their path, i watched it go on for over a year. For over a fucking year I sat there and watched them do what they did to me to countless other people. The only difference between me and them, is that I figured out what was going on, and started fighting back. And i pushed their fucking shit in for over a year straight. Which then caused hte situation to escalate to where it's at now. Where stupid little15 year old girls are being arrested for making up heinous crimes, and the police have to set up camera sentry devices on my run route now.\n\nAlso, this happened at Amazon BTW. And the management, including hte top one, are all in on it. Either through complacency via threats of blackmail, or directly to profit themselves. Some also just use it to get rid of people they don't like. One guy there even got arrested for arson, and in the news article it said he got caught through cellular data, but knowing what i know now, i'd say that guy didn't do it.

Extended range of use of our weapons would be a measured and appropriate response. You can be a hawk or a dove.

Then you have to file for unemployment and show that you are actively applying for jobs weekly. This process varies by state as does the payout. In 2014 it was about double what you said. Women with children get significantly more help. If you are having trouble filling out the forms get in touch with a social worker and they should be able to help you.

         "> Because it's donkey brained to think that Russia will give away weapons that they need to fund the destruction of Israel.\n\nNot if they estimate that those weapons will draw away more attention from the West elsewhere, or that it will cause Western nations to tire of supporting a war that is escalating to multiple fronts.\n\n>At the expense of their own weapons war and because they predicted that Israel will raze Gaza to the ground?? And it's donkey brained to think Europe would prioritize Israel, who they don't care about, than Ukraine which they do. So which one do you think they care about, their backyard or the donkey brained option?\n\nSending a small amount of armaments will not drastically affect the war. But diverting multiple ships and missiles from the west definitely could. And if the long term goal is to make western nations tire of supporting conflict on multiple fronts, then it's fucking cheap.\n\nIn fact, that's exactly what's been happening. The US has been dragging its feet for a while in terms of aiding Ukraine. Partly because they had to divert more resources to secure shipping lanes next to Yemen and divert support to aid Israel.\n\nSo it's actually working *exactly* like I'm trying to tell you. I'm not making this up, and this is *exactly* what the US has done countless times in Latin America, and the Brits & French have done in Eastern Europe and the Middle East.\n\nAs to your last point EU nations have 100% diverted resources to help secure the shipping channel from the Houthis in Yemen. UK, US, Denmark, and France all have increased the amount of ships sailing in the area and have launched missile strikes.\n\n>You are comparing Russia who has no money, and has one war, with the fucking United States of America who has no war and 2 orders of magnitude more resources.\n\nNo money? Russia has upped it's military budget to levels that put it as the 3rd largest spender. Only China, who is supporting Russia, and the US are ahead of them.\n\nAnd those figures are in raw dollars. Russia gets far more for every $ spent than the US does.\n\nThe cost of arming a small muslim terrorist organization is fucking cheap compared to that. That's why the US, UK, France, Russia, and China have done the exact same thing multiple times in the past.\n\nIt's extremely cheap to cause pain to your enemy this way and to divert their resources and attention across multiple fronts.\n\n>That's moronic. I'm not the one claiming this was a Russia attack. Nobody says that. Everybody agrees this was Iran funded. Everyone agrees Iran greenlit the attack. Only morons say Russia is behind it. Which are you?\n\nNobody is saying it was a Russian or Iranian attack. They're saying that Russia and Iran are both funding Islamic terror groups and other groups in Africa to sow havoc and divert attention away from Ukraine.\n\nIran suddenly ramping up their efforts after the war in Ukraine is absolutely not a coincidence.\n\n>Who? Who said Russia greenlit the attack? Which reports. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAH \n\nWhat attack? I'm talking about generally supporting musim terror groups. Whether they are part of planning the minute details I can't say, but they sure as shit are encouraging them to create problems.\n\nAnd who's saying it? US, EU, and Israeli intelligence, that's who.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/25/us/politics/russia-houthis-weapons.html\n\nhttps://foreignpolicy.com/2024/10/22/russia-arms-dealer-viktor-bout-houthis-red-sea-yemen/\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-brokering-talks-send-advanced-russian-missiles-yemens-houthis-sources-say-2024-09-24/\n\nhttps://www.middleeasteye.net/news/exclusive-russian-military-advising-houthis-inside-yemen-us-intelligence-suggests",
