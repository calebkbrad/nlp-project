         "I think we have nothing to lose at this point by letting Ukr go ham with western weapons.",
         "I say let Ukraine go wild! Now's the time.",
         "Biden needs to give them the green light to do whatever for the next two months because after that, Putin\u2019s lapdog is back at the helm.",
         "Hitting Russia where it hurts, going after Russian military facilities....",
         "Ukraine knows they wont get any more support so who cares anymore?\n\n\nThey probably have to use their missiles before trump delivers first patriots to russia",
         "Fuck it. Go all out. You\u2019ve got two months.",
         "They better unleash everything they've got now because in a couple of months that orange fuck is going to have his boot on their throat",
         "Do what you can, only 60 days till the US betrays you (aka MAGA/Putins puppet)",
         "Oh if I\u2019m Ukraine I hit any target I can. After inauguration they\u2019re well and truly fucked. Sorry guys, some of us really did try.",
         "Good luck Ukraine, you've got about two months left to win this war...the clock is ticking.",
         "Ukraine Taiwan and others will need nuclear weapons",
         "well that war is going to be over tomorrow. thank you mr convict president.",
         "Ukraine, you need to go all in right now.",
         "Ukraine needs to use whatever arms it has gotten and strike whatever it can in Russia. The US isn\u2019t sending anything else after January. They need to fight for their lives.",
         "Biden, give Ukraine every possible weapon they could think of, and let them go crazy on Russia in these last three months of the presidency \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffb",
         "Might as well. The US will be funding Russia soon.",
         "Lame duck some weapons right now",
         "Ukraine may have advanced as deep as 25KM according to russian sources.\n\nSudzha is getting the Vovchansk treatment.\n\nAt this rate of advance, the Kursk nuclear power plant will come under threat in the coming days and the city of Kursk itself could come under threat.\n\nSo far, these are the most well-planned and executed maneuvers of the AFU since the 2022 Kharkiv counteroffensive, and russia had no idea this was coming. Ukraine kept this under wraps really well.",
         "Just let loose. You have until January.",
         "Ukraine is going to hit as hard as possible right before Trump demands they surrender.",
         "Since he has nothing to lose at this point, biden should allow Ukraine to take the gloves off and send even more support",
         "Ukraine better use whatever they have however they want because they just lost any future help.",
         "I was thinking last night, they have obviously considered this possibility, which means they have plans for how to react. I figure the next few months will have much more aggressive action taken in Russian territory.\u00a0",
         "Go rouge and do your worst Ukraine. Your days are numbered anyway. Nothing left to lose. This could get interesting.",
         "I think a lot of us are underestimating ukrainian resolve. Ukraine will adopt their own weapons program and do it relatively quickly. This is far from  over.",
         "Ukraine has 61 days to take out Moscow.",
         "At this point Ukraine has permission to go all out. Rules of war were thrown out the window long ago. Attack Moscow. Bomb cities. Who gives a shit? Fuck Russia up",
         "GET EM BOYS!",
         "Is that Russia they've hit or the US? I can't tell since they are now one and the same",
         "Biden, send them all we can muster.",
         "Will Khabib fight to defend?",
         "Better get while the getting is good I guess.",
         "Now is the time, Ukraine. Trump will not help you.",
         "There still all the allies I like to believe will continue support",
         "Ukraine needs to end this war before trump takes office",
         "Ukraine has stopped jungling",
         "Good luck, Ukraine.\n\nWe\u2019re sorry. We tried.",
         "Got two months before putin\u2019s lap dog cuts them off. Better do everything they can now",
         "Fucking send it. Russia gets the all clear in 2 months",
         "Godspeed Ukraine. I hope you pull a miracle out of your hat.",
         "Good.  I really hope the west let's them do whatever they like before Trump abandons them",
         "Biden should let them go full frontal assault before Trump pulls the plug.",
         "Final stand",
         "Time for the US to send 200 F35s, 10 B52s, 2000 Abrams, 100 Apaches and like 20% of whatever AA we've got lying in storage still. And an unholy amount of munitions to fuel them.\n\nMake Moscow BURN.",
         "Ukraine basically has a 2 month deadline to get into a dominant, self-sustaining position. I pray that Biden and co can get them as much support for these 2 months as possible. \n\nEurope, it's time to get in there, because we failed again.",
         "Go full in\u2026 no one is helping anymore..",
         "Let em all off the chain. Go big.",
         "Yep, time to get this show on the road before the Orange smear shifts the resources to Russia.",
         "Go go go Ukraine fuck their shit up! US Gov has fucked you as an ally. Proceed however you feel is correct to win your freedom. We will be doing that here in the states these next four years.",
         "They need to do as much as possible asap",
         "You guys have a few months until Trump is in office. Make it count. We tried. I'm sorry.",
         "They need to hit as much as they can before Trump removes funding from them and NATO",
         "Ukraine has between now and Jan 20 to ignore Biden and rain down every weapon they have on Putin\u2019s ass.",
         "It's now or never, American support will stop in 2025. I hope they rain hell all over russia for the next 2 months",
         "I say fuck it, and attack everywhere in Russia. They have nothing to lose at this point.",
         "Well if I was Ukraine I would hit every target that I knew about. There probably aren't going to be more weapons from America.",
         "We're about to see Ukraine unleash everything without holding back. \n\nEveryone knows Trump is going to hand Ukraine over to Putin the moment he can.",
         "One good piece of news.",
         "Good. Cook them mfers",
         "Send it Ukraine, we as Americans are imminently about to fail you, do what you can, do it violently, and do it fast.",
         "Give Ukraine 2 1/2 months of open war. Trump hasn\u2019t been attending the meetings for transfer of power so it\u2019s not like it really matters. Ukraine will likely lose their US financing so let them have a chance to posture.",
         "At this point, we should stop holding Ukraine back.",
         "Pulling out all the stops before the US stops shipping weapons.",
         "It's time to go wild man, Slava Ukraine",
         "They should do as much damage as they can now because they're fucked come January.",
         "Could Biden by executive order give a shit ton of weapons to Ukraine, without the house and senate?\n\nLike here are:  \n500 Abrams  \n20 Patriot Systems  \n50 HIMARS + 10.000 GMLRS, 500 ATACMS etc.  \n500 Bradly  \n1,000,000 155mm  \netc.",
         "Fuck em up while you can. Pedal to the metal. Slava Ukraine.",
         "Bomb everything.  Trump is not going to help after last night and impeachment",
         "I hope Ukraine goes full tilt on Russia until they can't do it any more. Fuck it, they literally have nothing to lose at this point. Once Trump is sworn in Russia will get the green light to take whatever they want in Europe.",
         "I feel bad for Ukraine on this day Trump the Russian puppet is going to do Putins wishes. Hopefully the rest of the west can help",
         "If Ukraine was smart they\u2019d just target Moscow today",
         "I'm guessing BIden was telling Ukraine to hold back with the election coming up, but now they lost and it's trump they will be dealing with in a few months, gloves are off.",
         "Ukraine \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6 do all that you can, baby! I love you forever and always. You know what's coming in 2025. Move fast and don't hold back.",
         "Ukraine has two choices.\n\n1. Go ham and fight like hell with no holding back.\n\n2. Surrender to save lives, and have their president go hide in the UK or something. (But Russia has assassinated people on foreign soil so there is that.)\n\nZelenskyy will probably be dead before 2028",
         "They wrestle bears\u2026 they should pick a different region",
         "Do it Ukraine ramp it up",
         "What Ukraine should have been doing from the beginning. You're defending your country, who gives a fuck what anyone else says when they won't actually show up and help anyway. Want something done? Do it yourself.",
         "Ukraine needs to build a few nukes asap",
         "Good. Biden should tell them to unleash everything they possibly have, Ukraine needs to get wild with it, hit anything that Russia owns that they can in the time between now and Jan. 20. We should send them everything we own and tell them to let it rip. If we can hand over some nukes, let\u2019s do it. Make it so Russia is demolished before Trump can even begin to think about handing over our resources to them.",
         "That's by the Caspian Sea.",
         "go hard now",
         "Ukraine has less than 2 months to end this, that's how they should think.",
         "No reason to wait.",
         "Ukraine doesn't have much time left now. I'd say it's about time they go on the full offensive.",
         "Go crazy with the weapons, because im worried trump will cut them off if you dont surrender land to russia",
         "Send them everything we have right now",
         "Biden needs to immediately tell Ukraine to unleash. They have a couple of months before the next admin actively works to undermine them, at which point it will be fully on Europe to support them\u2026 if not eventually even directly engaging.",
         "Biden needs to let Ukraine off the leash while he can, use that \"official acts\" power to the fullest.  Can he authorize giving them nukes?",
         "Ukraine\u2019s best chance is launch a major offensive on Moscow before trump is sworn in. Biden needs to green light them to strike Russia with their weapons before he leaves office",
         "Oh shit, they're going to piss off the wrestlers.",
         "I'm sorry on behalf of our country that we let yours down, Ukraine. For what it's worth some of us are still rooting for you.",
         "my pro-russian ukranian friends are happy about the elections",
         "Why hit a Caspian sea navy base?",
         "There won't be any help from America soon so Ukraine needs to go all out and blow up as much Russian war weapons as possible until january.",
         "Well they have around 2 months to sort things out.",
         "They better hope they can wrestle",
         "Zelensky, if you can hear this: Shell Moscow",
         "At this point Ukraine has to see the writing on the wall. Time to take the gloves off.",
         "Might as well. They should just start bombin Moscow",
         "If they're gonna do it they should do it now.",
         "Ukraine doing a 2 minute drill.",
         "What good does hitting a naval base on the Caspian Sea do? ELI5",
         "End the war!",
         "Hope Biden eliminates the restrictions on long range weapons",
         "Not getting any more support from the morons across the Atlantic.",
         "Give them hell, Ukrainian. I hope Canada can help you as much as possible because the USA failed you last night.",
         "Dagestan sounds like an arma island",
         "\"Fuck it, boys. Smoke 'em if you got 'em.\"\n\n\n-- Zelensky, probably",
         "Congratulations Ukraine. Enjoy these battlefield gains while you can. Not sure you're going to receive anything from the U.S. over these next 4 years. I really hope you win, meaning regain Crimea and push Russia back from all occupied Ukraine areas. Maybe you'll get those F-16s before January 2025.",
         "Ukraine needs to get going before it\u2019s leveled.",
         "If Biden doesn\u2019t give everything to Ukraine to win in the next months then he deserves his new legacy",
         "Hit them hard and with everything you got!",
         "They absolutely need to speed the war up at this point.",
         "Biden should just hand over as much ammo and material as possible to Poland and they can hand it to Ukraine because after January 20th I don't think they'll get anymore.",
         "Shiiiet... Now Khabib is gonna join the fight... Ukraine is a TKO",
         "Fun fact Dagestan is actually a MMA powerhouse that is home to like 12 active UFC fighters. Hoping these wars can be brought to an end. There are wonderful and talented civilians on both sides suffering.",
         "Everyone is saying it\u2019s over\u2026why isn\u2019t there extreme pressure on the EU to do what they promised?\n\nBecause the USA pulls out, it\u2019s acceptable for the EU to pull out as well?\n\nMust be nice to never have to accept responsibility and never lead the charge on anything.",
         "If I were Ukraine I'd use them however they want.  They're getting cut off anyway, why care what we think",
         "I predict that Zelenskyy has just given the go ahead for restarting the Ukrainian nuclear weapons program.",
         "Absolutely.\n\nI would send them everything asap with the expectation that support stops as soon as Trump becomes President.\n\nIt's on Europe now to stop Putin.",
         "UA will likely consider themselves freed from any constraints anyway at least until Jan 2025. Lame duck presidency, deliveries at 10%<, only condemnations from the WH.",
         "Gloves off is the only thing they have left.",
         "Yup. Biden should let loose on restrictions",
         "Exactly. Come January, Trump will give Putin the keys to the Ukraine (and probably the US nuke suitcase).",
         "If Biden doesn't allow this immediately he is just as big of a turd as the felon elect.",
         "I'd advise they look into making a nuclear weapon, at least some prototype. They have the skill, knowledge and experience, will maybe get one up and working before the handover.\n\nWe now see how fickle the nuclear umbrella is, so time for everyone to arm up, or lube up.",
         "Except a large retaliation against Ukrainian people by the Russian military. I want Russia to lose, but with the least amount of lives lost as possible",
         "Personally, I think Joe should give them some nukes.",
         "I came here to say exactly the same. Let \u2018er rip.",
         "This. Unleash hell.",
         "biden is weak. he wont do it.",
         "Yeah, unfortunately Ukraine has about 120 days before the US switches its support to Russia. Fucking sad man.",
         "Yeah, nothing but ww3, but that wouldn't be so bad, right?",
         "They should just go balls out into Ukraine and end it all before jackass takes into office",
         "This is exactly what I came in to say, they have nothing to lose now. Keeping in our good graces is no longer possible. Use the missiles wherever.",
         "Go off queens",
         "Yuuuuup. Open it up. Right now. Give them LR, and Heavies. Stop this now, so Russians are unable to make moves in 3 months.",
         "Yup, have at it. Now that Republicans are in control they are going to deny funding, Putin will take Ukraine and then Belarus and we will then transition to WIII.",
         "Do you think ukranian are conducting this kind of operation? You are delusional",
         "Seriously, let them defend the shit out of themselves while they can. Start lobbing into Moscow directly.",
         "Pretty sure Dagestan is where the Boston Marathon bombers are from (or trained) on top of it is the airport that was stormed by terrorists looking for Jews last year\n\nThat city has problems",
         "Give them some nukes too.",
         "Yup, Light em all off as far as they can go. Shell fucking Moscow. Let's get this motherfucker started!!",
         "ukraine probably figures it has nothing to lose just doing it without permission now",
         "Especially when they\u2019re used against the region of Russia that stormed and occupied an entire airport all so that they could lynch Jews on a flight returning from Israel\u00a0",
         "Yep.  Send 'em massive stockpiles and tell 'em \"Use 'em how you want\"\n\nWhat's going to happen if he does?  Oh, that's right, we already know Trump is going to screw over Ukraine.",
         "Yeah only escalation leading to total nuclear annihilation, jeez",
         "Except potentially Ww3 and a nuclear holocaust, yeah nothing to lose",
         "They\u2019ve got nothing left to lose, either.",
         "Trump will probably start sending weapons to Russia soon",
         "Other than open war?",
         "nuclear war?",
         "No thank you,I would prefer to not have WW3 and get even more innocent countries involved. But you can go fight in Ukraine all you want if you feel like it, absolutely nobody is stopping you.",
         "You want to hurry to start WW3 before Trump gets in office?",
         "If you really think that there's nothing left to lose you have little concept of just how bad things can still get. This escalation is wild considering the timing. Zelenskyy isn't gonna be the one that brings peace, that I'm now convinced of.",
         "Biden should give them 4 years worth of supplies in his last 2 months",
         "Now\u2019s the time? Not 2 fucking years ago?",
         "Not just Biden: everyone in Europe too. Let's let Ukraine go ham on Russia and make it eat shit. If Ukrainechas to go down then be it as if it was forced to swallow a fucking porcupine.",
         "Unironically this, ukraine has more to worry about then pulling of funding. It is a distinct possibility trump directly starts to fund Russian coffers and maybe even send boots on ground against Ukraine. The US is officially a Russian vassal state now.",
         "Won't get any more support?\n\nAre you one of the uninformed suckers that believed the whole vote spiel that the US was the only provider of aid?",
         "Launch non stop drones at the Kremlin until something hits it. Hail Mary. Might as well try to eliminate Trump's master",
         "I\u2019m paying taxes and I support fucking up Russia.",
         "Yeah I hope Ukraine will go at Russia like if this is 1915 at the front between France and Germany. Just 24/7 shelling with everything they have.",
         "[removed]",
         "[removed]",
         "God Speed",
         "Not entirely true. Yes the infrastructure and manufacturing could get worse then it is but if the war on terror taught me anything it's that you shouldn't disregard a people's resolve.",
         "Taiwan would have had nuclear weapons too, if it wasn't for the US shutting the nuclear program down only to show that they're incredibly unreliable allies.  :/",
         "[deleted]",
         "It\u2019ll be over once he\u2019s in office, which is a couple months away. Ukraine should hurl everything they have at Russia until then.",
         "its so weird, i see Trump fans on TV/youtube, but don't personally know anyone that likes him or voted for him.  Feels sureal.",
         "Trump doesn\u2019t take power tomorrow.",
         "I was waiting for this comment.",
         "Source?  Last I'd heard they were still holding in place in Kursk and reluctantly giving ground under the main Russian thrust.  I'd love to be proven wrong though!",
         "I feel like bombing cities would backfire on Ukraine.",
         "Sound nice but more and more looks like mericans rather see old hardware rust and rot in desert than put it back to use to help save coutry and lives.",
         "Europe has been in there since the very beginning. Not only have the EU and the individual members as well as the UK donated billions, but they have welcomed over 4 million Ukrainian refugees. They are freely given access to housing,medical care, welfare benefits , schools for the children and given the right to work. How much is that worth?  Let\u2019s say $ 1,000 per person per month\u2026 That\u2019s an ongoing cost of more than $4 billion per month\u2026 and we\u2019re not banging our own drum and telling the rest of the world how great we are. \n \n\nHow much is the USA giving",
         "Yeah as if Russia is going to survive five minutes against NATO even without the mighty USA.",
         "It was there.",
         "Not really.  Who's to say they won't have the ability to keep hitting the oligarchs after 2 months?  Will tRump wave a magic cheeseburger to get them to stop?  Just less and less US aid.",
         "Firstly, any damage you can do to the enemy will cost the enemy in various ways - financially, public perception, resources, personell.\n\nSecondly, there is a limited shipping route from the Caspian into the Azov and Black seas via the Volga River, the Don River and the Volga-Don shipping canal.",
         "why not directly to ukraine? what's your reasoning?",
         "dagestan is just a general powerhouse in any grappling sport. sambo wrestling and mma they all do phenomonal in. MMA in dagestan is only really elite if it's from Abdulmanap's old gym (Khabib's current) and in that very close circle. So right now it's mainly khabib/islam/umar/usman (all but islam related). Of course Belal and a few others join in or have their camp there but those 4 are the only ones that train in dagestan largely.",
         "  1.  US pulling support drastically reduces the total support available\n  2. Weapons EU can supply are largely US made or include US components, and US can likely veto thier use **entirely**, as we see now they veto in only long range weapon use\n  3.  It's Trump, who idolises Putin, frankly I wouldn't put it past him to not just withdraw support, but to switch sides",
         "Why isn't there extreme pressure on the USA to do what they promised when UA give away nuclear program in Budapest Memorandum?",
         "Sorta hoping Biden stocks them the fuck up for a decade before he peaces out of the White House.",
         "Not too sure on this but I think some of the weapons are geo fenced to Ukraine.",
         "Cut off from the uS maybe but they haven't been sitting idly by. They still have the EU and Canada who have signed agreements with them to continue support so unless they reneg it might be a bit more of a struggle but it wasn't just the US. \n\nSo begins the reduction in US foreign influence...",
         "I might be completely wrong but they might be afraid of losing support from western countries if they attack however and wherever they like, which would be a death sentence",
         "If I were Ukraine I\u2019d use them anyway I want without regard at this point.\n\nPeople forget part of the reason Trump got impeached the first time was because he tried to withhold aid from Ukraine unless they gave up dirt on Biden.\n\nUkraine needs to just prepare for one last ditch mass forward advance before the country begins collapsing.\n\nEdit: idk if that will come in two months or two hundred, but that\u2019s how I see this playing out, eventually Ukraine will get burnt out, try to battle of the bulge it, and then start slowly collapsing to Kyiv\n\nEdit 2: as I wrote that I realized that is what is currently happening with Ukraine incursion into Kursk while Donetsk is falling\u2026 fuck",
         "Launch codes?",
         "Good point.  I do hope Biden just unloads everything he can before leaving office and says \u201cbe sure not to go to deep into Russia with these\u201d wink wink.  And while he\u2019s at it just forgive all student loans.  Go scorched earth.  It can be Dems own little J6 rebellion.",
         "Exactly. That's what I would do.\u00a0",
         "if you were ukraine the whole nation would be lost. so thank fuck you are just some random redditor talking out their ass like always",
         "This should've happened right from the start.",
         "In the best of scenarios this would take a lot of money and time (not to mention you need the right people for this), how do you figure they can start a nuclear weapons program in the middle of a total war? Even if by some miracle they could, Russia would bomb the shit out of every facility, if not outright nuke it.",
         "If Kushner got a few billion for nuclear secrets to SA, surely we could work a deal for Ukraine.",
         "Are they a threshold state?",
         "Good. I hope they fuck up the russians like we are too chicken shit to do.",
         "I think there could be a workaround for that. They don't need their own nuclear weapons program. It would be enough if they shared know-how with Poland and we shared complete nukes in exchange.",
         "It won\u2019t take long. 6 months for a working device at most.",
         "This war has precisely shown that nuclear weapons are useless. Just like Russia threats of nuclear escalation aren't believed, Ukraine would have been invaded the same if it had nuclear weapons.",
         "Biden could go ahead and do it then use that bullshit immunity to excuse himself.",
         "Plus the threat of halting future weapons deliveries is moot, as that will happen anyway",
         "He should've announced he wasn't seeking re-election and let the Dems hold a proper primary before the national convention. Then they could've figured out which candidate had the best shot of beating Trump instead of pulling a last minute substitution out of their ass. Biden shares a large part of the blame for what happened last night.",
         "Biden, the Democratic Party has so responsibility in preventing better odds at getting a democrat elected. Biden should have stepped down way earlier, his handlers/ media shouldn\u2019t have gas lit people for so long. Then instead of having a plan, they force Biden to step down.. with little time to prepare. Putting an unpopular VP to run for President was SO stupid. Harris vote numbers were below Biden\u2019s in almost every county.. or maybe it was legit every single county. Biden could have green lit long range strikes way earlier, at the least not prevent other countries weapons (with US components) from striking deep\u2026 I mean least that gives you some plausible deniability. Jake Sullivan is terrible for Ukraine.. hope they flood UA now, the US military has the ability to transport so until Jan 6th.

I don\u2019t see Trump shutting all that down. Hell, we don\u2019t know with Trump, he\u2019s a way bigger threat to us Americans bc he may get another SCJ, but the military isn\u2019t going allow slippage.

A win for everyone.\n\nUntil Russia decided that it wanted Ukraine back under Russian control.\n\nThe US was then forced to try to defend Ukraine, as promised, as best it could, without starting a full on, all out war, with Russia.\n\nNOT supporting Ukraine would mean that the US was not a true ally, but was a country that would make promises to get what it wanted, and then would refuse to keep those promises when the time came to actually fulfill what they promised.  How many allies does anyone think that the US would have if it did shit like that?\n\nOne of the problems with Trump is that he is and always has been a very transactional person.  If you can do for him, he likes you and will help.  If you are no use to him, he will cut you loose and let you live or die on your own, regardless of any promises that were made.\n\nThis was abundantly clear when he tried to blackmail/extort Zelensky and Ukraine for dirt on a political opponent when he was in office the first time, and for which he was Impeached the first time.\n\nZelensky and Ukraine have nothing that Trump wants this time. Trump has made it clear time and time again over the past 4 years that Ukraine and Russia need to resolve this themselves, without the help of the US, regardless of any promise that was made to Ukraine to help them defend themselves.\n\nHe is perfectly willing to have the US destroy and go back on promises that were made because Trump will personally get nothing from helping.\n\nTrump promised to support and pay for the defense of his own supporters if they fought for him and got in legal trouble. They tried, and failed. And once they failed, they were no longer of any use for him, so he went back on his word/promise.\n\nWhile he could not pardon any of the Jan 6th idiots since none had been convicted of any crimes before he left office the first time, but he COULD have spent part of the past 4 years helping to raise money for lawyers for them. He didn't.  The transaction was over. They were no longer any use for him. They would have to \"live or die\" on their own.\n\nWith Trump winning again, Ukraine has to face the very real possibility that the US will demand that Zelensky negotiate some type of peace agreement with Russia or have all aid from the US cut off.\n\nWhile peace IS the ultimate goal, without the support of the US, Ukraine has very diminished negotiating power and Russia can ask for anything and everything it wants, up to and including complete surrender and dismantling of the entire Ukraine independent government and full re-annexation of the entire region back under Russia control.\n\nTrump HATES NATO because the US is the largest contributor to NATO and Trump believes that all of the other NATO countries should not solely rely on the US for assistance and defense.\n\nDoes anyone really think NATO allies are going to be willing to stand in defense of Ukraine if Trump pulls all support for them?  The way Trump is, he would retaliate against our NATO allies by pulling support again for NATO and refusing to spend any more money or resources towards NATO and any NATO allies.",

I guess what I would want to clear up is in definitions of words:\n\n- when you say \"fissile material\", it sounds like you mean \"sufficiently enriched fissile material\".  I was more meaning it in the sense that viable uranium ore is not present in every country, and getting a supply chain requires either having domestic production available, or having enough global sway to get it.  Clearly, Ukraine already has uranium.\n\n- I suppose I'm not 100% clear what the exact cutoff is for a \"threshold state\".  I fear that my comment was taken to mean I think Ukraine is months, rather than years from being able to develop a weapon.  What I meant, with the caveat of all the things I might not know, was more along the lines that Ukraine is years, not decades away.  Would you agree or disagree with this latter statement?\n\n>Ukraine nuking Russia is how WW3 starts\n\nAgreed, but as with any country, the point of a nuke is not to use it -- it's a bargaining chip and a deterrent.\n\n>I highly doubt anyone would be willing to sell \n\nI wouldn't 100% rule it out.  Honestly, in spite of his connection with Putin, I ironically could see Trump selling Ukraine nukes for the right price.  \n\n>Ukraine doesn't have the time, money or material to develop nuclear weapons and\n\nI am also sort of conflating this with another comment chain, which I see you also replied to me on, where someone said Ukraine could take advantage of a several-year ceasefire to develop nukes as a deterrent.  I agree that, in a wartime footing, they do not have the resources to spare for a from-scratch weapons program.  I'm more interested in the question of what they could do with several years of uneasy peace.  I have a couple more questions:\n\n- your other comment heavily emphasized fast breeder reactors, but these aren't completely necessary for weapons, are they?  Isn't enrichment to weapons-grade possible with centrifuges alone?\n\n- I do leave myself open to the argument that other nations could cut off Ukraine's supply of uranium if they detected weapons-development activities (and they would detect it.  That's where we're juuuust starting to overlap with things I *am* an expert in).  My question is, couldn't they get the necessary fissile material from nuclear waste, which I assume they have plenty of?\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nThis comment is already long, so there's no harm in making it longer by one end note.  I know I may come across as argumentative when I also clearly have plenty to learn on this topic.  That's really just part of my learning style, and I am listening to what you say, but I also have to address it when I hear a detail that doesn't sound quite right -- if anything, it means I'll be paying extra attention if you do counter me on that detail I disagreed with",

Even if that means a confrontation with the west - which would be a purely military affair. This would pose an existential threat to Putin and Co and the core of the Russian state.

         "I feel for my eatern neighbours, but... yeah. No\n\nFive will get you ten: Putin will make an outrageous peace deal proposal, that includes handing over Zelensky to be tried, Ukraine paying 3 quintillion dollars in reparations, Putin's designated man becomes the capo of Ukraine, occupation by russian army, and Russian becomes the state language of Ukraine. And then in comes Trump, and \"negotiates\" it down to Ukraine just ceding the Donbass and Crimea, Ukraine paying significant, but smaller reparations than demanded, and Ukraine promises to sign no trade deals with the EU. Take it or leave it. The exact terms have probably already been agreed.\n\nPutin is the great conqueror, Trump is the great deal-maker, dumbfucks think this is a \"victory for peace\"",

         "Honestly, I see Trump going one of two ways with this.\n\n1: Pulling put all US support/threatening to do so unless a peace treaty is signed, likely not in Ukraine favor. Goal here is like Biden in Afghanistan. Get credit for ending US involvement, damn the consequences. \n\n2: Remove restrictions on Ukraine, and let them get more aggressive aid and support. Stuff that would be considered too risky under Biden, gets full steam ahead. Using an excuse to create a no fly zone. Giving Ukraine long range cruise missiles to blow up Russia's entire oil infrastructure. Etc. Like option one, the main goal is to pit pressure on one party to sign a peace treaty. This time, Russia getting the pressure. \n\nTrump is an emotional politician. He doesn't care about Russia or Ukraine. Only what fame he can get from ending the war.",

That's probably why Russia's public response has been muted, they don't necessarily believe that Russia is going to get what they want (and what they want is a lot more than what they currently occupy in Ukraine).\n\nFrom some analysts that I've seen, Ukraine is happy in the short term to give up territory if it means that they can get security guarantees, such as joining NATO, so that they can't get invaded again. Any territory loses would only be seen as temporary. If Trump is serious about peace, then it may be good for Ukraine if it involves joining NATO, but we will see.",

         "The EU often struggles to take decisive action. As a union of 27 countries, each with its own national interests, reaching unanimous agreement on significant issues is challenging. The decisions made by the EU Parliament and Commission often focus on relatively minor matters rather than major, impactful policies.",
         "\"Haha we're in danger....\"\n\n  \n\\- Europeans",
         "To be honest, it\u2019s about time that the EU stepped up its military spending and built its own deterrent (read: nuclear arsenal capable of MAD whether it\u2019s through submarines, ICBM\u2019s, or whatever other means). The direction of US politics basically means that we\u2019re no longer a reliable ally and, honestly, should even be seen as a potential future adversary if things keep going the way they\u2019re going.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult because unlike the USA, China, or Russia, the EU is a collection of independent nations rather than a single country, but for Europe\u2019s sake I do hope they get it together for their collective good. Sad to say this, but this is the world we\u2019re living in and military capabilities take a long time to build so the sooner they do it, the better.",
         "To put it in perspective, it's like having 27 different 'USAs' together, each with its own language, distinct history, and sometimes even a separate currency. Foreign policy can also vary from one member to another. The system barely functions as a unified entity. Its biggest achievements are free trade between members and the elimination of borders.",
         "And nukes - I am afraid in this reality everyone needs nukes.  Insane rules for an insane world.\n\nYou think Russia won't use Tac nukes with Trump at the helm?",

It goes nuclear before Putin pushes his troops 48-72 hours into the Baltics. \n\nThings can change of course, but while both sides are nuclear armed and one is much *much* more conventionally powerful than the other, it doesn't end in anything but annihilation.",
         "Take a look at Russia for a shining example of how useful a conscripted army is\u2026",
         "So basically like the US then lol",
         "NATO has never required any countries to spend a certain amount on defence.\n\nBTW remember that the USA is a member of a number of defence pacts so its defence budget is not just for NATO.  In addition  military health care, housing, pensions and education is often part of the national budget and not earmarked as defence spending in NATO countries. IIUC those are counted as military spending in the USA.",
         "The EU is not a union of 27 countries. Each member state retains its own sovereignty. The EU\u2019s mandate is limited to basically the freedom of trade, goods, workers and capital. It does not have a mandate for defence. I suggest that you read the Treaty of Rome for a better understanding of the basics. Of course, it has since been superseded by the treaties establishing the EU but they\u2019re a bit of a long read\u2026",

         "Draft to clean up fallout, farm, and rebuild basic infrastructure, sure.",
         "a lot of EU militaries have been neglected for an extended period of time, it's not an easy switch to flip as it would take a lot of money to get officers, infrastructure and only then does more serious recruitment become feasible, or else you will have people carrying antique equipment or digging ditches with short shovels.",
         "EU has 2 million troops with way better gear than Russia. They just don't have lots of force projections stuff like fields of tanks, but their air force would rule Russia from the sky fairly easily even if they had to be careful at first while taking out the air defense. \n\nEU also has 500 million people and a 20 trililon GDP right up there with the US. Russia has a 2 trillion GDP economy and 150 million people. \n\nThe 2 million troops and much better gear is easily enough to hold Russia at bay while they ramp up production with nearly 10 times the GDP as Russia. \n\nThe world got used to the USSR being a threat and just assumed they had comparable power to back in the day, but they don't anything comparable in any sector of military other than the meat bltiz. They are very good at that compared to the EU.\n\nThere is no plausible reality that Russia could do anything but get their ass kicked by the EU and that's not new, that's been the reality for a couple decades because Russia has barely improved their military since the USSR days.",
         "They have a federal government and military, we don\u2019t.",
         "It's been a while since I checked but I think only 3 out of the 27 countries pay what is required, and France pays like 3x what they are required. I remember a few years ago the French Army General at the time was telling the EU that as long as they refused to pay their dues, provide troops, and expected America to step in and take care of things for them, they didn't get to complain when America didn't handle things they way they wanted.",
         "\"The dream of the 1890s are alive in Moscow!\"",
         "That\u2019s always assumed, but no one was able to convincingly explain to me why they would. No one of import turned their back on the US when it used the bomb two times. No one allied with Russia would turn their back on them. Stern words maybe, but nothing more. If they were afraid of looking bad or were spooked, they would have already distanced themselves in light of all the war crimes committed by Russia.\n\nI also don\u2019t believe the west would enter the war. They maybe would lift restrictions, sanction more, and deliver more, but that\u2019s it. No one will go to war over Ukraine. That\u2019s just reality.",
         "You are aware that we have allies that are not in NATO, such as Japan and SK?",
         "Yeah guess those two world wars where the US saved Europe's ass just never happened then.",
         "Which is bizarre because we took basically zero action when Putin invaded Crimea.",
         "I feel like he was being totally reasonable there has to be some accountability for countries not fulfilling their obligations.  The point of NATO isn't to let countries stop spending on military knowing the US would make up the difference.  I have no idea why previous presidents didn't make that a bigger issue or threaten anything over it because the status quo was bad for everyone not just the US.",
         "You seemed to be angry when Trump is bargaining for USA.  Where is the check and balance to your allies?  Do you have to please them all the time?",
         "Yep .. I remember Obama giving David Cameron a lecture when the UK tried to sneak anti terrorist policing into the defence budget and account for it as being spend set aside their 2% NATO obligation (the idea was humanely suffocated)",
         "Na he can get all the credit he wants for that. Europe relies on the US while sticking their nose up in the air and acting superior and still falling behind and being stagnant economically relative to China. In real terms they\u2019re basically still stuck in the 2000s. \n\nEurope needs to wake up or they\u2019ll be a glorified tourist destination in a decade or two.",
         "He said (1) stop funding Russia with fuel and oil purchases from them and (2) spend more on your militaries to counter Russia. People just said he was an idiot and carried on. He was always right.  Everyone else was stupidly wrong.",
         "And we're failing to recruit new ones because despite school leavers actively *wanting* to join up, the last government totally fucked up the recruitment process by farming it out to a known incompetent private company, and our new government is failing to fix it.",
         "Active personnel total or combat Frontline?\u00a0",
         "I bet the polish leadership are absolutely bricking it reading the results. If Trump bends over for Putin, Poland etc will be eyed up",
         "The development in Latvia makes me want to look deeper into the specifics of each Country. Latvia got rid of it in 2007 and brought it back last year because of the obvious, the neighboring Bear..\n\nApparently the Baltics, Nordics, Greece/Cyprus/Austria are the only countries with the compulsory service right now. Fucking Switzerland of all places has the compulsory service...",
         "Probably would be a lot harder to pass in democracies than just spending. Especially if sending money means you never have to defend yourself.",
         "Some historians and experts have indeed already called it - and you\u2019re correct - Feb 22, 2022 when Russia invaded Ukraine. There are 8 ground wars going on right now. Insidious, deceptive, death by a thousand cuts. WWII didn\u2019t start with a bang but a sigh, and we\u2019re hearing americas death rattle as we speak. The void it leaves will be filled by China/Russia/and their evil little friend North Korea. Protracted collapse, sure, but a collapse nonetheless.",
         "The EU needs a bit more equipment, but they have plenty of troops, money, production and people to easily counter Russia. The world massively over-estimate Russian military and the Ukraine war exposed that, so really EU has been able to handle Russia since the USSR fell because since then Russia basically just stood still. \n\nI mean the proof is in the pudding, Russia can't even handle Ukraine with a bit of global aid for Ukraine. The EU would make Russia's military look like a third world army.",
         "There was a meeting however. Someone said \"2%, maybe\", and Trump ran with it as if it were legally required.",
         "We had a lot more on our military plate in 2014.",
         "Come on, try harder.

         "Obama had basically said the same. It was well known that some of NATO weren't doing their part of the agreement but it isn't and easily enforcable agreement and requiring concensus makes it very hard to crack down on.\u00a0The US\u00a0threatening to leave\u00a0is basically the only card\u00a0but playing it makes\u00a0the alliance look weak and thus emboldens\u00a0adversaries which is a component of why\u00a0Russia even\u00a0invaded.\u00a0\n\n\nUnfortunately, there were no good moves to make.",

         "In 2006 NATO members agreed to commit at least 2% of GDP to defense spending to ensure the alliance's military readiness. It is absolutely an obligation for all NATO members. This may be shocking to you but the scary orange man is correct.",
         "I\u2019m confused. Another President said the same thing and didn\u2019t get called stupid? What\u2019s your point?",
         "Yes, and as a still-active member of the party despite not being entirely happy with the new leader, I get that 14 years of wilful mismanagement by the previous ruling party can't be fixed\u00a0overnight.\n\n\nBut they are also actively going against election pledges and enacting policies to actively _not_ fix stuff.",
         "The Swiss aren't that surprising, they take neutrality seriously.",
         "Do not lie.  Because there\u2019s always someone out there who can catch you on it.\n\nIn 2006, NATO members did agree that they should **aim to spend** 2% of their GDP on defense. This was a guideline, not a strict obligation, aimed at encouraging members to contribute enough to support collective defense.\n\nThe 2% guideline was reaffirmed at the NATO Wales Summit in 2014, where NATO members committed to **aim to move towards** the 2% guideline within a decade\u201d (by 2024). However, this was a target rather than a legally binding requirement.\n\t\nStill today, the 2% figure is a non-binding guideline\u2014a shared target rather than an enforceable obligation. Members agree in principle **to work toward it**, but NATO has no authority to enforce this spending level on sovereign nations.\n\nBut let\u2019s end on a high note:  all but eight of the nations are on track to meet or exceed the 2% guideline by the end of 2024.  Yay!!! And those other eight are tracking upward.",
         "They said it was the only thing he was right about, not that he was stupid to say it. And he was basically copying Obama.\n\nyou claimed \"Everyone else was stupidly wrong\"\n\nWho? \n\nIf the president before him was saying the same thing who is the \"everyone else\" who got it wrong?\n\nI mean, the only reason Trump even knew about it is because it was a common talking point in the media about Europe's reliance on Russian gas and the lack of NATO defense spending. These were not ideas he came up with.",
         "Well, they finally woke up after the Russian invasion to Ukraine in 2022 and constant threats towards Poland and Baltic states, thanks God. Would have been nicer if they had done it back in 2006 instead of hiding behind the notion that the 2% requirement was technically not \"legally binding\"."

As a result, China stopped purchasing oil from Iran (though, in practice, it continued but in much smaller quantities and more discreetly), leading Iran into severe economic troubles, as its economy heavily relies on oil exports.\n\nWill this work again this time? Maybe. China is stronger than before and is likely to resist much more significantly now. If Trump succeeds in bringing Saudi Arabia to his side, it could serve as an interesting leverage point against China.",
         "I completely agree with you. Trump is excellent in foreign relations; he projects strength, and many are rightly afraid of him. His policies in Europe and East Asia are still not entirely clear, and we\u2019ll learn more over time, but when it comes to the Middle East, I think he will do an excellent job.",

We cut cost on maintenance, we get to see how our weapons preform in a peer to peer conflict, and if Ukraine manages to fend off this invasion we\u2019ll most likely see a collapse in the Russian government which would be good for damn near everyone",

         "People love conflating Palestinian national aspirations with literal Islamic jihad terror campaigns that pursue an endgame where israel ceases to exist. Palestinians don't want a 2 state solution right now, and that won't change until new leaders are allowed to come forward, and that won't happen until palestinian governance isn't an insular terror mafia that would rather brainwash their people into suicide attacks on the jews rather than forward palestinian political ambitions reasonably (not conquering israel) and peacefully. They could at least start a showing of good faith by not paying kidnappers of Israeli civilians and turning them into national heroes after they murder the captured foreign nationals. Or stop the \"solidarity\" attacks on isreali civilians when the idf goes to attempt to rescue hostages and prosecute the abductors.\n\nPart of the problem is that gazans really had the impression that 2014 was some sort of actual war to the isrealis, and not them holding back emensely. But palestinian deaths are celebrated as holy martyrs anyway, so it's hard for isreal to dissuade further attacks by limited force when they care equally for militant/terrorist deaths as they do for the accidental or collateral damage inflicted on their civilians, and treat all isrealis as Jewish occupiers, not just the idf, and thus targets. It's not hard to see why israel feels now that the only way forward to a peaceful solution is to demonstrate that hamas, or any jihad-based governing structure, will never be able to succeed in their aims, let alone thrive in their own feifdom as long as their policy towards israel is that of encouraging and enacting indirect fire, missile, kidnapping, and mass murder campaigns against civilians specifically. This is how some isrealis even justify settlements, because if they're going to be attacked and killed anyway, might as well give israel more strategic depth and control over a sworn to violence enemy.\n\nThe more hamas/pij/hezbollah gets outside encouragement, the worse off isrealis and Palestinians alike will have it.",
         "That's a straw man argument, they never suggested that. It's also a false dichotomy as you propose there are only two possibilities. Logical fallacies don't add to the conversation, they just fuel animosity and prevent dialog.",

Just carpet bomb it and get it over with if that is the objective.\u00a0\n\nThey will come back with the concrete though, as the idea is rooted in fairy tales of gods from both sides.\u00a0\n\nWhich is why, both of those options are just picking the scab. So to me, both of those are horrible solutions that aren\u2019t fixing the problems since they are both slaughtering people. Which equals no bueno but is easier to authorize behind a desk and camera, than actually running from a suicide drone.",

You can blame companies *and* understand that Tariffs are terrible for consumer markets.\n\n>We need to move goods to be made in the USA to create competition and lower prices.\n\nAnd ideally using both high-paid educated labor and trades labor to do it, sort of like the CHIPS Act and the Infrastructure Bill did. Americans aren't really looking for a massive about of low-skill low-paying labor.\n\n>If companies still make profits and not record profits for two years I don\u2019t think we should be pointing the blame on the guy whose trying to make everything American made and create more Jobs that way.\n\nAre you just assuming that US companies are not guilty of price gouging too? \n\nI'm not blaming Trump for the inflated prices, but once again I can blame him for making the problem even worse by introducing tariffs on consumer goods.",
         "> The world has returned to a somewhat normal place after Covid and yet we will still never see pre covid prices again even though companies record higher and higher profits each year.\n\nThe prices of cheap chinese goods being exported did not go up nearly as much as the prices of goods produced in the US, so that entire argument just falls flat on its face.\n\nIf anything tariffs would only exacerbate those problems by reducing competition for domestic manufacturers and adding a premium onto consumer goods.",

Big tech is anti-union, finance/crypto bros with autistic personality traits and big pharma fights against universal healthcare - oh yes, progressive. \n\nAlso, the fact that educated is now a bad thing? The ability to think critically, temporarily, and understand complex loosely related concepts!!! Although not always, on average, education and intelligence are causally related. \n\nRegan was the first to start making education unaffordable, for that exact reason - an educated population is more difficult to manipulate. People that understand the world tend to be more progressive and accepting of difference. \n\nRepublicans have always been the party of the rich. Lots of tax cuts for the rich \"trickle down economics\" - I believe when Bush was competing against Regan in the primaries he even called that out. A uneducated rural voter with kids they can't afford, can be manipulated the easiest.",
         "I think youre not framing it properly, democrats are the party of educated people, and educated people own big tech. \n\nthe less educated you are the more republican you are as thats why rural places are more republican.\n\nthis is patently obvious but i bet you'll figure out some way to disagree. \n\nAnd do you think universal healthcare will help the lower middle class or hurt the lower middle class? because one party has been pushing for it more than the other",

         "They didn't call it the *re*conquista for nothing. \n\nIt does make me laugh though when I hear Spanish antizionists. The irony seems to be completely lost on them. \n\nThen again, they also did the whole inquisition thing so holding entirely different standards for Jews is somewhat of a time-honoured tradition.",
         "The underlying issue is power. People find all kinds of excuses to garner power for themselves, and while religion has been a useful tool for many people throughout history, there are many other tools and excuses that have been levied into mass violence and tragedy.\n\nReligion itself is no more to blame for the violence it justifies as it is to credit for the charity it provides. Pretending otherwise isn't a wise fundamental truth so much as it's a way for people who are not religious in any way to pretend that they are not, themselves, a gear in the cog of somebody somewhere's ploy for power. \n\nIn my opinion this is the most obvious with the hatred of Jewish people. This hatred has followed them throughout all of modern history, but the reason is always changing. One thing remains the same, though - somebody always has something to gain by blaming the Jews for/accusing them of whatever it is they're being targeted for at that particular time in that particular place. The religion itself is secondary.",
         "I think you agree with what I\u2019m saying lol. Companies are the ones to blame for raising prices onto the consumer instead of eating it themselves because they make enough profit to do so. Why are we okay with the idea tarrifs have to go to the consumer when again the company can eat the cost and make a profit anyway."

I appreciate that the \u201ccommunist\u201d farce that your media painted him with was always going to be his biggest stumbling block, but would it have been as big a hurdle as Hillary\u2019s being a woman?"

         "Their bet was very fat on this guy. And now when they won the bet and have guy in a place that is eager to choke Ukraine to give up lands, Russians will just have a motivation to take as much as possible if this guy is committed to deliver whatever claims they will roll out. So basically they have no motivation to stop. Thanks a lot!",
         "The outcome says more about the American people than Trump. We are doomed just like the Roman Republic.  It was a nice run but all good things end.",

         "Trump isn't even sworn in yet and Russia is backtracking on peace negotiations\n\nIt's as if this has nothing to do with peace and everything to do with stopping aid to Ukraine, if only someone warned us",

         "Let's see what happens. Trump has promised he'd stop the war in 24 hours. Hopefully the fact that ruzzia says no means he takes it personally  and gets annoyed and just ends up greenlighting all the Ukraine needs to overwhelm ruzzia all in the search of stopping the war.",

         "Ukraine is probably already working on building nukes.  They have the know how, they have the material.  Zelenskyy literally told Trump they would build them if they had to not long ago.  I think they would and they will use them if it means life or death.  Now that that election has been decided, the trajectory could easily lead to further escalation.",
         "Good bye Ukraine. I'm sorry Americans voted like idiots",

         "The funniest part of this election is poor people who came out in droves for Trump voted away their safety nets. \n\nSay goodbye to social security. Say goodbye to medicare and medicaid. Say goodbye to preexisting conditions protections.\n\nI am happy i have a great paying job and so does my wife. We have plenty of investments and i still voted to protect those safety nets for people. But i am done caring because they obviously dont care.",
         "If Trump pulls US out then Ukraine will have free rein to attack whatever is necessary. They won\u2019t have to abide by any rules to survive. Sure they might lose support from starlink but those bombs will still deeper into Russia.\n\nRemember, cornering a wild animal makes it more aggressive and dangerous.",

         "Say goodbye to Ukraine",
         "I see two possible outcomes: Trump halts military aid but facilitates a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia, or he cuts off support, allowing Russia to aggressively advance and likely capture Ukraine within six months. If the U.S. shifts its stance and no longer sees Ukraine as a viable ally, Europe will likely follow suit, pulling their support as well and prioritizing their own defense buildup instead.\n\n  \nSadly in either event I don't see a reality where Zelensky isnt a assassination target at some point in the future.",
         "Will Trump give Ukraine to Russia and start WW3?",

I hope he will prove me wrong in January, and my child can finally meet the grandparents.",
         "To all the Ukrainians who had hope- we as a country have failed you.",

         "The other option would be getting some kind of assistance package from South Korea.",

         "Here we go.",
         "Now is the time for Biden to just send in troops to finish the job in the next two months, Desert Storm style!",
         "So an actual spokesperson for the Kremlin is using the forbiden W-word now?",
         "He needs to answer his boss.",

         "Now is the time to pull the trigger Biden.\n\nYour last chance of your legacy being different than the democrat that served the world to Trump on a gold plate!",
         "Didn\u2019t he say 48 hours?",

         "OK, Trump will give Russia until late January, 2025, to stop their invasion. Or maybe not. Perhaps Russia will want to stop their invasion asap.",
         "War will continue until morale is improved!",
         "Trumps plan is to talk to Putin to see what\u2019s up then cancel nato boom",
         "No shit. \"I wanted to make the world a better place as promised but everybody else just wouldn't let me do my thang!\" - Donnie the Dump",
         "Nonono.... Jan 7th it's over, remember?",
         "I mean, it very literally just can.  Troops might take a couple days to clear out, but they presumably wouldn't be shooting and bombing Ukraine on their way.",
         "They have a concept of a plan.",
         "Europe has time to mobilize now. They already had plans for Trump\u2019s betrayal. Poland and Ukraine cannot fall to Putin.",
         "Trump said he can stop it in 1 day\u2026 we will give him till Friday!",
         "So, the guy who stole Top Secret documents has been chatting with Putin. Normally that would be a case where FISA courts allow the NSA to listen in on a U.S. national.",
         "Yeah, they have to wait all the way until January to kill the aid to Ukraine and lift the sanctions.",
         "First lie is on the clock",
         "Yes it can. Trump said he will stop it day 1.  /s",
         "If USA support is reduced, use patriot missiles without approval",
         "All of NATO lost last night",
         "But drump said he'll end it in 24 hours :( Surely he can't lie?",
         "It sure can with the right amount of rubles for betraying Ukraine.",
         "President Trump said he can stop that in 24hrs",
         "I hope the World realizes that Trump won\u2019t become President for a while. There\u2019s still the Certification on Jan 6th and the Inauguration on Jan 20th. So there\u2019s quite some time for mischief and mistakes till then. In the meantime Biden is still President and his policies are still in place with his Supreme Court Immunity.",
         "I thought it was a \"special military operation\" Putin? \n\nHopefully this war comes to an end soon.",
         "But he said he could, he is respected around the world!",
         "Yes it could",
         "Why not? Trump is probably going to force Ukraine to meet Putler's demands. But Ukraine might decline and fight to their last man with EU support alone.",
         "Didn\u2019t he say day 1. Gotta wait till January.",
         "Sounds like clickbait",
         "My god.\n\nLet's just see what he does. It's like the Armageddon is coming with him voted in or something",
         "The EU must stand up. The EU WILL stand up. I hope the US doesn't embarace itself.",
         "This is foreboding.\n\nI don't think it's a simple matter of it literally taking more than a day. I think the Trump plan is on the table now. I suspect taking Kiev is still the goal.",
         "The best thing the US could do immediately is give Ukraine permission to shoot back",
         "Sounds like a fucking challenge to me",
         "This is not what our candidate promised us.",
         "Of course not they have the rest of the country to overtake first.",
         "In having an ally in the White House, I\u2019m sure Russian will escalate their aggression in Ukraine since NATO will do nothing to counter.",
         "God, Peskov has such a punchable fucking face\u2026",
         "They don\u2019t need to. Putin\u2019s going to be getting fresh NATO briefings soon.",
         "It would never have been solved with Biden or harris",
         "Thank you for sharing. It is important for us all to be prepared for any situation during uncertain times.",
         "Weapon industry is one of the main things keeping the Russian economy from collapse",
         "It's over for Ukraine. Russia knows it, we know it. Let's just be realistic. Same for Palestinians. Israel is about to be given a green light and a demand to end the Palestinian people.",
         "Wow, an honest statement from Russia",
         "Fucker is probably already talking to Russia through back channels like Republicans always do",
         "Trump will just say \"way\" to their \"no way\". Game over man, game over. It is really that simple. Believe me.",
         "Sucks that a Republican has been elected since Putin was close to surrendering to Joe.",
         "Why can't half of the Americans pretend there is no war like the other half then we'll all be good?? /S",
         "Trump will stop military aid to Ukraine, give 75% area to russia  negotiate and say to media that 15% was given which was already lost and war will be stopped.In the end 75% russia controlled and rest will be puppet govt of russia.Everyone wins and ukraine dies .",
         "The fact that so many people were crying about Ukraine when Trump won shows that they don\u2019t live in the daily struggle that some Americans do. If you\u2019re worried about being able to afford groceries this week, you\u2019re not worried about Ukraine.",
         "Why didn\u2019t they say this before the election \ud83e\udd14",
         "Now we just need to figure out how to make that happen",
         "Quick chat from the orange one and all sorted. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02",
         "Ahem. \"Special operation\"",
         "It's a simple as just giving it to them as well and moving on.",
         "Honestly, I still don\u2019t understand the point. Does Russia just want Crimea for a vacation spot and access to the ocean? At this point it just seems like a sunk cost fallacy where they\u2019re shooting themselves in the foot while also bleeding out and killing all of the young men by sending them into the meat grinder. Just\u2026 take your loss and back out. You\u2019ll be better off for it.",
         "Alright Trump. Please please open the can of whoop ass onto Russia. They are just begging for it now",
         "If you read beyong the headline, the Kremlin means that Trump's promise he can end the war overnight will not be accepted.\n\nAfter the election, they'll only be emboldened.  Russia does not care about the cost of human lives.  It never has.  And centuries of Slavs being treated like cannon fodder and meat has made them apathetic to it.\n\nSimilarly, Ukraine's polls show they will not give up no matter what.\n\nWe're in this for the long-haul.",
         "If they wanted, I'm sure the rest of Europe would even support the logistics of their retreat",
         "I would help them with packing xD",
         "LEON Musk can turn off Starlink access for Ukraine overnight. They rely on it heavily and Musk has played games with their access previously.",
         "They will after trump threatens zelensky",
         "They may as well, congress is gonna pull everything from them soon.",
         "I also wouldn't be surprised if zelensky now focuses on nuclear rearmament and makes it the number one goal",
         "I hope we'll at least try.",
         "It drastically increases the chance Ukraine chooses to start developing a nuclear weapon...like the next couple days Trump will be asked about Ukraine funding and if Zelenski doesn't like the answer then they'll start work on a nuke\n\nThey have the means, would take a few months at minimum. And the purpose isn't to use it really, but to force the rest of the world to intervene",
         "I\u2019d say Biden should say \u201cok ya use those missles wherever. Peace I\u2019m out bitches\u201d and then just kills over.",
         "I think that would be appropriate",
         "According to some, Ukraine is completely capable to assemble  a small nuclear bomb within months...",
         "With USA money . Not good",
         "I really hope the election is finally what lets Biden take the restrictions off of weapons use, but like everything else we will probably be disappointed.",
         "Nuclear test within a couple of months. They already have everything they need from materials to expertise to a delivery system.",
         "If you're thinking about long ranges missile strikes, it's impossible without US logisticical data",
         "Biden should unleash Ukraine these last few months.  No restrictions, give them all American equipment, do with it what you want.",
         "That\u2019s exactly what ukrainians should do. No need to ask permissions from US",
         "Honnestly why not. Like ehat do they have too lose.\u00a0 Obliviously not yet tho as biden might still pass aid.",
         "They can't afford to do that with Western weapons. That would just be \"well, let's just go out with a bang.\" They can't afford to turn away from all the other countries that trusted them with their weapons. They also don't have a very large stockpile and rely on regular rearmament.",
         "Clock is ticking. He said within 24 hours of being elected.",
         "Are you suggesting that Trump might have lied?!",
         "Yeah, but now he doesn't need votes. So his promises are as worthless as his businesses.",
         "He can just say he could have, but ukraine amd russia and the rest of the world disagreed, their fault. And his voters will just accelerate licking his asshole",
         "He can still keep it. As long as Putin is willing to pony up.",
         "I have a mixed outlook on this.  Trump is going to do what makes him look best and strong.  While I do think he will end up giving Russia much of what it wants, his ego won\u2019t allow him to be seen as submissive to Russia",
         "And who is the biggest Provider of NATO funds? ... right. Ukraine is fucked if Europeans aren't ready to spend hundreds of billions in the next 4 years and NATO is done for regardless.",
         "The rest of nato should just allow Ukraine to use their long range missile they\u2019ve supplied to hit targets deep in Russia",
         "One of the few things I'm willing to pay more tax over",
         "Russian media can again claim 'Trump is ours.'",
         "Well, he'll likely leave NATO, too.",
         "So EU has now to put their fingers put their ass and move. No one here needs US support to help ukraine and stop russia. Quite the opposite is the case. If EU countrys would be more badass russia wouldn't dare to move",
         "Right now I\u2019d call it a stalemate at best, slow loss at worse. Even with all the funding available they are running out of fighting age males.",
         "Trump will pull out of NATO then fly over to Russia to nosh Putin off\u2026.",
         "Trump is going to drill baby drill and bring the price of oil down so far Putin can\u2019t use it to fund his war",
         "Nevermind that. Why has noone considered the idea that Trump would start SUPPLYING RUSSIA?",
         "Defense companies will get their way somehow.  Much of the funding is by supply of US made weapons.",
         "Trump lifting the sanctions against Russia will help their economy a lot. Though I don't know how fast companies will be moving back into Russia after the losses they faced last time.",
         "Will we though? He's not the sole decision. I recall Mike Johnson being pretty serious about removing funding, then went to a classified briefing on it and did a 180.",
         "NATO is not an independent entity that can send arms or get involved in military activities without the express agreement by its members. NATO doesn\u2019t even have forces per se. They are military assets that are lent to operate under NATO command by member countries.",
         "'Trump will stop funding,'\n\nThe US gov isn't sending money directly to Ukraine, its spending that cash to upgrade its own reserves with new hardware, within the US, then sending the old surplus hardware to Ukraine to make space. Very little actual cash is going directly to the Ukie governments coffers.",
         "You just made me realize tRump said he wanted to remove us from NATO...\nFuck this world apparently",
         "I think it will be made very clear to Trump from the Pentagon how NATO lets the US have the influence globally it has.",
         "From the EU, you mean.  NATO is about to not exist.  America is only looking out for #1, everyone else can go fuck themselves.",
         "Indeed, 60 years of Russian 'Active Measures' culminating in a fascist president of the USA with the mental capacity of a spoiled toddler.\n\nThe Russians finished what the Soviets started: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQPsKvG6WMI&pp=ygUaYmJjIGtnYiBkZWZlY3RvciBpbnRlcnZpZXc%3D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQPsKvG6WMI&pp=ygUaYmJjIGtnYiBkZWZlY3RvciBpbnRlcnZpZXc%3D)",

They lost the popular and electoral vote because nobody turned out for Kamala.\n\nDo we not criticize the losing party even though they clearly ran a bad candidate and just as bad if a campaign?

         "Trump received less votes than he did 4 years ago, where the hell were the Democrats? 15m fewer votes. They allowed this to happen with their apathy. Every moron that refused to vote for Harris for some bs reason wasn't smart enough to realize how much worse Trump would be.",
         "Not Iran lol",
         "Don't forget the dipshit voters who just chose to sit the election out. Trump didn't gain votes since 2020. Harris just lost a significant amount of the votes that Biden had gained.",

He tried the Beer Hall Putsch, which was a coup in the early 20s and was such a staggering and incompetent failure because some idiot forgot to cut the phone lines into the rooms where they were holding-hostage the generals and other Germany war nobility. Incidentally, this sort of same staggering incompetence is what *saved* Hitler during the July '44 plot to have him assassinated. People always think the solid oak table is what saved him, and it genuinely did, but people also forget that there was an entire coordinated effort by many in the German Army to make this an an actual operation, including radioing out messages that Hitler was dead and then taking control of certain regiments, detachments and military installations. Well, in this instance, some genius forgot to disconnect the phone line of the room that (I believe it was Goebbels was staying in? Himmler? I can't remember). And they were able to place phone calls and tell people to stop the troop movements because Hitler wasn't dead (so they had found out). This lapse in judgement killed the plot in its tracks because so many of the troop detachments were following a plan put in place in case of Hitler's assassination/death in which so-and-so would assume command after that fact. That screw-up lead to thousands of people tortured to death, with many of these tortures being filmed for Hitler's personal viewing pleasure whenever he felt like it. \n\nWhile the Wehrmacht certainly played an absolutely direct role in the genocide on the Eastern Front and of the Jews, Slavs and Romani; this particular \"episode\" (re: plot) was actually a moral-revolt from within the Germany Army, who felt disgusted and dishonorable at the actions they themselves committed and were being ordered to commit by people higher up in the military high command. We have explicit instructions from people in the Wehrmacht high command giving-the-ok to exterminate the \"Eastern populations\". Incidences of alcoholism and suicide were so high in the SS, and army group populations that took to the slaughter, that this is where Himmler started coming up with ideas on how to efficiently and quickly \"Liquidate\" populations of people (re: gas camps).

      "comments": [
         "It's a really, really small tumble though. If you zoom out to a range of a year it's barely visible. The won has been tumbling down for quite a while now.",
         "On the bright side, this is a great excuse for SK to start their own nuclear weapons program since the US has just proven itself to be extremely fickle.",
         "Korean passing by\n\n\nAs a Korean, what concerns me most about Trump's Korean Peninsula policy is his attitude toward North Korea's nuclear weapons. I am afraid that in order to focus on the China issue, he will actually condone North Korea's nuclear weapons and treat it like a country like Pakistan.",
         "well yeah, Trump is going to basically sell them out to China.  What do you expect?",
         "Oh \u201cwon\u201d is a currency.  I thought the title was the result of poor translation",
         "If only Harris had Won the election.",
         "What did they win?",
         "Time to visit Korea!",
         "Allies know the US can't be relied on for the next 4 years.",
         "Funny cause the dollar soared",
         "Headline reads \u201cSK \u201cwon\u201d tumbles\u201d, which made me go \u201cwhat is/are tumbles?\u201d",
         "I hate this type of title. A currency cannot tumble. A ratio of two currencies yes.",
         "This story is idiotic.\n\nEvery currency \"tumbled\" vs. the US dollar.\n\nYes, go check them.  The US dollar got \"stronger\" against pretty much every currency in the world from the 5th to the 6th of november.\n\nedit:  I checked the majors, sorry if I missed some and you found one that is opposite.",
         "It's like \"or world will works as is was before or i'l take the money and go to New Zeland\".",
         "Yep. Here we go. I'm heavy hearted.",
         "Korea will be screwed so badly by trump with their American lap dog president.",
         "That was a useless article that provided no analysis.",
         "Every currency soared. Worldwide phenomenon\u00a0",
         "Didn't realize that the Won is the South Korean currency.\n\nHere I thought they won some sort of cup due to the Trump win.\n\nLearned something new today.",
         "It's a 1.4% move...  \nWhy are all these headlines so trash.  \nCue hundreds of comments talking how this is super relevant even though no one can google a graph.",
         "Another way of phrasing the headline would be the dollar strengthens after Trump wins presidential election.",
         "Let's face it, Trump didn't win because he's Trump. He won because the Democratic Party chose a candidate who the public views as incompetent. She had 4 years to prove herself while Biden's health was declining. Now here we are.",
         "How big is the squid game payout now?",
         "Also isn't the SK won kept puposefully cheap given SKs GDP?",
         "yeah, 1.5% \n\nnot insignificant for a day or two, but nothing special really\n\n\"tumbles\" XD",
         "When 10y tbill yields in usa increase, investors switch to dollars. Its a very simplistic explanation.",
         "I am 100% sure we will also either see an EU or if that is not feasible a German nuclear arms program. The situation in Eastern Europe just got a whole lot worse.",
         "everyone should, really.  Lots of weapons and agreements that don't include useless america.",
         "Fickle? Were under foreign, adversarial  control",
         "That's my take away from this. The US is just one election away from their U turns.",
         "You should probably read up on history. The US has been nothing but fickle since it's inception with allies. Just ask the Kurds, or translators we needed and used for our last two wars.",
         "It\u2019s my understanding that SK doesn\u2019t want nukes, and has argued against US nukes being there as well.",
         "Ukraine as well and Japan.",
         "I'm definitely not smart enough to figure out all of the fallout of this election but a few are obvious. The main one is that there will be more countries with nukes in 4 years than there are now with S Korea, Japan, Germany and Poland being the most likely candidates.",
         "As a Korean American I'd agree. Japan has started militarizing as well since the past decade. Fortunately, when it comes to regional stability. Korea and Japan are capable of working together when it comes to China and North korea",
         "you think a Trump administration would have an issue with a nuclear South Korea?\n\nlol",
         "Who is it you want nuked exactly? Why does SC need a nuclear program bc of who is US president? Your logic seems non-senseickle, unfortunately.",
         "He already did back in his first Presidency. This time, though will be so much worse....",
         "You need your own nukes. This is obvious.",
         "No - this isn't unique to Korea. This is a Korean source so it's talking about the won tumbling, but really what's happening is the US dollar is soaring against every currency. \n\nTake a look at US markets today. Wall Street is thrilled by the election result. US stocks and the US dollar are up significantly.",
         "As much as I hate Trump I don't agree with proping up countries which should be sufficiently developed and stand on their own.\n\nIf S. Korea can be successfully sold out at this point, that's on them.",
         "I thought Koreans were betting heavily and tumbles was a synonym for \u2018lots\u2019",
         "Or if the Dems had picked someone better. I voted for Harris but she was a terrible decision when we needed a win.",
         "The people have spoken.",
         "They won tumbles. It's right there in the title.",
         "I\u2019m selling shirts for international travelers if you\u2019d like to buy one:\n\n\u201cYes. I\u2019m American. No. I can\u2019t explain it.\u201d",
         "[deleted]",
         "Looks like the website is from South Korea, so it makes sense that they write how the US elections affected them instead of how it affected the dolar",
         "> the dollar strengthens after Trump wins presidential election\n\nAnd that's exactly what happened.  The Dollar is up against the won, pound, euro, swiss franc, etc. etc. etc.\n\nWhether it's just another day and 1% movement, or the election, I have no opinion, but everybody's reading this story exactly backwards.",
         "That is a more accurate reading, given the Yen lost the same value and the Euro even more.",
         "That's literally what I thought as well.",
         "Incompetent because she isn't white and she's a woman. That lady is more competent than half this fucking country. The problem wasn't her, and the problem won't change.",
         "Trump won *because* he's Trump. No other Republican or politician could have ever pulled off a political comeback like this. Half of Americans are firmly in the MAGA cult that teaches Trump is Jesus.",
         "It's a free market exchange so supply and demand influence it's value.\n\nJapan is one country that keeps it cheap but it's more complicated than your statement above. There is so much to the valuation of a currency and the growth of its economy",
         "Exactly. There's a reason why the results of this election show people ignoring the media: It's because they push headlines like this. Dollar goes up, other currencies go down - That's the nature of the USD being the reserve currency of the world. It has nothing to do with South Korea's confidence, or lack there-of, in the US election.",
         "You do know the French have had a nuclear program since 1969",
         "Yup.  German rearmament.  I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m even saying that lol (I\u2019m not lolling really I\u2019m sad).",
         "Finland and Sweden could very likely get a prototype up and running in a month or so.",
         "It\u2019s worse here in America I promise. Some Karen was flashing cars from an overpass on my way to work this morning",
         "Japan, Taiwan. Nukes for everyone.",
         "Germany getting nukes? Sure, buddy, that's never gonna happen under democracy.",
         "The Nordics (or just Sweden alone) could also easily develop an independent nuclear weapon system if the political will is there.",
         "We\u2019ve just sent a message to the rest of the world that if you don\u2019t have nukes, you better have lube",
         "This WILL happen.  Every fucking shit country with enough resources will arm up.  No Ukraine fuck up for mid-size counties!",
         "At this point, any country with the money, resources, and technology to crash develop their own nukes can just go right ahead for all I care. There's no real point in stopping nuclear proliferation now that the planet is completely fucked either way.",
         "I'm seeing an economic growth model for countries with a rocketry industry and access to uranium...",
         "American here, please do that.  Agreements can and will include the US, but everyone should consider self sufficiency at this point.",
         "So many kids in here that don't know how the world works. Your candidate lost, at least pretend american politics isn't your entire personality.",
         "And tens of millions of Americans either love that fact or just don\u2019t care",
         "technically speaking we aren't under adversarial control since the people voted for this to happen...aka this was welcomed and not at all adversarial.",
         "That was under the previous liberal administration. The current one is very right-wing. Korean right-wingers tend to be more pro-US but are also more open to developing an independent nuclear arsenal. Park Chung-hee was the president of South Korea for most of the Cold War and had concrete plans to develop nuclear weapons by the early 1980s, but he was assassinated by someone who was probably in close contact with the American CIA.",
         "Germany should 100% develop nuclear weapons and ICBMs. France and UK just aren't enough for Europe. Station some in Poland as well.",
         "I doubt that's the fallout of this election.\n\nCrimea and then Donbas showed the world that.   Qadaffi's violent demise probably underscored it.",
         "He didn't, though, that's why the negotiations broke down... They had some of the most extensive trilateral negotiations between NK-SK-US they've had since the war and Trump met with Kim in person at the DMZ and all that jazz... But the negotiations broke down because Trump's team insisted on NK denuclearizing in exchange for normalized relations and lifting of sanctions and they wouldn't budge on that issue, so the talks ended up going nowhere.",
         "More nukes is always better",
         "Doesn't Wall Street almost always rise after a clear winner (ie. not Gore/Bush)? A determined result = stability",
         "Wall Street is far from thrilled. The market is pricing in inflation and higher rates in response, because tarrifs are going to make everything more expensive. Say what you will about offshoring jobs, but China selling to the US at dirt cheap have kept prices down. In a higher inflation environment, income earning assets like stocks are what keeps value. Yields on treasuries have shot up. If Wall Street is happy, bonds wouldn't be diving off a cliff.",
         "Yeah it turns out when you have an incoming administration that treats labor rights and regulations as the equivalent of toilet paper, and offer lower tax rates, even if it breaks the government, then companies and their wealthy shareholders can make more money.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIt sounds like the US doesn\u2019t want to have a government that protects the people, just powerful companies that run everything and treat human life as disposable slave labor.\u00a0",
         "... But China is nearly 30 times their size.",
         "So China should just consume every country?\u00a0",
         "Because isolationism worked out well the first time/s\n\nMaybe Poland should have been more developed to win a war on 2 fronts/s",
         "**i like to remind people the US does NOT give away security for free! they often come with sovereignty and economic concessions that benefit the US.** Nations that accept US military assistance often have to hand part of there foreign policy decision to the US, do business with US industry and companies at the detriment of home industry, and sell resources at reduce prices, just to list afew of the many things that come with importing US security. \n\nThis idea of it being a one way street is flawed, \"South Korea does not need to stand alone\". If one is willing to take the economic damage, increased competition for US business, less stability for the US in the world order due to ripping up long lasting US security than that is a fair position to take! just dont pretend its only benefits Korea, its a two way street.",
         "The only way America is \"propping up\" South Korea is by stationing about 20k troops acting as a tripwire and trading. There's over 20 times more South Korean soldiers defending the country than US soldiers. The US does not give SK money like it does to Israel or Egypt and has impeded South Korean nuclear development in the past.\n\nEDIT: Also, Korean companies are actually among the largest investors in the US economy. Entire states in the southern manufacturing belt have their advanced industries heavily dependent on Korean investment, imports, expertise.",
         "I think there is a poem that speaks to this.  It's an old one, you might not know it.",
         "Oh man, gonna be a long 4 years of you unintelligent traitors.",
         "Ahem. US is suffucuently developed and stands on their own. Would you rely on them?",
         "How would Democrats have presented a \"change\" candidate to sway the economy-first voters that broke 80-20 for Trump?\n\nGetting nominated by the incumbent party on the basis of not continuing the incumbent policies, having relevant national experience and exposure without having voted to install those policies... Who? MORE progressive wasn't going to be an option, what kind of fiscal-Republican social-Democrat is supposed to have been the winner of the democratic primaries?",
         "They were saying that the donated money from Biden Harris could be allocated to harris's campaign. If it were a different person... You would have to give back that money or it would be in some type of legal limbo",
         "I think people just ignore what Trump has actually done for the country or are so bigoted that they don't care.",
         "And the people are stupid.",
         "It's reflection time. It obviously won't help pointing to the man; convictions, hater, liar, or the insane focus on the few attendees at his meetings. It was all pointless. \n\nI bet he won on the policies and fear. Now go back, create that Democratic monster that can actually beat him not just being not Trump like Biden did. \n\nThe democrats had the best economy ever - and still lost. Now go ask the left leaning trump voters why they voted for Trump or you'll lose it again. \n\nCheers from Europe",
         "I love how you\u2019re downvoted even though the people have literally spoken. Harris lost the popular vote. \n\nThis site will never change and then wonder why they are wrong again in 4 years.",

Trump isnt tanking the only asset he treasures - real estate.",
         "Will the French and the Brits use their nukes to defend Eastern Europe? I\u2019m going to say no and Eastern Europe needs to arm up with nukes",
         "I never said they didn't. But they unlike the US do not share with NATO partners. There is no common EU nuclear arms program.",
         "By doctrine the French nuclear umbrella does not extend to the rest of EU. It\u2019s not a credible deterrent.",
         "The French don't seem to have a big enough arsenal and they can't win a war of attrition against Russia with Chinese and American supplying them. They'll lose by simply being isolated. \n\nNot to mention that they're heavily infiltrated by Russians as well. It's possible that by 2026 Le Pen is in command with a Russian as her defense minister.",
         "You guys want Germany to rearm. But wait until AFD becomes majority. Then we may start questioning why the fuck are they arming that much.",
         "Do they have the capacity to produce sufficient quantities of enriched uranium?\nBecause design & construction is not the hard part of nukes, obtaining the\nfissile material is. (Which is incidentally one of the strengths of Germany.)",

         "I've been commenting this for years and got downvoted to hell and back. Welcome to the new era of nuclear proliferation!",
         "to be fair, there's arguably far worse things than simple nukes that we can do with current tech, like bioweapons.   Could Trump now fuck up international relations enough that people bring bioweapons  back on the table?  Probably.",
         "Maybe Biden should have helped them instead of used them as fodder.",
         "I thinking it was Ukraine that sent that message, and they not only said it, they showed it with blood and suffering.",
         "They only care about their personal finances, which are overburdened with credit card debt\u2026. We\u2019re literally a nation who is loyal to the highest bidder, aka Russia",
         "That's where I'm at, the US is going to get what it voted for and the EU will be weaker without a reliable partner, but the writing has been on the wall for a long time. American support has always been a \"smile while I twist your arm\" affair.",

         "France and UK - with a bit of arms build up and cooperating together - could put 480 nukes on 3 SSBNs permanently, plus a bunch of cruise missiles. There's enough there. It would take about 550 SLBM warheads apiece to be able to do that (3 full loadouts of 160 warheads, plus 15% spares for maintenance)...that's only just over our peak",
         "It is too early to judge Trump\u2019s North Korea policy at this point, but I believe that at least during this term, he will form a cabinet of only obedient people. That is why I am afraid of his second term.",
         "No. Its not. But its clear you cannot rely on USA anymore. This was made clear from ukraine in 2014.",
         "It does tend to shoot up more for republican victories than otherwise.  It shouldn't be a huge surprise either, wall-street thrives when big corporations thrive, and what is it that the republican party panders to the most?",

         "Yeah it's not good in 1-2 years from now when people are going to complain about growth and inflation lol.  Trump wants to even get rid of the fed chair. if Congress approves this... Holy fuck... There is no way they could be that stupid",
         "Yep. And as things get more expensive by 13-20% trickle down economics do not work. Corporations are greedy just like their leader. It\u2019s nice in theory but when you expand profits that doesn\u2019t flow down to the employees. \n\nUnder his last term my cost of living raised exponentially. Remember when 12 eggs were 6 bucks? By my annual COL raise stayed right at 3% as it was before trump, and after trump, and for the 13 years I\u2019ve been at my company. Typically 3% is fine but when your every day house hold items have raised 10-15% the math stops mathing. \n\nI\u2019m in an industry that will be secure under his leadership, but while he\u2019s concerned with helping my bosses (his like minded people), me as the average American will suffer. \n\nHope everyone is happy!

Now? Well, hopefully the materials can still be locked up, but we all have our doubts about that.\u201d Obtaining sufficiently enriched fissile material could be difficult but, when it comes to creating the bomb, \u201cIt turns out it\u2019s not overwhelmingly difficult. There are some subtleties that are not trivial ... but an awful lot has been published.

It will borderline the absurd as the sheer stupidity that will need to be said to justify things will be off the scale. \n\nPutin needs Trump to direct the US to isolationism, reduce NATO support, reduce Ukraine support but also somehow convince Russian people that the US remains a threat to them in order to continue their pursuits of conflict to create a buffer between Russia and NATO, whilst at the same time not pissing off Kim who he needs to also convince that the US remains a threat to them in order to keep the munitions flowing. \n\nKim needs to somehow be friendly with the US so that their ties with South Korea wane and they won\u2019t back the South Koreans as much but remain strongly against the US and NATO in order to placate their growing relationship with Russia in case the Ukraine war continues. We don\u2019t even know whether he likes Trump or not after their bromance kinda fizzled out and he is now in a position where he has to make a choice to satisfy his own relationship with Putin of remaining anti-US or sacrifice that so that he can achieve his own ambitions of venturing south as the US loosens its ties with the South Koreans. \n\nTrump will now likely think to placate Putin at the expense of all other current US allies which then leaves them in a position of possible weakness, reduced military base options and reach, reduced trade income (which he hopes to make up through tariffs) but then also somehow convince the rest of NATO that his placating of Putin means that they should not fully rearm to defend themselves against Putin and Kim when the US is removing their stance of protection. The Europeans aren\u2019t just going to sit back and watch so he has to make a choice on which side be butters his bread. I suspect common sense from his staffers will lean towards NATO. As for Kim, if he looks to reignite the friendship, Putin may have some major questions about that relationship if the US remains in NATO. \n\nOf this group, Xi is the only one who even remotely looks like they may be reasonable and have any form of foreign policy competence and that is saying something. In a meeting of the minds, Xi comes across as the most reasonable which means that we have gone wrong somewhere as a species. \n\nOn top of it all, Trump isn\u2019t anti-NATO. He wants proper spending from all nations and he wants the Europeans to buy arms which he openly admits. If he wants to satisfy his economic mandates, rearming Europe is easily the most fruitful way to do this with military contracts. \n\nHis economic policies come in direct contradiction to foreign policy if isolationism is the choice. It\u2019s almost impossible to navigate these paths for even the most competent politicians. \n\nI sure hope Americans are strapped in as I suspect a lot of bumbling madness is about to ensue and the first few years will be about enforcing some of the backwards things in stateside domestic policy rather than changing the status quo in foreign and military policy.",

         "So is Musk, yet despite his sympathies Starlink is still being sent to Ukrainian military (whatever sabotage he's been up to notwithstanding).\n\nAt Trump's age and 2nd term, there's not much carrot or stick Putin has left to use on him. Trump can ghost or betray Putin just like he's done to every other friend he's had, and there's hardly a pro-Russia consensus among the Republican Party either (about half and half I think). I don't think the piss tape is real, and even if it was would Trump even care? Blackmail might just piss him off at this point. Bribe? The entire world would be watching those finances, plus Trump can either take the money and run or just ignore it. MJT or JDV telling him to do it? Marjorie's a nobody and he hates JD, and half the GOP is still telling him to send those guns over. He can't even pull out of NATO given congressional laws.\n\nThe war is lucrative for the US military-industrial complex, and that kind of institutional power is really hard even for the president to stop if Congress wants the aid to continue. Last aid package to Israel was tied directly to Ukraine aid, and that's unlikely to change if half of Republicans and virtually all Democrats in each house decides to leave it that way. Mike Johnson did plenty of obstruction and bought Putin half a year, but apparently that wasn't enough in the long run.\n\nIn practice, aid to Israel likely dries up when aid to Ukraine does. That's all it would take to keep things on life support. I reckon Trump doesn't care about either Putin or Ukraine enough to change this too much, and the conflict Israel is waging puts immense political pressure on his administration to keep the status quo. He burns bridges with his other friends too that way (Netanyahu and his own family even with the Kushners), plus it's become clear his political stance is only as deep as the last friendly face he's talked to that day.",

         "Pretty sure there was a really good write up about this in the Foreign affairs the other day talking about the risk of there being some kind of accident because Russia hasn't moved its nukes away from the front lines.\n\nMy take on this is two fold.\n\nFirstly a drone blowing up a nuke isn't going to cause a mushroom cloud at worst its going to create a \"dirty bomb\" effect and given the design of modern nuclear weapons this \"dirty bomb\" effect wouldn't be quite as bad as you might think.\n\nSecondly if this did happen how do we think Russia would respond. Personally i don't think they would want to even acknowledge that its happened because it would show a kink in their nuclear armour as such i think if this happened anciently they would downplay it or just ignore it.\n\nIF however Ukraine was to start a deliberate campaign of trying to target Russian nuclear weapons in a move to either disable or weaken the Russian Nuclear deterrent then that would be a nuclear provocation and could be a casus belli for a nuclear response. Probably why Ukraine haven't been doing it i would imagine that they've been told through back channels that if they start that shit, Russia is going to respond.",

         "I\u2019m glad Reddit doesn\u2019t represent the majority of the population because some of these takes are just abysmal. No one with a sane and sound mind would want any country to attack a nuclear arsenal and risk nuclear retaliation at a scale that could affect the entire planet and all of us that inhabit it. \n\nNeither here or there, there must be an end result to the war\u2026no one will be coming out as a \u201cwinner\u201d. Massive casualties have been felt on both sides, infrastructure decimated and its ongoing.  The best outcome is an amicable agreement between Ukraine and Russia. What that looks like and how we arrive at that point I\u2019m sure almost none of us know. \n\nAll aside, it will take more than just the USA to stop Russia and the most practical approach would assume that the EU players would also allow their weapons to hit targets within Russia but they have shared the same stance as USA\u2026..because Nuclear war is real and scary. Elections aside just because trump won, doesn\u2019t mean the end all be all. Critically think for a second.

If they do, we've got more to worry about.\n\nThe fact Russia is being so lackadaisical about its nuclear stockpile is probably a good sign. If they're really not taking any measures to protect warheads in storage despite repeated warnings, as the article says, then it might even (possibly being overly optimistic here) be a sign that the cores are past their \"use by date\" and Russia knows they don't even work anymore.",

And way got a lot more than their results last election earned. \n\nI have one big hope SPD and Gr\u00fcne can now try got get rid of the debt limit. the one thing holding Germany back more than anything. even the conservatives know that it was the \"Schuldenbremse\" that stopped this government, and while they would not admit it they also know if they get elected ruling with the \"Schuldenbremse\" is impossible,.",

Or the FDP could declare the coalition over, than a vote of confidence would make sense.

Yes because they won't be part of the next government, unless Merz from the CDU says fuck it and makes a coalition with them which I don't think he would do *yet* (meaning the coming election). No because they are already pretty strong in the east, especially Thuringia and Saxony. Where they recently both got about 34% of the votes. And the other parties are struggling to build a coalition there at the moment.\n\nFor all of Germany, the AfD currently has been sitting around 17% in polls for basically almost all year.",

         "Current government is a broad coalition of center SPD, slightly (lower case l) libertarian Green and hard economic right FDP, which is not the greatest recipe for a functioning government.\n\nElections three years ago were poorly timed for left parties, as a few months before the election, left parties were polling much higher and SPD and Greens could have formed a gov't by themselves. \n\nEspecially economically, the gov't is often split on issues and not as effective as it could be without the inclusion of a economic right party, so many solutions are compromises which aren't nearly effective enough to combat the mismanagement of the do nothing attitude of the previous 16 years status quo attitude of coalitions with the authoritarian right CDU.\n\nThe current government is also adhering to the debt brake of the previous government, limiting investment into important issues.\n\nAll of this combined with far right propaganda, especially but not limited to defaming the Green party as much as legally possible, was leading to rising dissatisfaction with the government, even from it's own rows. Now, this dissatisfaction will probably culminate in the dissolution of the government, leading to new elections with the authoritarian rigth CDU expected to take the helm, with possible junior parties being SPD, the hyper right wing, nationalistic, authoritarian, populist AfD (think Trump and his Ghouls) or the populist, nationalist, conservative BSW.\n\nSo all in all, unfortunately we can expect a shift to the right towards populism and authoritarianism, in line with but not quite as bad as what we see from the US.",
         "Social Democrat led government with strong Greens and market liberal FDP. SocDems and Greens are pretty much on the same line, but governing with the FDP has been a challenge.\n\nRough few years had the conservative CSU regain most of their losses and far right AfD rise. All the while the far felt Linke commited sudoku when about half their members joined the BSW, economic left and socially right populists, who have been going strong since.\n\nCSU will most likely lead the next government with 30% in polls, but the junior partner is still a question. FDP would be ideal for them, but they're likely to not make the 5% necessary to even enter parliament. AfD is right out, but the SPD are unlikely to want to be a junior partner in a great coalition again. The Greens would have the numbers, but they have been the scapegoat of both the right and the left for everything wrong.\n\nFun times ahead.",

         "Nah, even in recent years, Merkels 16 year do-nothing attitude was much worse for Germany. \n\nIt's really the age old story, a conservative government runs the country into the wall and then, when people finally have enough, they elect a progressive government that then wants to right the wrongs of the previous government, which is expensive and takes a long time. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the current government is problematic and I'm not a big fan of the FDPs inclusion (which was necessary to reach a majority), but it's miles better than a CDU lead coalition would be for the country. Unfortunately, I think that's what we will get next, which is when the aforementioned cycle will simply start over.",

         "I'd still argue Merkel was the worst. She was quite popular and during her reign, the Germans were off the best, except for 2009. Yet she is basically head of doing nothing and divesting important infrastructure instead of laying the groundwork for the future.\nThe current government is stuck trying to fix the mistakes of the past and the next government will continue Merkel's path of pretty much doing nothing.",

         "He's betting that by going out now those who didn't vote for them recently were just doing so to get them to leave the coalition and he can get them back. I do hope this selfish maneuver will get him punished at the polls though. But who knows.",
         ">AfD Chancellor next?\n\nFortunately not a chance, they still dont have a partner and most likely CDU/CSU will be strongest by a margin in the next election. The next chancellor should be Merz. \n\n>I don\u2019t get Lindner\n\ntrust me, you are not alone.",

The SPD is one of the main driving forces behind policies which have triggered the rise of the AfD/BSW and at the same time they're sucking up to Putin. Scholz is the least popular chancellor since almost 30 years.",
         "Eh there won't be two elections that close together. One of them is going to be moved to the date of the other and since hamburg is just a state that one is just going to be a week later.\n\nSo even if it would somehow help them there is absolutely zero chance of the state elections in hamburg happening a week before the bundestags elections.",

         "Will depend on the exact results, but their preference is generally FDP>SPD>Greens. At this moment, it's unlikely that FDP will get the required 5% to enter parliament, so the current most likely option is CDU/CSU+SPD (\"grand coalition\").

At least, I hope Merz isn't that - or as, given Lindner - stupid. (The only parties that would win from that nonsense are - potentially AfD and BSW.)",
         "basically, a government should invest whenever the economy is struggling. Basic example, demand is down, construction companies can't build for private sector. If the government invests now, they first help the construction companies and save lots of money. As the price woudl be way lower. But with the Schuldenbremse intact, the government can only invest heavy if the economy is booming. This leads to the government overpaying and being inflexible.",
         "Not *wasting* money is a good thing. And of course it is always about balance...\n\nBut money which you (\"properly\") invest into Education and basic infrastructure (roads, rails, electricity, ports) has a hugely positive ROI - **even if you go into debt for that**.  \nArtificially stifling that investment means you're handicapping yourself.\n\nGermany has not invested (enough) into infrastructure the last 2 decades and the cracks start to show.",
         "No. It just sounds good. But governments don't work like companies. As long as you don't royally fuck up your economy a government has a steady income from taxes, tariffs and so on. Thus it can take out big loans and invest wherever it's needed (Germany for example is struggling with its public transportation, electricity, health and educational systems which not only need lots of future investments but also reforms). And to pay off loans (since the government is always liquid) it can take out new loans and so on. This can basically go on forever since there's a steady cashflow and it doesn't really matter how big the debt is. See for example the US having a debt of around 223 trillion dollars (and rising) right now but is the strongest economy in the world.",

Massive changes had to be made and they were successful, creating the only economic growth in recent times that actually narrowed the gap with the United States.  \n  \nToo bad he turned traitor afterwards.",

If we had elected a right-wing government, then the right-wing government would be unpopular, like was the case in the UK and is still the case in Sweden right now.",
         "I would rather blame the FDP and their desire to make every discussion public and their disgusting blamegame which they kept up all those years.\nThe FDP are the worst thing for most of the German citizens.. they want to lower taxes for the rich and reduce the retirement plans for all citizens. This would massively widen the gap between the rich and the poor. The wants to further support the gasoline and diesel car industry and frankly doesn\u2019t give a shit about the environment or the normal people in Germany. \n\n99% of the conflicts in the current government were caused by the FDP.

He supports the legalization of rape within marriages , wants to support the fossil fuel lobby and fossil fuel powered cars , wants to stop environmentaly friendly energy sources and do much more worse things. His way of speech and it\u2018s contents remind me of Trump and it\u2018s truly worrisome.",

They have ruled out a coalition with both Afd and die Linke, and both Merz and S\u00f6der have been riding the anti-greens hate train for years. Maybe CDU-BSW? But seems less likely tbh.",

         "But the Union wants to keep that rule for their coalition. That way they can easier argue about cutting a lot of social costs while still lowering taxes for companies and high earning people.\n\nMakes it easier to put preaure on SPD or greens. Pretty much what they did under Merkel, just way more intense.",
         "At the moment, I would say it's unlikely they could. One good thing that happened was that they plummeted in the polls earlier this year because of a very controversial meeting with fascists from other countries where they discussed and planned deportations. This sparked a huge wave of protests where hundreds of thousands of people went to the streets. So a lot of \"protest voters\" turned their back on them then. \n\nThe other thing is the emergence of a party called BSW whose figurehead Sahra Wagenknecht is very popular in the east. The party is populist and also on Putin's payroll but they aren't fascist. Sahra Wagenknecht used to be in the party \"Die Linke\" (meaning the left, a democratic socialist party) but a lot of her ideas clash with Die Linke. I wouldn't call BSW a leftist party though, just populist. So, I think a bunch of protest voters went to BSW instead. \n\nIt will still be very interesting to see how the next government could be formed. Everything is looking a bit shaky and uncertain at the moment.",

         "They likely do have an indirect effect on foreign policy already, together with the other pro-Putin party BSW.",
         "It depends. A possible issue could be that the far-right AfD and the populist/structure-conservative leftwing BSW get more than one third of the seats, since both oppose the support of Ukraine. In that case it would be impossible to make additional debts that are required to fund Ukraine since a 2/3 majority in the parliament would be required.",
         "Fascism\n\noften Fascism : a populist political philosophy, movement, or regime (such as that of the Fascisti) that exalts nation and often race above the individual, that is associated with a centralized autocratic government headed by a dictatorial leader, and that is characterized by severe economic and social regimentation and by forcible suppression of opposition",

         "CDU/CSU (conservatives) and AfD (far-right) are going to gain a lot of votes.\n\nNo party really wants to form a coalition with AfD (thankfully) but CDU/CSU are not wording their disapproval as strongly anymore as they did a few years ago when AfD did not have that many votes yet.\n\nGreens are still going to be around and BSW (far left but with strong sympathy towards Russia) just formed this year and is also gaining quite a few votes in polls.\n\nSPD (center-left) will still be around, but probably a good bit less votes than they got last time.\n\nFDP (upper-class focused finance-loving libertarians - basically economic-right and don't care about anything else) are probably going to be irrelevant in the next election.\n\nDie Linke (far left) will also be irrelevant.\n\nMight come down to CDU/CSU+SPD+Greens, as long as the CDU/CSU does not fuck around with the AfD just to get back in power (CDU/CSU was part of the government for the prior 16 years).",
         "CDU, which is center-right, is leading strongly. Likely outcome is a coalition of Center-right and center-left, which in practice ends up being just center-right because the SPD is a bunch of spineless lickspittles.\n\nTo be fair, though, it looked similar before the last election and CDU managed to fuck it up by nominating an idiot. Greens had good chances before the least election but were and are targets of massive misinformation campaigns by right leaning media. \n\nThe most important information for everyone outside Germany is that the far-right AfD will likely have large gains, but them being involved in any government is very unlikely.",

Standard behavior. Cursing the government, but no arguments at all. And especially no solution. I asked this question quite a few times, and nobody knows problems going above AfD paroles, and even more important, not even once did I receive a solution for ANY named problem. Not one.\n\nEdit2: Aaaand the next. Looks like I won't see any AfD voters on this platform anymore at this pace.

Lula is not the \"good vibes\" people paint him either, his party flirts _a lot_ with dictators, and they time and time again try to pass laws that are not constitutional and would keep them in control in some way or another. Trump was elected being a convicted felon, and there are currently laws that excuse presidents of some (most?) crimes; Lula had his crimes \"nulified\" for some reason; both show how far corruption have gone, in both countries.\n\nThe worst part?

         "\"How easily is my buddy going to let me have ukraine?\"",
         "Things could potentially get quite complicated.\n\n\\* Russia is in a stage where it might need the war (to continue): Putin might desire to conquer more territory, to divert attention away from increased internal issues, to prop up an economy that now seems to strongly depend on the war, ... Trump's swift \"end the war in 24 hours\" might be completely incompatible with that. Especially a sudden end to the conflict could destabilize Russia internally, by consequence challenging Putin's ability to maintain control  (though thus far Putin has proven himself quite capable of handling that). While it could also endanger Trump's ego and thus Trump and Putin's love affair because Trump wouldn't be able to deliver on one of his main promises. (In the past, the \"end the war in 24 hours\" probably very strongly favored Russia - hence why Trump stated it, but the situation has changed in some ways since when he first stated it)\n\n\\* Iran serves as a critical ally for Russia, providing support that can counterbalance some of the Western influence. Trump's adversarial stance toward Iran, coupled with strong ties to Israel, could lead to policies that undermine Iran. Actions against Iran might inadvertently weaken Russia's strategic alliances and complicate Russia's war in Ukraine. This could also affect support Russia receives from Iran and could even divert away Russian resources from Ukraine.\n\n\\* China is a target of Trump and a frenemy of Putin, but also on whom Russia very strongly depends. But China also depends on Russia in some ways (mainly resources). Thus any action of Trump against China could have unpredictable consequences when it comes to China's actions. Additionally, China doesn't want a strong Russia, for obvious geopolitical reasons as well as it being no secret that Russia wants a weak China too. They need each other in some ways, but each wants to dominate over the other. If Russia wins in Ukraine, Russia could gain relative strength against China and be in a position to further hurt Chinese interests.\n\n\\* Trump is very erratic and his babysitters commonly deviate from his policies. Meaning we could see any number of random things that could hurt Russia's interests as well as reduce Trump's fondness of Putin.\n\nWhile damage to Ukraine's interests is very likely, I don't think \"defeat\" is completely certain or clearcut. China is a bit of a wildcard too, while unlikely to take action to aid Ukraine, it also is the one nation that could most strongly sway the war in Ukraine's advantage. Add that Zelensky (and his team) are very good at some types of communication - thus if anybody non-malicious were to be able to influence Trump in their favor - it might be them (obviously still wouldn't be a walk in the park).",

They have been convinced that the 'liberal' media just targeted Trump and blew his incompetence and destructiveness out of proportion, because they chose to ignore it and don't know any of the details for themselves.\n\nTrump's actions as president were *significantly worse* than most people know or are willing to believe - just his actions regarding Ukraine are completely horrifying and disqualifying for anyone who paid any attention at all, but evidently almost nobody did. This time he will not be constrained by any of the dozens of old-guard Republicans who told him 'no' last time. 'Why can't we nuke a hurricane to blow it off course?' Could easily, and seriously, turn into, 'Why can't we just nuke Kyiv to end the war?' More likely, he'll just cooperate with Russia openly and give Putin whatever he wants. There will be nobody to stop this demented fucker from making decisions just that insane and self-serving on a daily basis. Anyone willing to stand on principle or draw a line of any sort will be purged from the administration.\n\nHundreds of Billions were spent targeting young people this election cycle, spreading vile regressive propaganda and attacks on liberal ideals to the younger generation who aren't already captured by Fox News or talk radio. I believe the battle (and perhaps the war) was won in convincing most of that generation not to vote. I firmly believe the Elon Musk purchase of twitter with his and foreign billions and the Rogansphere extreme right podcast/streamer contingent is what made Trump a viable candidate after all he's said and done. It must be acknowledged that there is a baked-in evangelical religious devotion to the Republican party which is decades in the making, with decades of life remaining, and I'd argue that accounts for *most* GOP votes, but I think driving apathy in the face of open rising theocratic fascism among the younger generations as a whole is what won this election, and it's incontrovertible proof to me that humans (and certainly Americans) aren't equipped to deal with the 'information' age.\n\nIt seems that Trump did not lose an appreciable number of voters from 2020, which is nothing less than an indictment on the American people. His horrific management of the pandemic and all that entailed may have hurt him in 2020, but it was evidently forgotten. His months-long, multi-state, many-lawyered attempted coup which culminated in him sending a mob to stop Mike Pence from certifying the election did not lose him voters. His generals saying he's a danger to the country and a fascist, he himself saying he'd be a dictator on day 1 who would jail (at best) his political enemies did not matter. His 34 felony convictions, his absconding with top secret defense documents, hiding them in his unsecure bathrooms, and attempting to destroy the video evidence of his henchmen hiding them from the FBI did not matter, none of it made any difference at all.\n\nThis is not a messaging problem, it is a propaganda problem, and it is a reasoning problem. The American people did not reason themselves into electing Trump a second time and I don't see how we reason our way out of the Supreme-Court-legalized autocracy that we just voted for.",

Not anymore, as Putin made the first move.  \nAnd it makes perfect sense for them to be willing to, as they would rather have the troops fight in Ukraine, rather than defend their own cities with Russian artillery reducing the buildings to rubble. With civilians still living there. Again. And then abducting the children. Again.  \nNone of them want the fight to go that far, and they are willing to step up to make sure this is the last war Russia will fight in a long, long while.\n\nI hope this is the war that breaks the back on the russian military as well as their economy.\n\nFuck Putin.

         "The pager attack was against hezbollah, not hamas. Hamas apparently was able to do Oct 7 because bibis government was so convinced that hamas just wanted to rule gaza so much that they wouldn't launch a wreckless attack/war on israel, because the consequences for doing so we're never in doubt. The idf and security aparetus was mainly deployed along the west bank and northern border areas because they feared hezbollah and terror infiltration as a more likely threat to Israel than Gaza. Judging by the docs they've since found in Lebanon and the west bank they were right to be worried about that, but completely failed israelis when it came to defending against hamas in gaza. They even saw iranian trained and armed militants rehearsing the attack, but when fed up the chain of command, all they got back was, \"hamas knows they're not capable of pulling off a victorious assault like that and won't try it.\"\n\nEdit: in contrast, israel has been preparing for an eventual war with hezbollah since shortly after 2004. Hence, the instant decisive blows they were able to achieve when they felt they could focus their military efforts to the north to try to return their displaced civilians back to their homes and stop the daily rocket/mortar/drone attacks from sourhern Lebanon.",

         "The reason for that is because Israel was prepared for tensions in the north, but didn't take the idea of a threat to the south as seriously until it actually happened.",
         "They did know, they were warned by both the US and Egypt (and potentially others) days and weeks in advance, and Israel had the battle plan more than a year prior, and were warned three months in advance by their own intelligence that Hamas had carried out training per the plan.\n\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/30/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-attack-intelligence.html",

The latter is essentially a supply chain attack, something that's familiar only to people working cyber security and only since about 2018. What made the exploding battery plan possible was that it was the first of it's kind and utterly unexpected.\n\nThe October 7th attack was the opposite end of the spectrum. It benefited from being low tech, played close to the chest but also being so ambitious it sounded like nonsense. The issue most inteligence agencies face isn't that they don't hear about an attack, it's that they hear about a hundred planned attacks and usually zero actually happen.",

         "That\u2019s pretty accurate.\n\nNetanyahu was being charged with corruption and facing trial.\n\nSo he devised a plan to fundamentally change the Justice System in a way that would conveniently allow him to make the dead to rights corruption charges no longer matter.\n\nThere were nationwide protests including citizens serving Israel\u2019s mandatory military service refusing to report for duty (very illegal).\n\nAs this was all coming to a head and his consolidation of power over the Justice System was about to occur the 10/7 attack happened.\n\nNetanyahu then negotiated with the largest opposition parties in Parliament and it was agreed upon that the Justice System reforms AND new elections would be put on hold until the military actions resulting from the 10/7 attack were finished.\n\nSo now the war hawk Prime Minister is protected from the consequences of his corruption so long as he keeps finding ways to continue military operations.",

The CIA officials who concealed this information were on a joint agency Bin Laden task force that lawfully required them to share intel with the FBI. They broke the law out of inter-agency rivalry and hubris, so the FBI never received the intel on the hijackers until it was already too late to arrest them. The FBI agent leading the FBI arm of the Bin Laden task force was also muscled out of his leadership role by the Bush Administration because he was too loud about the issue, and he went on to become the director of security at the World Trade Center and was killed in one of the tower collapses. The CIA officials responsible for lying to be FBI were allowed to keep their identities secret by the 9/11 Commission, though it is strongly suspected the woman who later received credit for finding Bin Laden is in fact the lead Bin Laden task force member who directed the CIA arm to keep the FBI in the dark.",

Applying a conservative estimate of four indirect deaths per one direct death to the 37\u2009396 deaths reported, it is not implausible to estimate that up to 186\u2009000 or even more deaths could be attributable to the current conflict in Gaza. Using the 2022 Gaza Strip population estimate of 2\u2009375\u2009259, this would translate to 7\u00b79% of the total population in the Gaza Strip. A report from Feb 7, 2024, at the time when the direct death toll was 28\u2009000, estimated that without a ceasefire there would be between 58\u2009260 deaths (without an epidemic or escalation) and 85\u2009750 deaths (if both occurred) by Aug 6, 2024.  \n  \nAnd...it is also important to note that not all of these deaths have actually occurred at this point.  The current war has health impacts that will continue to kill people for years after the actual conflict ends.  I haven't seen any estimates recently, but I'd guess 70-80% of all structures have been destroyed.  All infrastructure has also likely been destroyed.  There are probably thousands of bodies buried in the rubble.  People we don't even know are dead yet and that aren't counted in the 45K.

No such crimes from Christian motivations have been reported in KPMD-PMK to date.\n\n>In the period from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2016, 16 fatalities from homicides in the category PMAK were statistically recorded by the Federal Criminal Police Office. Since January 1, 2017, 3 fatalities from homicides in the category PMK-religious ideology have been recorded by the Federal Criminal Police Office.\n\n>Since January 1, 2017, 1 fatality from a homicide in the category PMK-foreign ideology has been recorded by the Federal Criminal Police Office.\n\n>These figures are provisional and subject to change due to updates and amendments.\n\n>Best regards,\n\nThat's 18 victims from right wing violence and 19  from foreign crime.",

Lebanon, for example, was majority-Christian at the time, and aligned with other Arab countries on common *ethnic* grounds.\n\nAs a useful litmus test, we can look at similar national movements for *majority-Muslim* non-Arab indigenous ethnic groups. The Kurds are a solid example, where many regional Arab leaders, when addressing the prospect of a *second* non-Arab independence movement, take similar stances and postures to how they frame their rejection of Israel: *These are Arab lands and we must fight against Kurds/Jews/Copts/&c forming a sovereign country*.\n\nAt its core, the conflict began as an ethnic one and its ethnic underpinnings still form the foundation of the problem \u2014 even if the growing religious layer to the conflict keep pushing a just peace further and further out of reach.",

This section ensures that incriminating evidence provided to a parliamentary committee may not be used directly in subsequent criminal proceedings except in a prosecution for perjury or for the giving of contradictory evidence. However, it is important to point out that in spite of the legal protections available to witnesses, the possibility exists that as a result of media coverage of the committee proceedings the possibility of a fair hearing in court could still be compromised. For example, while a committee's minutes would not be admissible at a criminal trial, the testimony could assist a police investigation or direct a Crown prosecutor to a line of questioning useful for his or her purposes which otherwise might have been unavailable for the purpose of prosecuting the offence.

It's as if reality holds no grounds anymore. Go visit Iran (as many YouTubers have) and then make YOUR OWN decision about their culture, lifestyle and/or how oppresive it is. \n\nIn regards to women and being safe. The more Islamic a country's government is and the more they prescribe the \"headscarf\" (the thing Mother Mary wore), the less rape and sexual assault occurs in the country, because, the sole reasons of the headscarf  is that it is mandated by God and that it is to protect a women's chastity \u2014 we know how women get treated when they show their bodies off and objectify themselves. \n\nA woman is more likely to get assaulted in England, France, Namibia, The U.S, Sweeden or Botswana than she is in Iran, Saudi Arabia, or Afghanistan (the only countries that have MANDATED the headscarf). Out of the top 50 countries with the highest rates of rape only 4 are \"headscarf wearing ones\" (Pakistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Turkey). In other words, a woman is safer in a headscarf wearing country than in a non headscarf wearing one.\n\nThe reason a woman might feel \"oppressed\" is because she wants to show her self off, or doesn't believe in what God has mandated, it's simple. Now, should women be allowed to dress in booty shorts if she desired, or be legally forced to cover herself up in public is the debate to have. Using the \"safety\" argument is a misnomer.\n\nDon't be biased, be fair.",

This piece of news at Radio Farda's website also states that after the attacks' news was released, some Iranian citizens gathered in front of the Embassy of Switzerland in Tehran, which serves as the protecting power of the United States in Iran, to express their sympathy and some of them lit candles as a symbol of mourning.",

         "It's always been weird to me that the most Jewish sect in the Jewish country surrounded by other countries that would love nothing more than to erase their entire existence from the face of the Earth are against serving in the military that protects them. Like... I get not wanting to die. But when your entire existence is on the line, then wtf?\n\nThis is coming from a non-religious person not over there though, so maybe I have a very ignorant/simple minded view of the whole ordeal.",
         "Is this an hypocrisy issue ? like \"we don't have to do military service but you all really are forced to\" ?",
         "Ah, thanks!\n\nCodifying a current policy into an explicit law makes sense.",
         "Ahhh.\n\nI see why he's not a fan of their Supreme Court, saying they actually have to follow laws.",
         "Ideologically they are the result of an agreement that Israel signed, and before Israel funded Hamas with the explicit intent of destabilizing the PA, they were the best chance of a two state solution.",
         "So fuck the PA because they\u2019d be a legit government and you can\u2019t morally justify bombing a people properly represented?",
         "The rehabilitation of Germany and Japan was only possible because they had an immensely powerful benefactor (United States). Due to the strategic regions you two occupy near China and Russia, it was in America's best interest for you to be powerful, independent, and friendly.\n\nFor a similar project to work in Palestine, there is no benefactor that meets the necessary criteria: benefits from a strong Palestinian state, is rich enough to bankroll development, is militarily capable of occupying the area and preventing terrorism, is trusted by Israel enough for them to agree to it",
         ">Probably a commenter that\u2019s generally critical of Israel and views the whole admin as bad.\n\nLike most sane people who believe in human rights. Can't believe that other commenter is still asking what horrible things Gallant has done.",
         "Doesn't really change much. This war has a much lower civilian casualty rate than other urban conflicts.\u00a0",
         "Ultra-Orthodox, yeah. Chassidic, not entirely. Chabad is technically Chasidic but I wouldn't consider them ultra-Orthodox like I would Satmar or Bobov Chasidim.",
         "I don't like the term Ultra-Orthodox at all. I prefer using the term Haredim, which is how they refer to themselves. Hasidim (\"Hasidic Jews\") are one of the two large groups (each consisting of various communities) that comprise the Haredi population - Hasidim and Litvaks (Litvak means Lithuanian, but a Litvak doesn't have to have much to do with the country of Lithuania, it means that the way they study Torah is according to the tradition of the Jewish institutions - yeshivot, that existed in the Polish-Lithuanian commonwealth). The English terminology tries to simplify, because for the most part non-Jews (and even many Jews) aren't that interested in learning about the characteristics of different religious Jewish communities.",
         "Ill be honest. \nEven I dont know why they are against this.\n\nBut they always lived on our backs like this and have no wish to change it. \n\nWe pay taxes when they dont. \nWe serve in the army when they go to state funded religous instutions and do useless shit there. \n\nIt wasnt an issue when they were a very small minority, but that is no longer rhe case.\n\nI dont hate religion, but them? Them I hate.",
         "From my understanding and limited experience, it's a combination of two things. One, the Haredim feel that they lend spiritual support, rather than material support (which would be IDF). Two, the Haredim aren't too keen on secular nationalism (in fact, some ultra-Orthodox groups opposed the idea of a secular Israel to begin with).",
         "Disclaimer: I am not a Jew nor an Israeli\n\nIn the most radical form, there is a sense in which Torah and the study of the Torah and living by the Torah is the sole purpose of Israel. If Israel loses a war, the lesson would be \"we didn't live by the Torah, so Israel deserves to be destroyed: it is God's judgment.\"",
         "Yes. They hide behind the excuse of \"studying the bible and appeasing God\". They even claim we're winning the current war mostly thanks to their thoughts and prayers.",
         "Bibi will literally do anything to remain in power. \n\nThe damage he caused here is insane. \n\nHe killed the israeli left, he inflamed tensions here beyond anything we ever had and destroys us from within.\n\nWhat he has done today is beyond wild, to put it nicely.",
         "Yup. Hence his infamous judicial reform.",
         "What makes you think they'd be a legit government? Are we just gonna ignore their decades of corruption, their rejection of having elections for years, for their pay-for-slay program which rewards families of suicide bombers?\n\nThey're not going to be any better than Hamas.",
         "If you count the kids as terrorists, then maybe. But at this point there have been more children killed in Gaza than total civilians killed in Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.",
         "Can you elaborate?",
         "How/why don't they pay taxes?",
         "Yeah, their main claim is basically \u201cthey come in Kharedi and come out secular\u201d. They\u2019re afraid mandatory service will break their society apart (which I\u2019m all for, lol)",
         "They think studying the Torah and the other religious bullshit they do is literally the most important thing anyone could do on earth. Thus OTHER PEOPLE should go and fight and die while they sit at home fucking around. And its an honor to fight for them, in their eyes.  They are parasites on the society of Israel.",
         "yay even more lunatics",
         "I'm not counting the civilians as combatants in terms of civilian casualty ratio because that would be dumb",
         "The global civilian casualty rate in urban conflicts is 9 to 1. According to the UN.\u00a0"
