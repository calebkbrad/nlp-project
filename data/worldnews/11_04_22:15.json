Canada's only role in all of this was to pay for a highly useful complete SAM system as part of its support for Ukraine.  Canada also donated several hundred SAM missiles of which some were intended for the system but have since been used by Ukraine (which is fine).\n* There has been a litany of issues on the American side of the equation in scheduling production.  It has to do with the manufacturing model used for NASAMS (\"instance based\" ) and also some politics in America related to prioritizing American support, which put the CAD paid system to the back of the line.\n* and sadly in Canada the main opposition party used the delays, which were entirely outside the control of the CAD govt, for political football/govt bashing.  And their supporters ate it up.  The CAD govt could say little in return as it was bound under various confidentiality agreements.

The list of procurement projects is significant and when done Canada will have a new navy, and almost an entirely new air force.  Even for ground forces projects are moving along, but it is in ground assets that there is the most difficulty in \"getting it right\".   But even there some momentum is building.  \n\nI am happy to provide a reasonably comprehensive recap from a comment a couple of months ago if anyone is interested.  There is so much disinformation on the topic of CAD defence spending.\n\nBut there is also merit in the point that it needs to increase, and do so more rapidly.

The problem is it became more and more apparent that in an actual fair competition the F-35 would kick the shit out of everything else, just like it has in every competition held by our NATO allies. The Government then invented the capability gap bullshit to further delay the F-35 decision. Boeing's shenanigans over the C-series then made *that* politically untenable, as well as knocking the only other sorta real contender out of the running (the Gripen was never being seriously considered). That's when they finally decided to go to the F-35.... literally when every other option was worse politically.",

IMHO that process has started, but still has a long ways to go.\n\nDND and the public service are both encountering procurement related issues due to that long period of neglect.  These are well publicized and I assume you are aware of them.  Defence purchase contracting is a specialty.  Canada now lacks enough people who have this expertise.  The old group has retired.  And the people who have it can make 3x the salary doing the same job in America.\n\nBut the point of my initial comment is that there is much disinformation about Canadian defence spending.  And people often bandy about the famous NATO ratio without understanding how it is calculated or some of the difficulties that Canada in particular faces in achieving it.  The difficulties are not insurmountable, but they require both political will and the support of the population.  I feel that latter has been happening only lately as finally Canadians are waking up to the fact there are many enemies to our country that most had not previously envisaged as actually being hostile: China and India come to mind as examples.",

He is a total yes man and blinding bafflegab and ineffectualness are his hallmarks.",

It's now a war crime if Israel... and only Israel... does not supply the people who just attacked it with food, water, medicine, electricity, household goods, building materials.  Also, even if Israel does supply all these things, it's also a war crime if Israel does not also ensure that the people they're fighting don't steal the supplies.\"\n\nOh no, what shall Israel do without friends like that..."

         "The UN frequently passes resolutions that condemn a thing but does not provide any mechanism for enforcement. Let us call these \"opinion\" resolutions. They are easy to pass because allies of the condemned entity know it won't affect much. For example, China and India abstained (i.e. didn't even vote against) the condemnations listed at bottom.\n\nHere are key UN resolutions that condemned Russia's actions in Ukraine:\n\n1. UN General Assembly Resolution ES-11/1 (March 2, 2022) - \"Aggression against Ukraine\"\n\nAdopted in an emergency special session, this resolution condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine and demanded an immediate cessation of hostilities and the withdrawal of Russian troops. It passed with 141 votes in favor, 5 against, and 35 abstentions.\n\n2. UN General Assembly Resolution ES-11/2 (March 24, 2022) - \"Humanitarian consequences of the aggression against Ukraine\"\n\nThis resolution addressed the humanitarian crisis arising from the conflict, calling for the protection of civilians and humanitarian aid access. It also criticized Russia for causing this crisis. It passed with 140 votes in favor, 5 against, and 38 abstentions.\n\n3. UN General Assembly Resolution ES-11/3 (October 12, 2022) - \"Territorial integrity of Ukraine: defending the principles of the Charter of the United Nations\"\n\nPassed after Russia\u2019s attempt to annex several Ukrainian territories, this resolution declared the annexations invalid and reaffirmed Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. It received 143 votes in favor, 5 against, and 35 abstentions.\n\n4. UN General Assembly Resolution ES-11/4 (February 23, 2023) - \"Principles of the Charter of the United Nations underlying a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in Ukraine\"\n\nAdopted on the eve of the war\u2019s one-year anniversary, this resolution called for a peaceful resolution to the conflict that respects Ukraine's sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity. It passed with 141 votes in favor, 7 against, and 32 abstentions.\n\nHowever, the UN sometimes passes resolutions which include an action; let's call these \"action\" resolutions and discuss two of them.\n\nUN General Assembly Resolution 302 (IV), which established UNRWA, does not grant the agency authority to operate in areas without the consent of the countries that control those areas, nor does it authorize UNRWA to enforce its presence forcibly.\n\nUNRWA's mandate is humanitarian, focused on providing relief, education, health care, and social services to Palestinian refugees, and it operates with the cooperation and consent of host countries. The agency\u2019s activities depend on agreements with these host countries (such as Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, and, in certain areas, the Palestinian territories under Israeli control).\n\nUNRWA's presence and operations are therefore contingent on these countries allowing it to work within their jurisdictions. Any deployment or expansion of its services requires negotiation and mutual agreement, as UNRWA lacks any enforcement or military capabilities.\n\nGiven UNRWA operates in Gaza only with permission from Israel, I would have expected them to better consider Israel's, expectations of avoiding providing support/employment to Hamas. Despite Israel publicizing some malfeasance, I haven't seen any official self-reflection from UNRWA discussing how it might better weed out militants from its operations or distribute aid in a way that doesn't make Palestinians more dependent on Hamas. This seems arrogant to me and I'm not surprised that Israel revoked permission for UNRWA to operate on its territory.\n\nUN security council resolution 1701 _allows_ but does not require UNFIL peacekeepers to intervene to prevent Hezbollah from operating south of the Litani river. UNFIL has chosen not to use this authority and instead has passively stood by while Hezbollah broached the agreement. Unless UNFIL changes its policy and decides it will enforce the agreement, I expect Israel will press UNFIL to vacate South Lebanon",

The real reason is \u201cwe\u2019re banning chemical weapons because it\u2019s cheap and ineffective and we get brownie points for banning it\u201d. \n\nWeapons that cause horrible scenes aren\u2019t banned if they\u2019re *effective*. Exhibit A: nukes. Nobody with real power thinks the USA and or allies wouldn\u2019t use chemical weapons if it actually worked (again, see nukes). Banning cheap stuff like chemical weapons is convenient for the USA because it doesn\u2019t impact their military strategy, but reduces the options available for poorer countries/terrorist groups. \n\nThat\u2019s the real reason why sometimes countries respond with a yawn to chemical weapons being used. Sometimes the enemy using chemical weapons is a convenient excuse to engage, if you want to engage (see: reports of chemical weapons in syria or iraq). But it also can be conveniently ignored if you don\u2019t want to engage.",

         "The article: \nSweden has vetoed plans for 13 offshore windfarms in the Baltic Sea, citing unacceptable security risks.\n\nThe country\u2019s defence minister, P\u00e5l Jonson, said on Monday that the government had rejected plans for all but one of 14 windfarms planned along the east coast.\n\nThe decision comes after the Swedish armed forces concluded last week that the projects would make it more difficult to defend Nato\u2019s newest member.\n\n\u201cThe government believes that it would lead to unacceptable consequences for Sweden\u2019s defence to build the current projects in the Baltic Sea area,\u201d Jonson said at a press conference.\n\nThe proposed windfarms would have been located between \u00c5land, the autonomous Finnish region between Sweden and Finland, and the Sound, the strait between southern Sweden and Denmark. The Russian exclave of Kaliningrad is only about 310 miles (500km) from Stockholm.\n\nWind power could affect Sweden\u2019s defence capabilities across sensors and radars and make it harder to detect submarines and possible attacks from the air if war broke out, Jonson said.\n\nThe only project to receive the green light to was Poseidon, which will include as many as 81 wind turbines to produce 5.5 terawatt hours a year off Stenungsund on Sweden\u2019s west coast.\n\n\u201cBoth ballistic robots and also cruise robots are a big problem if you have offshore wind power,\u201d Jonson said. \u201cIf you have a strong signal detection capability and a radar system that is important, we use the Patriot system for example, there would be negative consequences if there were offshore wind power in the way of the sensors.\u201d\n\nA Nato maritime commander said earlier this year that the security of nearly a billion people across Europe and North America was under threat from Russian attempts to target the extensive vulnerabilities of underwater infrastructure, including windfarms, which he said had \u201csystem vulnerabilities\u201d.\n\nV Adm Didier Maleterre, the deputy commander of Nato\u2019s allied maritime command (Marcom), told the Guardian in April: \u201cWe know the Russians have developed a lot of hybrid warfare under the sea to disrupt the European economy through cables, internet cables, pipelines. All of our economy under the sea is under threat.\u201d\n\nSweden\u2019s energy and industry minister, Ebba Busch, said it had been a tough announcement to make, but that security policy was paramount. While many Nato countries are rapidly expanding their wind power, Busch said they were \u201ccleaning up an incredibly messy system\u201d.\n\nNato recently established a centre dedicated to undersea security at Marcom\u2019s UK-based headquarters in Northwood, north-west London.",
         "The reason for this: Sweden has various sensor networks on the bottom of the baltic sea (ahem, rumored, etc) as well as land-based radars to detect inbound near-surface-level missiles from Russia.\n\nThese windfarms would impact the precision/response time of both of these to such a degree that this is not something that can be allowed.",

Knowing their at the mercy of Israeli pilots, and then throwing their nuts in a situation where they have to follow up.... idk what they have as everything i was briefed on has probably been replaced. If i had to venture a guess, though.... they slipped in some of those hyper sonic missiles in the last attack and got the green light to use more. If they dont just use them to get penetraiting shots in the middle of a barrage, i would again guess that they are just going to launch a small barrage of hyper sonic missiles, maybe even just one.  Because that's punching through a lot of very advanced air defense all the way to Israel and then the iron dome at the end of the gauntlet. \n\nI very much doubt they would use nukes, but if it comes out they are using new missiles, i would also expect the announcement of nukes.

         "Ukraine is in war which obviously is a dire situation. However, Poland is not going to take a part in the war. Poland as a NATO member will not drag the alliance into the war despite Ukraine's difficult situation. So we can probably forget about any direct Polish participation in the war in Ukraine, such as shooting down missiles over part of it.\n\nAt the same time, Poland has already sent a huge amount of aid (mostly secretly) and continues to send it. Now, as one can see, it is offering credit. So I think that this should help Ukraine and President Zelensky could hold back a bit in condemning allies who are constantly supporting Ukraine in various ways.",
         "Makes sense, money should not be the issue right now",
         ">Poland has proposed that Ukraine buy weapons from it on credit and then pay the costs back after the war, foreign minister Rados\u0142aw Sikorski has revealed. His remarks came shortly after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky appeared to criticise Poland for not providing Kyiv enough military support.\n\n>Speaking to broadcaster Polsat, Sikorski said that \u201cour government made a new proposal, a defence loan\u201d, to Kyiv. \u201cIt could have been done from the start, \\[saying\\] \u2018go ahead, buy from Polish factories on credit, and when you rebuild, you will pay it back\u2019.\u201d\n\n>\n\n>The Polish foreign minister\u2019s remarks came a day after Zelensky singled out Poland for apparent criticism over its alleged failure to provide promised MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine.\n\n>Zelensky\u00a0said\u00a0that an agreement had been reached for NATO to provide \u201cair policing\u201d in Poland, as it does in the Baltic states, to protect the country if it donated its MiGs to Ukraine.\n\n>\u201cWe agreed on this, but after that, did Poland give us the planes? No,\u201d said the Ukrainian president, quoted by The Kyiv Independent. He then suggested Warsaw had found \u201canother reason\u201d not to transfer the fighter jets, without providing further details.\n\n>\n\n>Zelensky also said that Ukraine is \u201cconstantly asking them \\[Poland\\] to shoot down \\[Russian\\] missiles\u201d, for example those that threaten a gas storage facility in Stryi near the Polish border.\n\n>\u201cWe have good relations with Poland, Polish people support us\u2026\\[But\\] did the Poles shoot down the missiles? No,\u201d said Zelensky, quoted by Euractiv.\n\n>The Ukrainian president\u2019s remarks met with a sharp response from Poland. Speaking to broadcaster Polsat, Sikorski noted that Poland has given Ukraine \u201cmore tanks than the United States, Germany, France and the United Kingdom combined\u201d.\n\n>He added that he \u201chopes that Ukraine understands that Poland is a frontline country and we also have to deter Putin\u2026We have the right to defend our skies\u201d.\n\n>\n\n>\u201cPresident Zelensky should direct his requests to those countries that are further from Ukraine, further from Russia, further from the frontline, because they can afford to give Ukraine more,\u201d said Sikorski. However, he also urged understanding for Zelensky, \u201cwho does not have it easy\u201d.\n\n>Meanwhile, defence minister W\u0142adys\u0142aw Kosiniak-Kamysz tweeted that \u201cPoland has given as much military equipment to Ukraine as possible \u2013 however, the limit is Poland\u2019s defence capabilities and security\u201d.\n\n>Regarding the idea of Poland shooting down Russian missiles over Ukraine, Kosiniak-Kamysz noted that the decision must be made by NATO collectively, and so far no such decision has been made.\n\n>\n\n>In July, Poland\u00a0proposed\u00a0that it be allowed to shoot down Russian missiles that are in Ukrainian airspace but heading towards Polish territory. However, NATO\u2019s then secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, rejected the idea, saying it would risk NATO \u201cbecoming part of the conflict\u201d.\n\n>In the months after Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Poland was\u00a0among the leading donors of military equipment\u00a0and other forms of aid to Kyiv. That included transferring over 300 tanks to its eastern neighbour.\n\n>However, while Warsaw has continued to support Ukraine diplomatically \u2013 calling for greater international aid for Kyiv and tougher sanctions on Moscow \u2013\u00a0it has argued that its own capacity to make further donations of equipment is now limited.",

         "The comments in this thread are insane and divorced from reality. The stated goal of these reforms is to reduce the power of the Prime Minister, increase separation of power, etc. \n\nNot to mention that Ali Riaz, head of the constitutional reform commission, is a professor at Illinois State, studied at University of Hawaii, and has written books on Islamic radicalism - this guy is extremely western-oriented, he's non a fucking imam.",

         "Yes. Indians are going to bangladesh and are taking videos of houses being ransacked and burned all the while hiring some really convincing actors to play the part. Give me a break, and for once, open your eyes. \n\nWe don't have to misinform anything when the entire world knows how a certain religion behaves when they become the majority and when they know that there are no rules to govern them.",
         "Yea I guess when you get rid of everyone then there is no one left to mistreat lol. The region's Hindu portion of the population was 33% in 1900...22% post partition...13% in 1974 and now it's down to 7%. Most of the reason is emigration due to mistreatment (such as the vested property act)",
         "Hate is always wrong, but Bangladesh is a part of Bengal that was islamized. Hindus were converted by heavy taxation, violence, abduction of children, humiliations, unfair laws. Hindus were humiliated by muslim and christian invaders for centuries ON THEIR OWN sacred lands.",

         "Because there are clearly problems with the Bangaldeshi government that stem from, or are enabled by, the constitution as currently written! Sheikh Hasina gave her authoritarian rule constitutional legitimacy - so of course the first priority of a post-Hasina government would and should be to remove this artifacts of her rule",
         "Sorry but this is an extremely simple and propagandistic version of Bengali / Bangladeshi history, and ignores how throughout the Islamic period, much of the real power was exercised by Hindu landowners - which eventually became the feudal and hereditary zamindar system which included both Hindu and Muslim families in the dominant ruling class.\n\nNot going to disagree that British colonialism was a humiliation and replete with atrocities, but part of British colonialism included the active participation of these Hindu and Muslim landlords in starving their own tenant farmers to death - so it's not like Bangladeshi history is one long noble struggle of a Hindu people against various antagonists. Like all history, it's more complicated",
         "I was answering why people don\u2019t like India there.",
         "While I don\u2019t like engaging in whataboutism, but uhh that\u2019s a bit much coming from an Indian no? Indian mobs regularly kill Muslims by falsely accusing them of eating beef. Maybe you all should focus on your own country and leave the affairs of other countries to them?",
         "I do understand your point of reform. I'm just questioning the timing of reforms without taking care of the crimes against humanity taking place first. Don't make the mistake Americans made in Iraq where they focused on bringing in democracy without taking care of the more immediate problem of handling communal violence which left the country in ruins",
         "I don\u2019t think he is talking about the colonial times",
         "> Maybe you all should focus on your own country and leave the affairs of other countries to them?\n\nWhen India implemented the CAA (a legislation pertaining to fast-tracked Indian citizenship) to provide refuge to Hindus and other minorities facing a genocide in the Muslim-majority neighbouring nations, the islamic world (and other ignorant people) cried *islamophobia*. Now when Indians talk about the Hindus being targeted in Bangladesh, the very same people talk about *whataboutism*. Perhaps at the time of the CAA you all should have focused on your own country and left the affairs of India to Indians.",
         "Yeah that's fair - and given who's running the show now (Yunus and the rest) - they aren't Islamists of any stripe. \n\nI'm hopeful that they will take steps to address communal violence - but also think that the number one priority should be stabilizing the country post-Hasina - otherwise, the collapse of the Awami League basically leaves the islamists and the BNP as the only alternative, and they certainly don't give a shit about Hindu Bangladeshis and other minority groups",
         "When else would he be referring to with a comment about \"centuries\"? Bangladesh as a colony until 50 years ago, give or take",
         "Ah yes stability \n\nhttps://www.firstpost.com/world/bangladeshs-hindus-rally-against-violence-framed-sedition-charges-under-interim-govt-13831394.html/amp",
         "I'm sorry, but how does this contradict anything I said? If anything, it reinforces the fact that the situation in Bangladesh is still extremely unstable and in flux. Clearly the Bangladeshi government needs to do more to ensure stability.\n\nAlso, regarding this specific case - this was the result of a lawsuit brought by Feroz Khan, a leader of the BNP - very much not a member of the government"

Eventually when it became clear that diplomatic posturing wasn't going to accomplish anything, they moved to violence to try and get rid of the Jews. \n\nWhen that didn't work, they just occupied the land they said was supposed to be for Palestinians and took it for themselves. They only \"gave it back\" after Israel booted them out by force and they decided it wasn't worth directly fighting Israel anymore. Besides, by that point Palestine was filled with radicals whose sole purpose was fighting Jews, so why not \"support\" their \"resistance\" and claims to a state, let the Palestinians keep doing the fighting for them. \n\nOver time, most of these Arab countries either made peace with Israel, or got too embroiled in their own problems to actually bother with Israel, but the Palestinians have never known anything but that fight, so that's all they've got. \n\nThey brought that fight with them wherever they went. It got them kicked out of Jordan, and it kicked off the Lebanese civil war which led to the horrible state Lebanon finds itself in, unable to even control chunks of its own country that are infested by terrorists whose sole purpose is destroying Israel.",

Meaning that 3/4 of casualties are going to be wounded. A quarter of that 3/4 will return to duty within 3 days.\n\nSo a 4:9:3 ratio of RTD\n\nWith access to Iraq/Afganistan level medicine, that ratio is closer to 2:19:19 KIA:WIA:RTD\n\nFrom what we've seen, russia probably has some degree of medical aid, but probably not to GWOT levels (because fuck me western logistics are terrifyingly good.)\n\nVietnam is probably a good halfway mark. Vietnam had a 9:34:17 KIA WIA RTD and is what I'll assume for russian casualties. Please note this is a VERY rough estimate. With the fog of war, it's practically impossible to predict accurately, so I've used what I can from the data I have. \n\nFor example, russians have armour that they didn't have in 'Nam, and 'Nam had way worse medicine than russia now, which would contribute to less KIA. Buuuut 'Nam had way better casevac capacity and the ukranians weapon systems are much more effective than the VC's. This is, for all intents and purposes, an educated guess.\n\nBut anyways, using the nam ratio, of our 1200 troops a day, 180 are dying, 680 are becoming long-term wounded and 340 are marching straight back in using our somewhat conservative estimate\n\nIts worth noting of those long term injured, some will have things like second degree burns or broken bones and will likely return to the front in a month or so, others will have lost limbs or suffered brain injurys and will be gone for good, but thats not predictable.",

Calling their strategy \"Human wave offensives\" is falling for our sides propaganda.\n\nWhile russia does have its system of \"Expendable Infantry\" typically consisting of its penal batallions and conscripts from dontesk/luhansk that are used to skirmish with ukraine and find weak points in the line, as well as distract the ukranians so russian specialist troops can manuever (think mortars, snipers, artillery spotters and such). that's very, very different from a WW1 style human wave assault.\n\nBut even if it wasn't, the russians still have effective body armour, fire support, and access to things like tourniquets, modern clotting agents, and the likes.

         "For a little bit of background info. \n\n- France requested extradition in 2008 for the 1980 bombing\n- Was extradited to France in 2014 \n- Case was dismissed in 2018 after a judge found a lack of evidence \n- Hassan returned to Canada in 2018\n- In 2021 an appeal reversed the dismissal decision \n- In 2023 Hassan was convicted in abstentia\n\nThe evidence against Hassan are the following \n- Witness sketch that resembles Hassan\n- Hotel registration with handwriting that resembles Hassan\u2019s\n- A passport with Hassan\u2019s name was discovered in the possession of another terrorist \n\nHassan\u2019s defense\n- Fingerprint evidence that exculpated him was not admitted into evidence \n- He claims he was at a University in Lebanon when the attacks happened\n- The consensus of handwriting experts were inconclusive and that French authorities attempted to cherry pick favorable handwriting experts in order to get a conviction",
         "For anyone wondering about the legal complexities of this case, Diab was not actually implicated in the Copernic attack until 1999, 19 years after it took place, because he matched a description/police sketch. There was also a hotel registration form with handwriting similar to his, which has been analysed by multiple experts and different conclusions reached.\n\nHe was arrested in Canada in 2008 and extradited to France in 2014, and spent several more years in jail awaiting trial.\n\nThe article linked in this post appears to get some of the legal timeline incorrect - Diab didn't flee house arrest and go back to Canada; a French judge dismissed the charges against him in 2018. He was free to return to Canada according to [CBC reporting](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/charges-dropped-hassan-diab-1.4484443). \n\nThe dismissal of charges was overturned in 2021; there was no international arrest warrant issued at the time per the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/21/world/europe/paris-synagogue-bombing.html?smid=nytcore-android-share) and Diab was tried in absentia by a different French court. The case hinged on Diab's passport, which was seized in Rome in 1981 with a member of the PFPLO and showed entry and exit stamps for Spain, where the Copernic terrorists were believed to have fled. Diab had always maintained his innocence and that his passport was lost, and provided an alibi that he was sitting university exams in Beirut at the time of the bombing. The judge who dismissed the charges in 2018 found there was \"consistent evidence\" Diab was in Lebanon at the time of the Paris bombing.\n\nThere was also some exculpatory evidence - palm prints taken from a vehicle used in the bombing were not a match for Diab, and neither were fingerprints taken from an arrest record for \"Alexander Panadriyu\" - the alias believed to be used for the Copernic bomber, per the [Canadian Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/rp-pr/cj-jp/ext/01/p7.html) - this link provides a timeline of the case up to 2018/19. \n\nSo essentially, Canada is in the position of having already extradited a citizen once, that person having charges dismissed and being allowed to return, and essentially then being asked to extradite a second time (with no new evidence introduced in the case). Even more complicated is that Diab cannot appeal the conviction and life sentence in France because he was tried in absentia.",

         "The global economy is so bad even terrorists need second and third jobs, smh",
         "The Canadian Department of Justice has long held that Hassan Diab is being railroaded in an extremely weak case based on circumstantial evidence that has been contradicted by several eyewitnesses.\n\nYou can watch Senator Marilou McPhedran posing questions about Diab's during the October 9, 2024, session of the Senate of Canada.\n\nAn [independent report commissioned by the Canadian DOJ](https://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/rp-pr/cj-jp/ext/01/review_extradition_hassan_diab.pdf) reports that:\n\n*\"France\u2019s case against Dr. Diab was circumstantial. It rested primarily on five pieces of evidence:*\n\n* *A copy of Hassan Diab\u2019s old passport, which showed an entry into and exit from Spain close in time to the bombing in France*\n* *Witness statements from former friends of Hassan Diab\u2019s identifying him as a member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine*\n* *Eyewitness descriptions of a man using the pseudonym Alexander Panadriyu, who was clearly linked to the bombing on Rue Copernic*\n* *Composite sketches of Panadriyu and their purported similarity to contemporaneous photographs of Hassan Diab*\n* *A handwriting comparison analysis prepared by a French expert that concluded Hassan Diab was the likely author of a small number of words the fictitious Panadriyu had printed on a hotel registration card.\"*\n\nDiab was convicted in absentia by a panel of French anti-terrorism judges. France's criminal justice system is considered inquisitorial rather than adversarial (although French courts have adopted some adversarial elements), so he was convicted by a panel of anti-terrorism judges, without a jury trial (there was no guarantee that if Diab stayed to face trial, he would have been granted a jury trial).\n\nI don't know if Diab did it or not, but the Canadian DOJ has reasons to conclude that France did not follow Canadian standards of justice here, and it's standard policy for any country to refuse to extradite people on that basis. Israel, too, harbors Jewish terrorists who have been convicted in America.",
         "Charges were dropped in 2018 by a French judge for lack of evidence.  Diab then left France for Canada.  Then when the prosecutors in France appealed the case and Diab was convicted in absentia. Then France tried to extradite Diab.  At that point a Canadian judge determined that the charges should be dropped for lack of evidence.  So two judges, on French and one Canadian have dismissed the charges at different times.  Evidence includes eye witness accounts from back in 1980 and association with Palestinian Liberation organization which Diab denies.  I don't know.  Seems like a real shit show.  I'd have to look into the actual evidence.  Suffice to say two Judges determined there was a lack of evidence and the appeal had to be taken to the \"higher\" courts in France which are inevitably more political than the lower courts.",
         "It appears he was originally determined to be innocent by a French court:\n\n> On January 12, 2018 the charges against Diab were dismissed, after a judge claimed he found evidence for his presence in Lebanon at the time consistent. Two days later, he returned to Canada.\n\nAnd then he was convicted in absentia in a second trial with evidence that Canadian officials deemed insufficient.",

The decision to reinstate charges was a highly politicized process driven the families of the victims, and Canadian courts were already skeptical during the first extradition - and only reluctantly approved it - given how weak the evidence was.\n\n**FOR MORE CLARITY**\n\nIf you remotely look into this it becomes very clear that this entire trial and prosecution was a kangaroo court proceeding with a predetermined outcome, and he was right to not return to France.\n\n* The smoking gun from the French was \"handwriting analysis\" which has been heavily critiqued by experts and viewed skeptically by Canadian judges.\n* The French withheld fingerprint evidence from the defence that would have proven his innocence\n* He was literally not even France at the time of the attack, he has a rock solid albi (proven by university records) that he was in Lebanon writing his exams at the time.\n* After the first panel of judges dismissed charges (freeing him, therefore he was not a fugitive when he returned to Canada, after having years of his life taken over baseless charges) there was intense political pressure campaign by the families of the victims and NGOs to reinstate charges.)\n\n[Here is a better and more balanced article](https://www.cbc.ca/amp/1.6817944).",

I mean that part doesn't quite add up for me.  The passport showed the user had come in and out of Spain around the time of the attack, but if he was the one who used the passport, then why didn't he still have it in 1981?  How did it get from him to the other guy?  The thing is that due to racism, and how lax things were then, wouldn't it be easy for one Lebanese person to use someone else's passport in a European  country?

So they reopen the trail, find him guilty in absentia and dont even seriously attempt a extradition request.  That way when anyone or the Israeli government says Who did that Bombing?

There was also a hotel registration form with handwriting similar to his, which has been analysed by multiple experts and different conclusions reached.\n\nHe was arrested in Canada in 2008 and extradited to France in 2014, and spent several more years in jail awaiting trial.\n\nThe article linked in this post appears to get some of the legal timeline incorrect - Diab didn't flee house arrest and go back to Canada; a French judge dismissed the charges against him in 2018. He was free to return to Canada according to CBC reporting.\n\nThe dismissal of charges was overturned in 2021; there was no international arrest warrant issued at the time per the New York Times and Diab was tried in absentia by a different French court. The case hinged on Diab's passport, which was seized in Rome in 1981 with a member of the PFPLO and showed entry and exit stamps for Spain, where the Copernic terrorists were believed to have fled. Diab had always maintained his innocence and that his passport was lost, and provided an alibi that he was sitting university exams in Beirut at the time of the bombing. The judge who dismissed the charges in 2018 found there was \"consistent evidence\" Diab was in Lebanon at the time of the Paris bombing.\n\nThere was also some exculpatory evidence - palm prints taken from a vehicle used in the bombing were not a match for Diab, and neither were fingerprints taken from an arrest record for \"Alexander Panadriyu\" - the alias believed to be used for the Copernic bomber, per the Canadian Department of Justice - this link provides a timeline of the case up to 2018/19.\n\nSo essentially, Canada is in the position of having already extradited a citizen once, that person having charges dismissed and being allowed to return, and essentially then being asked to extradite a second time (with no new evidence introduced in the case). Even more complicated is that Diab cannot appeal the conviction and life sentence in France because he was tried in absentia.\"\n\nI think \"bona fide\" is probably a huge stretch *at best*",

I guess maybe the suggestion is that he lost it in the getaway by accidentally getting his stuff mixed up with another fellow terrorists belongings?

         "The first time he was tried, he was extradited on contentious evidence (dismissing 2 handwriting experts who ruled the handwriting evidence was inconclusive in favor of a third French expert who said it was conclusive).\n\nWhen he arrived in France, he was put in prison for 2 years with no jury date scheduled and then subsequently given \u201chouse arrest\u201d, which is a misleading description of being given an ankle monitor and forced to stay in a country you have no ties to.\n\nWhen his case was dismissed, he was still ordered to stay in France. Again this is effectively a form of imprisonment, one which he needed the aid of diplomats to escape back to Canada.\n\nHis alternative was to stay in his home country (where he moved to 30 years ago) and bank on its justice system protecting him via the Canadian extradition courts.\n\nIn essence, he had reason to believe that France was biased against him, that fighting the case might result in being stuck in France, potentially in prison, and that the French ruling would not matter if his own government protected him.\n\nAs of yet, he has not been extradited. Although his 2019 extradition trial review found no wrongdoing, it did bring to light many improvements that could be made (you gotta google this results of this one yourself - this is as far as my research went).\n\nPersonally, I believe this are compelling arguments for why he chose not to stand trial and would argue that his decision does not invalidate the argument that the retrial itself was unfair. I\u2019m not convinced of his innocence in its entirety but would argue that France\u2019s handling of his case was unfair.",

The French government might not have cared that this man could be innocent. They had to convict someone to continue the national theatre of safety. Paris thrives on tourism, and terrorists make travelers feel very unsafe. So convicting a Muslim man is more important than convicting the right man. \n\nThe reason why 9/11 was so terrifying is that it made us Americans face the facts and come to the realization that we weren\u2019t safe. We could no longer deny that terrorism came to our shores for the first time. (Timothy McVeigh was hand waved off as an insane white man who really wasn\u2019t a terrorist even though he was)\n\nSafety theatre was very important back then. The bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland changed a lot in aviation safety and airport security. The TSA was implemented after 9/11 as another method to make passengers feel safer. \n\nI went to England and France in 1997, and a lot of people told me they were terrified of traveling to Europe because of the risks of terrorism.

         "Meh, the real lesson is that Israel's ballistic missiles are much more precise. Air-launched probably has little to do with that. Correlation =/= causation. Israel uses ALBMs because the reusable aircraft increases range and throw weight for the same cost  of missile. But that requires an air force that can get somewhere without being shot down.\n\n  \nThe piece says\n\n>The advantage is that being air-launched, they can come from any direction.\n\nIran didn't get surprised by the direction. The boosters were found somewhere around Baghdad. But Iranian S-300 are incapable of intercepting the relatively small warheads that ROCKS and the other Israeli ALBMs have. You don't need a big warhead to take out an S-300 radar if you have accuracy down to a couple of meters. And then you've created a gap through which you can send in other planes old-school SEAD with cheaper, shorter-range missiles etc.\n\nThe not discussed topic there is that Israel managed to perfect anti-radiation ballistic missile warheads, which increase accuracy in such missions. There are some claims elsewhere (e.g. manufacturer's page) that ROCKS has such a warhead available.",
         "By the way, I've not seen imagery from the latest strikes on Iran's S-300s, but in the April one on Isfahan, it was pretty clear Iran always kept the radar on the same artificial mound they had built for it, to reduce ground clutter. So, even without an anti-radiation warhead that one was pretty easy to target with ballistic missiles.\n\n[https://isis-online.org/isis-reports/detail/assessment-of-israeli-strike-on-iran-near-esfahan](https://isis-online.org/isis-reports/detail/assessment-of-israeli-strike-on-iran-near-esfahan)\n\nIt would have been pretty stupid of them to have stuck with the same SOP after that, but who knows...\n\nIn Ukraine, Russia reportedly moves their S-400 vehicles like every hour or so, when in range of ATACMS. And even then, some got hit by ATACMS."

They more trainers and gear for new brigades, as well as infrastructure to sustain it institutionally. Russia has been zerg russian the front unsustainably (in the sense of their own casualty rates, hence norks coming in) because they always trying to pin and keep as many Ukrainians stuck on the contact line as much as possible for as long as possible, which, aside from attritioning the Ukrainian force, keeps veterans and skilled soldiers unable to rotate out to help train and lead new brigades or cardres because they are always needed on the front. The west is training in nato countries, but besides France (only one), Ukrainians are not getting trained with their full combat force (brigade) or with full equipment, because the stuff is needed in ukraine or on the line of contact and cannot easily just be transported back and forth across the european continent (logistically europe has fallen way behind compares to cold war levels of strategic mobility because everyone(a lot of people) thought russia was chill now.\n\nAs far as mercenaries go, all it would take to substantially increase ukraines ability to defend itself would be allowing contractors/western military people to enter into ukraine and help with logistics/training, with a massive available impact being if our governments allowed a \"flying tigers\" of maintainers and pilots to enter the country. But europe and others have been extremely strict in limiting the ability of available/existing western civilians/companies/militarily people to operate in country in any meaningful capacity, leaving just private individuals volunteering mainly, and defense industry companies have slowly started to set up production within ukraine, but that is not on the operational side of things.\n\nNothing is preventing \"foreign mercenaries\" from entering on the side of ukraine, like how russia has north koreans, Africans, Nepalese etc except foreign governments willingness to allow it or potentially aid in it setting it up. Russia, if you believe the applicable governments, is basically going into weak states and subvertingly recruiting foreign nationals and transporting them in, which ukraine could do too, but so far has not seemed to have done so at all, other than trying to call some of their diaspora/refugee male population to come back and serve. Poland announced they'd set up/train/equip a brigade in Poland, but they were only recruiting ukrainian citizen refugees that were in poland and knew about it and applied to join.\n\nNow for comparison, you can look at flying Tigers in wwii, china's technicalities to their involvement in the Korean war, Soviet/nork pilots involvement in Vietnam War, 7 days war (I think), and other similar occurrences. All that is to say that yes, if there was sufficient political will, anything is possible, and ukraine does accept \"foreign mercenaries,\" but they wouldn't operate independently and would have to join the Ukrainian army or defense intelligence branch to serve as a Ukrainian soldier under Ukrainian command in Ukrainian units of the armed forces.

         "> damnation is far worse than the death penalty.\n\nI think you will find that from a mainstream Christian perspective, God condemning someone to damnation for their sins is not nearly as bad as a human committing the sin of killing for any reason.\n\n>In the context of Jesus establishing his kingdom and damning people, it's quite reasonable to read it as literal administration of the death penalty.\n\nAgain, no it is not reasonable to take a literal reading of one section of a parable while the rest of the parable is metaphorical. Unless you think that in God's Kingdom, he'll literally leave for a while and literally give you a gold coin, expecting you to have made more gold coins by the time he gets back, at which point you'll literally be given some cities.\n\nJesus says elsewhere, while the death penalty is being administered, \"let he who is without sin cast the first stone\". This implies that the death penalty can exclusively be carried out by a sinless individual. This fits with a spiritual death penalty being administered by Jesus in his kingdom, but is completely incompatible with a human administering the death penalty. Therefore, the death penalty as a legal practice is condemned by Jesus' teachings.",
         "True. The context of the article posted is about Jesus condoning the death penalty as applied by humans.  the biblical verse you posted only shows that Jesus condoned the death penalty *when he applies it* in the apocalypse.",
         "When Jesus comes back to establish his kingdom, is he going to let the reprobates die of old age before damning them? And clearly being sentenced to a torture chamber for all eternity is worse than being executed.\n\n> Jesus says elsewhere, while the death penalty is being administered, \"let he who is without sin cast the first stone\".\n\nWell that story is of dubious provenance.",
         "Then I don't know what you were getting at. The point of my comment is simply to show Jesus's support of the death penalty. He said he himself was going to have people executed.",
         "> Well that story is of dubious provenance.\n\nSure, but it's not like something found exclusively in Luke is an ironclad example of something Jesus actually said either.\n\nThe Sermon on the Mount also has themes of people (unlike God) being incapable of properly judging and punishing crimes.\n\n>being sentenced to a torture chamber for all eternity is worse than being executed.\n\nAgain though, what matters is who does the sentencing. I assume that Jesus would probably have agreed that God could carry out the death penalty all he wanted, just as God can condemn people to whatever punishment he sees fit. But Jesus would absolutely reject the idea of simple human-run governments administering the death penalty, and there is no evidence to the contrary."

         ">  It\u2019s a little frustrating how much permission Ukraine needs to do anything, while the Russians are playing to win. \n\nIt's a genuinely difficult position to be in. When they disarmed their nukes - we promised we would *defend them*. Not allow them to go on the attack. That difference is important. And we did come to their aide - and now the curtain has been revealed Russia isn't all we thought it was.\n\nBut make no mistake - countries considering nukes are watching this and paying close attention. Nukes **ARE** a deterrent. And with nukes also means you don't need others permissions - so you can go on the attack *if* you have the military power.\n\nWe've given Ukraine a solid amount of military power with the rule they don't use it \"wrongly\" kind of wording. So they basically have to keep asking permission. \"Can I use it for this?\" and the careful thing is.. if we say \"fuck it, do whatever\" - we will have declared war on Russia by proxy. Expect the natural consequences to come forth - which will be Russia just saying \"fuck it\". And I doubt anyone *knows* what will come out of that.\n\nHow is it possible you don't know these things and yet are also frustrated. It feels like even a moderate level of looking into it would have enlightened you.\n\n>  while the Russians are playing to win. \n\nSit and think about this for more than the half second it took you to write it. If Russia is playing to win... and Russia is being held back with a small fraction of our, and a few others, military might. What does that really say about this war? What does it say about Russia? It says either they aren't in it to win it.. or they lack the resources to *actually* steamroll Ukraine. Even *if* the former were true at the start, the latter took over once the sanctions and such happened.\n\n>  and its unwillingness to commit is a show of weakness.\n\nNo, it doesn't. We see Russia without using nukes is weaker than we thought. We're still unsure where there nuclear capabilities are though.\n\nWith the amount of sanctions Russia has - the \"rich\" of Russia are *not* happy right now. This is no small thing. Russia is not doing well economically. Russia pushed Europe, as a whole, to want to get away from Russian oil. These are long-term damning actions. Make no mistake - Russia. Is. Fucked. The only *real* answer is going to be for Putin to exit and Russia to be reformed. I can't imagine any other answer that the world will accept and will also save Russia.\n\nI'm, in no way, saying Ukraine doesn't need help.

This is weakness.

The other candidate wants to follow the current policy of losing the war slowly because a good part of the electorate following her wants to capitulate as well.\n\nWe need to recognize that all of these people will still vote during a war and will vote against war because everyone's life will end up supporting the war effort if we decide to win the war. There is one priority during war, the war, all other political considerations need to be set aside. The economy will be upended, there will be rationing, people will be conscripted.

         "> Are they fucked? Far from it.\n\nMy dude, there is not healthy path to recovery from them currently. That is my definition of *fucked*.\n\nLet's assume they say \"my bad\", gives back Ukraine all they took, and even pays back any and all costs **RIGHT NOW**. The sanctions were no joke. The rich had many things taken from them that were outside of their country. Europe is migrating away from Russian oil dependence - which, alone, is **huge**.\n\nEveryone alive in Russia right now is not likely to lead a happy life for *decades*.\n\nThen to make matters worse - very few are going to trust Russia. Recovery is going to be excruciatingly painful. The rich have lost a lot of influence they once had. \n\nLet's be clear: Europe wants off Russian oil and gas and this has expedited that. That's *fucking massive*.\n\n>  Russian economy is growing\n\nSure but this growth is not sustainable for any real length of time and when it goes out, not if but when, the house of cards will fall *very* quickly and then things will get **NASTY**.\n\nThis \"growth\" you're referring too is similar to the US in WW2. Do you know what this is fueled by? (pun intended)\n\nEvery single year, literally, Europe requires them less and less. Their main \"friends\" are North Korea and China. These are not good long-term indicators.\n\n> Are they fucked? Far from it.\n\nI should elaborate - I'm referring to their future. They fucked up. There is no path to success after this very temporary boon. Europe won't need their oil or gas. China will catch up and not need it either. North Korea has limited resources. The Middle Easy will be their next best friends - and that will been a tenuous relationship, at best, because they know good and well they might be target number one next for the resources.\n\nAnd the US will absolutely come to the defense there for the same reason we did it 20 years ago. It had fuckall to do with Sadam.\n\nYou aren't going to find many people who are going to say \"sure, it's unpleasant now but just you wait - Russia will at least be average after this\". Ain't no one investing in *anything* Russia. Their claim to military might is laughed at. Their power of ... power (heh) is going to be lost soon enough.\n\nSo... what are they going to produce? China, Taiwan, SK, and Japan will dominate them in every useful way. There does not appear an out in which they are not fucked in 30 years. They will have nothing to offer.\n\nThey killed off so much of a generation *already* that in 20-40 years time it's going to be quite unpleasant. We've seen how that goes (WW2 anyone?).\n\nTheir only hope is if they can come up with something in science to put them on the radar again - but after what's going on now that's at *least* 3-4 decades out.\n\nThe only potentially scary thing is.. if it all craters.\n\n>  Russian population is not lining up for food stamps\n\nThis is literally one of the only reasons they aren't in a civil war right now. \n\nFunny enough, it's the same reasons most folks in the US who claim to want a civil war never actually do it. (See: Jan 6 and how half ass that was). They knew good and well they have everything to lose.\n\nSo if you put a generation that has no future and as long as they aren't hungry and have a few trinkets - they won't revolt. When the war economy crashes, and it will, things will sour very fast. History has shown us this time and again and again and again.\n\nAnd civil wars are never pretty.",

Neither am I saying the individuals in the country are cowards as a whole, individuals are separate and district from the countries they are citizens of. I'm trying to see reality clearly, not offend.\n\nYou can be certain that other countries in the world see our actions in the West and see our unwillingness to defend our interests and are acting against our interests in our moment of apparent weakness.\n\nNorth Korea, for instance, feels safe to develop nuclear weapons, to send their military to directly combat our interests in Europe because they believe we won't act to defend our interests. Russia has also been attacking Western interests in Africa and the Middle East alongside Iran. why do they feel secure in doing this? Because they see our unwillingness to defend ourselves.\n\nIn every action the West has taken for a long time we show that we are unwilling to defend ourselves when we are attacked, not just in Ukraine, but everywhere. In Iraq and Afghanistan we showed we were willing to start a war but also that we were unwilling to win the war. We were willing to impose cost on an adversary but not win a war. Clausewitz said that the goal of the war isn't to stop death, but rather to enforce your will on another through any extreme you are capable of and the side that is less willing to take the extreme method is put at a disadvantage, which is what we see repeatedly. We can fight wars seemingly indefinitely because we have such great capability but we are unwilling to use it to the extreme necessary to, as again, Clausewitz puts it: make resisting our will worse than submitting to it. We can see that our (much weaker) adversaries will has been imposed on us repeatedly because to us and our value system our resistance to their will was worse than our submission to it (take Afghanistan as an example, we fought the Taliban for decades but in the end we submitted to their will and left, they showed resistance to our will was better than submitting to us and we showed the opposite)\n\nIn the West we have this idea that offensive, tough, uncomfortable, ... ideas shouldn't be discussed because we don't like the conversation but this is weakness too, the world isn't a pleasant place, we cannot be passive and expect to maintain our position. It's not personal, I'm not saying people who aren't currently fighting are bad and cowardly, I'm taking a step back and trying to see our actions as the world would see them, not have a vain conversation about our personal bravery. You're not trying to have a conversation with this post, you're trying to shut down a conversation because you're offended by it. I think you should consider whether that benefits you or your country.\n\nRecognizing your own weakness is the first step to addressing it, it's not personal, I'm trying to have a conversation about a perceived weakness, if you think I'm wrong I'm interested in an argument disputing it",

Korea. If we give a full approval to use US/NATO weapons against N. Korean soldiers on Russian land; both Russia and N. Korea will most likely declare war against the US. That means missile strikes against the west coast, US troops deploy, and NATO's article 5 is triggered causing deployment of other NATO allies.

Like what kind of mental gymnastics are we doing here? Lmao\n- There was an ongoing war - GWOT/OEF was still continuing in Afghanistan. The former president facilitated a meeting with the Taliban, despite most experts who warned against it including chiefs of staff and national security advisors, to negotiate our withdrawal and then dumped it on Biden to clean up with little details.

Of course COVID took that economy into a tailspin.

At some point we will run into a position where global trade is dominated by our adversaries and where we won't have the choice, if they choose to make us submit to their will we will have lost the capability to resist them.\n\nI'm not making an argument about where democracy goes to die, and I honestly don't think it matters in the current context because I think it much more likely we have a political system forced on us rather than making any choice on the matter, who's to say what that potential power may decide is best for us to have.\n\nI agree, we've had a lot of failed intervention, this is because we lack the will to win, because our system of values prevents us from the extreme that our adversaries use to their advantage.

I recommend Clausewitz's \"on war\" to understand what war is, our capabilities don't define war, our willingness does, war is fluid and our willingness to defend ourselves is much more important today than our capability is because we have all the capability necessary to maintain our position.\n\nThe United States doesn't support Ukraine to defend Ukraine's sovereignity, the United States supports Ukraine to maintain our system of law and order in the world, the keep trade lanes open, minerals flowing in a direction that maintains ourselves and empowers us to protect ourselves.

         "Lets looks at Umberto Ecos 14 common features of fascism and you tell me which of these do not appear in the AfD \n\n* *The cult of tradition. \u201cOne has only to look at the syllabus of every fascist movement to find the major traditionalist thinkers. The Nazi gnosis was nourished by traditionalist, syncretistic, occult elements.\u201d*\n* *The rejection of modernism. \u201cThe Enlightenment, the Age of Reason, is seen as the beginning of modern depravity. In this sense Ur-Fascism can be defined as irrationalism.\u201d*\n* *The cult of action for action\u2019s sake. \u201cAction being beautiful in itself, it must be taken before, or without, any previous reflection. Thinking is a form of emasculation.\u201d*\n* *Disagreement is treason. \u201cThe critical spirit makes distinctions, and to distinguish is a sign of modernism. In modern culture the scientific community praises disagreement as a way to improve knowledge.\u201d*\n* *Fear of difference. \u201cThe first appeal of a fascist or prematurely fascist movement is an appeal against the intruders. Thus Ur-Fascism is racist by definition.\u201d*\n* *Appeal to social frustration. \u201cOne of the most typical features of the historical fascism was the appeal to a frustrated middle class, a class suffering from an economic crisis or feelings of political humiliation, and frightened by the pressure of lower social groups.\u201d*\n* *The obsession with a plot. \u201cThus at the root of the Ur-Fascist psychology there is the obsession with a plot, possibly an international one. The followers must feel besieged.\u201d*\n* *The enemy is both strong and weak.\u00a0\u201cBy a continuous shifting of rhetorical focus, the enemies are at the same time too strong and too weak.\u201d*\n* *Pacifism is trafficking with the enemy. \u201cFor Ur-Fascism there is no struggle for life but, rather, life is lived for struggle.\u201d*\n* *Contempt for the weak. \u201cElitism is a typical aspect of any reactionary ideology.\u201d*\n* *Everybody is educated to become a hero. \u201cIn Ur-Fascist ideology, heroism is the norm. This cult of heroism is strictly linked with the cult of death.\u201d*\n* *Machismo and weaponry. \u201cMachismo implies both disdain for women and intolerance and condemnation of nonstandard sexual habits, from chastity to homosexuality.\u201d*\n* *Selective populism. \u201cThere is in our future a TV or Internet populism, in which the emotional response of a selected group of citizens can be presented and accepted as the Voice of the People.\u201d*\n* *Ur-Fascism speaks Newspeak. \u201cAll the Nazi or Fascist schoolbooks made use of an impoverished vocabulary, and an elementary syntax, in order to limit the instruments for complex and critical reasoning.\u201d*",
         "How are they neonazis? How are they fascists? Should I pull up Mussolini's definition of it?\n\nI'm not saying these people aren't reprehensible. But by calling everything mildly nationalist \"fascist\", you're just degrading the term to a common insult, detracting attention from those that are ACTUALLY fascist. I mean for God's sake their leader is a lesbian. You think she's admiring Hitler and Mussolini for their progressive views on homosexuality?",
         "Sure, you can say that the banned element has ultra nationalist tendencies. You can even say that AfD has xenophobic, nationalist, reactionary, etc whatever views. But fascism isn't just \"these people don't like these people\" or \"I think this person is racist\" or whatever. It's a political system built upon corporatist ideals (as seen in Mussolini's Italy, Franco's Spain, and Salazar's Portugal (Estado Novo)).As much as it's a political system, it's an economic system as well, with aspects like a dirigiste economy, among others. Notably, Nazi Germany can't really be described as fascist from these standards, nor can Imperial Japan. Which obviously doesn't detract from the atrocities they committed, nor does it give any justification to their histories.\n\nI'm not saying these guys aren't reprehensible, I'm just saying that they aren't definitionally fascist. Calling everyone and everything that's bad \"fascist\" just degrades the term to an unknowable meaning of \"whatever I don't like\".",
         "I'd rather take the definition from Mussolini himself. If you need me to, I'll dig up some of his old essays.\n\nI'm not saying that these people aren't reprehensible, but by defining everything mildly nationalist as fascist, you're just degrading the term to a common pejorative, which detracts attention from those that are ACTUALLY fascist.",
         "Saying that a lesbian can\u2019t be a fascist is a great way to demonstrate that you don\u2019t know what fascism is.",
         "> But fascism isn\u2019t just \u201ethese people don\u2019t like these people\u201c or \u201eI think this person is racist\u201c or whatever. It\u2019s a political system built upon corporatist ideals (as seen in Mussolini\u2019s Italy, Franco\u2019s Spain, and Salazar\u2019s Portugal (Estado Novo)).As much as it\u2019s a political system, it\u2019s an economic system as well, with aspects like a dirigiste economy, among others. **Notably, Nazi Germany can\u2019t really be described as fascist from these standards, nor can Imperial Japan.**\n\nThere\u2019s seems to be a small line between fighting over semantics no one called for and nazi apologist talking points. You crossed it. \n\nStop making up your own definition for fascism. There is no universally accepted definition and it refers to single movements (Italy) as well as it functions as a broader term for different authoritarian nationalist movements that check certain boxes.",
         "oh sure, why don't we ask the AfD if they're fascist. Mussolini doesn't have the last word just because he was part of the movement that made fascism popular. Language is mostly descriptive. Words mean what the most people think they mean.\n\nActing like a duck can be called fascist and it would be correct if english speakers adopt the terminology.\n\nThere are multiple past regimes we call fascist and people emulating them can rightly be called fascist no matter how they stand with Mussolini.",
         "(also Fascism) an extreme right-wing political system or attitude that is in favour of strong central government, aggressively promoting your own country or race above others, and that does not allow any opposition\nhttps://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/fascism",
         "Mussolini has the last word because the man (and Giovanni gentile) invented fascism \ud83d\ude02 \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 \n\nFascism has no actual meaning anymore istg",
         "The person doing a thing isn't always the expert in it, and your personal preference for a different definition that allows you to cast these people in a different light doesn't change reality. They are fascists.",
         "Mussolini did not found the first fasci, he simply popularized them. The whole movement already had a political ideology before he joined. It's like saying Steve Jobs invented tablets. He also shaped what you want to exclusively call fascism. Which is more correctly called Italian or classical fascism.\n\nFunny how you have no rebuke to my claim that language is descriptive and changes with the people using it so you have to simply deflect and distract. Common strategy though as confronting your inner beliefs is hard, so don't feel bad about it.",
         "Then by which foundational tenant of fascism can these AfD people be described as such?\n\nAlso, if language is fluid, all that does is prove that there's no actual definition being used here. Fuck it, everybody's fascist now, I guess."
