Nor would we ever honor it. \n\nIf Russia, as a state actor, could be proven to be doing it, then you\u2019d have a point. Absolutely could be, or this could just be random Russian people doing it because it\u2019s fun. Either way will never know because all it takes is a burner phone - if that.",

If we're gonna pick a fight with Russia we should damn well do it ourselves instead of hiding behind a nation a fraction of our size and military might like some kind of cowards.",
         "Biden has reportedly threatened Russia with massive cyberattacks if they interfere in our elections again. So we might very well see some retaliation - though the nature of cyberwarfare is such that it might not be very visible. \n\nPutin is probably hoping that a Trump win would cause all that to go away, since Trump is so submissive to Russia.",

This was according to Putin IIRC, which could be a complete lie. \n\nBomb threats that can be traced back to Russia is a little amateurish IMO, but I don't know anything about Russia.

Translation \u2014 Russia used the Internet to fool American voters and hackers to attack Democratic computer networks.\n>- According to Mueller's report, the Russian campaign began in mid-2014. That's when the employees of what's known as the \"Internet Research Agency\" first came to the U.S. to gather the material that they would later use in their elaborate interference campaign.\n>- By the end of 2016, the Russians had set up fake social media accounts that reached millions of voters aimed at promoting Trump or dividing Americans.\n>- The Mueller report lays out how the Russian interference campaign ensnared real American political operatives, including the Trump campaign and its allies.\n>- For more than 100 pages, Robert Mueller lays out scores of Russian contacts with the Trump campaign or the Trump presidency.\n>- According to the report, Russian agents also posed as American citizens and tried to communicate with the Trump campaign to ask them for assistance. \n>- Despite the reports conclusion, Mueller writes that, \"there were numerous links between the campaign and the Russians, that several people connected to the campaign lied to his team and tried to obstruct their investigation into their contacts with the Russians.\"\n>- WikiLeaks contacted the Russians privately on Twitter, saying: \"If you have anything Hillary-related, we want it in the next two days preferable.\" And then, on July 22, three days before the Democratic National Convention began, WikiLeaks released more than 20,000 emails and other stolen documents. It was a clear attempt to embarrass Clinton and weaken her candidacy.\n>- In 2013, Donald Trump takes his Miss Universe Pageant to Moscow. The Mueller report points out, this is how the Trumps got to know Aras Agalarov, a Russian billionaire and ally of Vladimir Putin. He owned the event hall where the pageant was held.\n>- Things start moving pretty quickly. Within a few months, Donald Trump Jr. signs a preliminary agreement with Agalarov's company to build a big Trump Tower property in Moscow. Trump announces his run for presidency in 2015.\n>- Mueller points out that, three months later, a new effort to build the Trump Tower in Moscow begins, this time led by Trump's lawyer, Michael Cohen, and developer Felix Sater.\n>- Meanwhile, Felix Sater tells Michael Cohen he's working with high-level Russian officials. He emails Cohen, saying, \"Buddy, our boy can become president of the USA, and we can engineer it. I will get all of Putin's team to buy in on this.\"\n>- The Moscow Trump Tower project is just one source of Russian contacts. Mueller outlines about a dozen of them in total. They vary widely.\n>- Campaign aide Carter Page meets with Russians and gives a speech in Russia. \n>- Michael Flynn gives speeches in Russia and has numerous contacts with the Russian ambassador, including a discussion of softening sanctions.\n>- Foreign policy and national security adviser, Jeff Sessions, also meets with the Russian ambassador.    \n>- Campaign chairman Paul Manafort regularly shares internal polling data with a man tied to Russian intelligence.\n>- Fellow Trump aide George Papadopoulos repeatedly meets with a different man connected to Russian intelligence, who tells Papadopoulos the Russians have dirt on Hillary Clinton.\n>- Another contact point was the infamous New York Trump Tower meeting on June 9, 2016. That morning, Donald Trump Jr. tells colleagues he has a lead on negative information about Hillary Clinton. Russians pitched the meeting to Trump Jr., claiming they had dirt on Clinton. Trump Jr. responds, \"If it's what you say, I love it.\"\n>- On Page 77, Mueller writes: \"The acting attorney general appointed a special counsel on May 17, 2017, prompting the president to state that it was the end of his presidency.\"\n>- The Washington Post revealed that the president is under investigation for obstruction of justice. According to Mueller, three days later, President Trump tells White House counsel Don McGahn to call acting Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to say Mueller has conflicts and can't serve anymore. The president says Mueller has to go. McGahn doesn't comply.\n>- Mueller outlines in the report that Trump was found to have obstructed justice at least ten times\n>- Mueller chose not to indict due to the DOJ and Bill Barr's insistence that a sitting president cannot be indicted.\n>- Another serious charge about the president is that he tried to block Mueller from investigating him or his campaign.\n>- On page 89, Mueller writes: \"Substantial evidence indicates the attempts to remove the special counsel were linked to investigations of the president's conduct.\"\n>- On Page 97, \"Substantial evidence indicates that the president's effort to limit the special counsel's investigation was intended to prevent further scrutiny of the president's and his campaign's conduct.\"\n>- the investigation led to the indictments of 34 individuals\n>- Trump's campaign staff presented themselves as \"attractive counterintelligence vulnerabilities\"\n>- The steel dossier had nothing to do with Mueller's findings. In fact, the first probe began prior to the steele dossier being released and the investigation began in response to Russian cyber attacks on the DNC (find her emails!), and intel describing a Russian plot to reach out to the Trump campaign and provide information on Clinton.\n>- Trump encouraged Russia on national TV to engage in cyber attacks against Democrats. \"Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing.\"\n>- within five hours of candidate Trump saying those words, Russians largest foreign intelligence service targeted Clinton's personal office for the first time\n>- Both Rick Gates and Michael Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI \n>- Roger Stone was charged with obstructing and lying to Congress about his contacts and the release of documents stolen by the Russians.",
         "If there's no collusion, how is there still a \"russian\" part? This is a genuine question. Do you think Trump isn't necessarily colluding but welcomes foreign interference? \nI wouldnt put it past him to be fair, but i also haven't seen any evidence that's the case.",

It's as if reality holds no grounds anymore. Go visit Iran (as many YouTubers have) and then make YOUR OWN decision about their culture, lifestyle and/or how oppresive it is. \n\nIn regards to women and being safe. The more Islamic a country's government is and the more they prescribe the \"headscarf\" (the thing Mother Mary wore), the less rape and sexual assault occurs in the country, because, the sole reasons of the headscarf  is that it is mandated by God and that it is to protect a women's chastity \u2014 we know how women get treated when they show their bodies off and objectify themselves. \n\nA woman is more likely to get assaulted in England, France, Namibia, The U.S, Sweeden or Botswana than she is in Iran, Saudi Arabia, or Afghanistan (the only countries that have MANDATED the headscarf). Out of the top 50 countries with the highest rates of rape only 4 are \"headscarf wearing ones\" (Pakistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Turkey). In other words, a woman is safer in a headscarf wearing country than in a non headscarf wearing one.\n\nThe reason a woman might feel \"oppressed\" is because she wants to show her self off, or doesn't believe in what God has mandated, it's simple. Now, should women be allowed to dress in booty shorts if she desired, or be legally forced to cover herself up in public is the debate to have. Using the \"safety\" argument is a misnomer.\n\nDon't be biased, be fair.",

This was the chance to rebuild trust between the two nations. The fallout of Bush winning the 2000 are still with us\n\n> Iranian president Mohammad Khatami and Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei condemned and denounced the attacks and the terrorists who carried them out. Iranians who gathered for a soccer match in Tehran two days after the 9/11 attacks observed a moment of silence. There was also a candlelight vigil. Huge crowds attended candlelit vigils in Iran, and 60,000 spectators observed a minute's silence at Tehran's soccer stadium. On Tuesday, September 25, in 2001, Khatami meeting British Foreign Secretary, Jack Straw, said: \"Iran fully understands the feelings of the Americans about the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington on September 11.\" He said although the American administrations had been at best indifferent about terrorist operations in Iran (since 1979), the Iranians instead felt differently and had expressed their sympathetic feelings with bereaved Americans in the tragic incidents in the two cities.\" He also stated that \"Nations should not be punished in place of terrorists.\" According to Radio Farda's website, in 2011, on the anniversary of the attacks, United States Department of State, published a post at its blog, in which the Department thanked Iranian people for their sympathy and stated that they would never forget Iranian people's kindness on those harsh days. This piece of news at Radio Farda's website also states that after the attacks' news was released, some Iranian citizens gathered in front of the Embassy of Switzerland in Tehran, which serves as the protecting power of the United States in Iran, to express their sympathy and some of them lit candles as a symbol of mourning.",

This OSAT is the sanctioned party in this case. When the GF salesperson (or account exec, etc) attempted to validate that the OSAT was valid, the trade compliance software approved the transfer so it went through. It wasn\u2019t until a later audit where they found that the information for this particular OSAT was misentered into the system so when it should\u2019ve been blocked, it wasn\u2019t. At that point is when GF notified the regulators and agreed to pay the fine. \n\nThey don\u2019t say what the product was that was shipped, but GF isn\u2019t competing with the TSMCs of the world at the cutting edge nodes, so I think it\u2019s pretty unlikely that anything of extraordinary value was provided to the Chinese government.

For the \"big\" guys like Boeing or Lockheed Martin, it is usually straight forward stated somewhere on their Purchase Order - either in the form of a government contract number or other identifier.  Where we have to be more careful is at the 2nd level of contractors and distributors - they are obviously not the end user, and usually their customer is not either, so obtaining and screening the information becomes even more important, and time consuming.  \n\nOn a side note - this also clears up something I was wondering about.  Around this time last year GF had a recruiting ad out for a high level trade compliance role at a very aggressive salary - they were likely scrambling to show Commerce that they were taking action to beef up their compliance systems.",

For example, you could have a corporation that has been clean since the start, and then one department, does cross the line. You expect every new hire and every department to know about the illegal activity? No, it would be almost impossible for new hires to know and for other departments, the probability would be very low.\n\nOn top of that, employees might fear that if they report something, it might end up with the corporate death penalty, which means if they report it, it could end up in them losing their jobs. We already have to have laws on the books for whistleblowing already, where if the whistleblower receives reprisals, they can sue the company for those reprisals. And that doesn't always help out.\n\nThe only time that a corporate death penalty would be acceptable is if their whole business is built on illegal activity. Meaning they can not continue to function without the illegal activity. But we already have that essentially on the books already.",

Lots of people don\u2019t seem to use it though.

And the speed cameras there are VERY clearly signed with multiple warnings. Not sure if there are mobile cameras but I don\u2019t get worried about it there because you\u2019re safe if you go a couple of k\u2019s over by accident. The fixed cameras here are signed and in places where accidents are more common (in order to deter people from speeding in those places) but the hiding of mobile cameras in sneaky places - especially at the bottom of hills - just to catch people out who are otherwise driving safely really shits me.\u00a0",

But stealth shape is terrible for aerodynamics, and especially aircraft stability and control. That\u2019s where the software comes in, to compensate for the aerodynamic instability of the aircraft. In addition to all the weapon and countermeasure systems.",
         "Not just that. Those high tech avionics are needed because these planes often trade better flight performance for a little extra stealth. It\u2019s hard to make control surfaces for a stealthy fighter, for instance, without compromising the stealth. They have to make a lot of unconventional choices for their control surfaces as a result, which makes flying the plane without some kind of computer assisted control really difficult, basically impossible really. Plus, it gives a significant advantage to our pilots by allowing them to focus on other tasks by freeing up some of the attention needed to maneuver the plane. \n\nThe reality is that Russia is way way behind us in terms of knowledge on how to build planes with minimal RCS. They try to compromise for this a bit by building a larger aircraft that can accommodate more powerful radars so the Su-57 can, in theory at least, detect a threat long before it gets close enough to target the Su-57. However, against a proper stealth fighter like an F-22 or F-35, those aircraft would still probably get target lock and take down an Su-57 before they even knew what hit them, because it\u2019s basically invisible on radar, especially next to a monster like the Su-57 that sticks out on radar like a sore thumb. These planes are actually stealthy enough to sneak through radar contested airspace with relative ease, something the Su-57 could never do.",

They are catching up with their fighter jet engines slowly, even if their stealth tech still sucks. \n\nI think they were able to reach their goal with the engines of the Su-57 performance wise, but that\u2019s about as small as they could make them. And, as it stands, they are way bigger than the f-22s engines and require a lot more fuel. They still have an impressive thrust to weight ratio, but the fact it is bigger means you still have to carry more fuel and make the plane itself bigger to make room for all that. These things mean the stealth aspects of the design have to be that much better to adequately conceal the airframe from enemy radar. \n\nSo basically, as a stealth fighter, the Su-57 is a joke compared to the F-22 or F-35. But in a more general sense, like if we\u2019re talking air superiority or multirole aircraft roles, the superior stealth capabilities of these planes goes a long, long way. Even if the Su-57 is comparable in some physical performance respects, in many others, it has glaring weaknesses our planes either lack or have more advanced counter measures for \u2014 the fact that they are almost impossible to find, either from the air or from the ground, being the first line of defense.",

The limitations of 1970s computers is why it looks like it jumped out of an N64 game. \n\nThe USSR had plenty of brains and technology. Had it survived longer, it would have rushed to develop stealth jets when the F-117 and especially B2 were unveiled.

I also believe when he says the us has to put radar reflectors on their 22's and 35's to make them visible for peacetime operations.\n\nRussia has a history of massively overpromising what their planes can do and woefully underdelivering. I doubt the plane would even compete against the jets that are supposed to be its peers.",

This should be self-evident enough that you shouldn't feel the need to paint the missile as some pie-in-the-sky prototype of unproven worth.",

         "We already know f-35s can guide sm-6s fired from ships, so change out f15ex for super hornets as the missile truck and you have publicly shown technology that you want.   \n\nNow if you want to talk about what we have been shown. Can the Russians field enough su-57s for this to even matter?",
         "China: quick we'll just change one letter that way **nobody** will know we stole the tech!",

         "As a American, it\u2019s still my favorite plane from a foe, and probably the best plane the Russians produced. It was purely designed to take down the SR-71, and though it would have likely failed in its mission if it was finished in time, it\u2019s still a fascinating piece of Soviet Cold War technology.",
         ">This is nonstandard, highly misleading use of the word 'prototype.'\n\nThe only photos of Super Hornets carrying that missile are inert stand-ins, hence why I said \"prototype\".\n\nThe main point is that the F-15EX probably isn't able to carry and fire the missile.",
         "Not to mention, while the SR-71 only ever had a handful of airframes and was operated by one country, the AIM-120D is being used by multiple countries and there are thousands (?) of them. With so many operators and wide usage, if it has much more range than publicly stated, I expect to see it leaked in the Warthunder forums by now.",
         "Correct. So this capability probably doesn't exist right now.",
         "Well, that's pretty different from the initial claim of F-35 guiding missiles from F-15EX at targets hundreds of miles away, isn't it?\n\n>Can the Russians field enough su-57s for this to even matter?\n\nProbably not, but that's not what we're discussing.",
         "Lol",

         "American companies aren\u2019t immune to not understanding the design and manufacturing processes of other countries. \n\nLook at the Toyota system. Lots of American companies wholesale copied it, and it ended up with cascading production issues when supply chains were disrupted. Toyota understood their systems and knew where they were weak, and built stockpiles in critical goods.\n\nWhen you just copy something without understanding how and why it was designed you\u2019re going to have adverse effects.",
         ">The only photos of Super Hornets carrying that missile are inert stand-ins, hence why I said \"prototype\".\n\nYep - but, again, I think there are relevant facts *beyond* the two you presented, which are useful as everyone draws their own conjectures / conclusions:\n\nYes: (1) the photos of the AIM-174b have only shown us inert stand-ins, and (2) the missile has not been publicly acknowledged to have been fired from an F/A-18.\n\nBut also: (3) the U.S. Navy has confirmed that it is operationally deployed in its air-launched configuration, and (4) the missile itself has already been used [*in combat*](https://www.twz.com/sea/navys-sm-6-missile-used-in-combat-report) in its booster-motivated configuration.\n\nIn fact, I'd caveat (1): the \"CATM\" designation [we last saw](https://theaviationist.com/2024/09/11/f-a-18f-heavy-air-to-air-load-aim-174s/) taxonomically distinguishes it from Y-prefixed prototypes and X-prefixed experimental deployments. The C prefix means it's the captive (training dummy) version of a production missile.\n\n>The main point is that the F-15EX probably isn't able to carry and fire the missile.\n\nAgreed, although we must admit this is speculative. There would certainly be a lot of software work to integrate the SM-6 into the F-15's datalink / guidance systems, which are obviously different from the Navy's Super Hornets, but (to my admittedly thin knowledge on all this) I don't know that there's an outright incompatibility that would make this impossible.",
         "I definitely understand that, but the US has a habit of saving the best for ourselves. I would be highly surprised if we didn't have air to air capability touching on 200+ miles, we definitely do for certain platforms and applications (JASM-ER for example).\n\nPlus we already know the infosec issues with war thunder forums, and while most of the breaches on there were for classified info, they weren't really all too consequential of breaches IIRC. \n\nWe're talking air-to-air missiles, something I'm sure are a highly guarded secret, where only a select group of people know the true range (maybe not even the pilots themselves). It's simple to code in switches in tech to make sure the full features are walled off until someone gives the go-ahead. \n\nHowever, you're absolutely right on your original point. Focusing on publicly available knowledge is best, since it's all just idle speculation. I'll defer to you on this.",
         "Didn't claim it did. Just that our Eurocanard flying friends have enviable range with their neat-o cool guy throttling missiles. \n\nAlso, don't forget the AIM-260. According to Wikipedia, it's on schedule and expecting a \"some time in 2024\" production with a published range of 120 miles. It's F-35 compatible. \n\nWe also have the AIM-174B, fired from Super Hornets, with a published range of \"*at least* 130 miles.\"\n\nI'd say between these, we're doing just great against the Su-57.",
         "What jet gives the aim 174b a ride is irrelevant.  It's the capabilities of the missile and the f35 that make this possible. You're hung up on the least important detail",
         "Nah, they call it,  \u201cwe straight up stole the f35 designs\u201d35",
         "The drone market would like a word",
         "I am just saying that this talk about \"Chinese can only copy\" is similar to the pre-WW2 sentiment in USA and UK. This has caused many pilots to enter combat with superiority complex, fully confident in their own skills and machines. This has cost them their lives. Yes, maybe J20 is not great. But it is also possible that industrial espionage combined with domestic research allowed Chinese to build true state of the art fighter. Be prepared. Stay vigilant.",
         "I've addressed the AIM-174 and AIM-260 in another reply. The gist of it, is that the former is currently used by the US Navy, and the latter almost certainly isn't meeting the 2024 production claim.\n\nAs such, the capability of F-35 guiding missiles from F-15EX at targets hundreds of miles away, probably currently doesn't exist. It might become true in the next few years, but not as of right now.",
         "No I'm not, because the claim isn't \"F-35 can guide missiles\"; the claim is \"F-35 guiding missiles fired by F-15EX at targets hundreds of miles away\". I'm saying that it can't do that, because there isn't a missile available to the F-15EX with enough range to make it happen. And AFAIK, that is true."

That they're being send to fight another's war directly that doesn't involve their country? What about their family if they end up getting killed or severely wounded?",
         "No Ukraine doesn\u2019t actually have massive amounts of resources if it did it wouldn\u2019t be entirely dependent on the west to supply it with weapons and keep its economy functioning and to put it even more bluntly if Ukraine had massive amounts of resources there would already be a massive amount of American troops on the ground in fact they would have been there LOOONG before Russia invaded.",

         "Cool, then we don't have to worry about things getting out of control in Ukraine because of the threat of mutual destruction either.\n\nDo you really think Russia is going to opt for MAD just because it's denied victory in Ukraine?  That's no different from the Korean calculus.\n\nRussia has also done enough that NATO or the US could interpret as a declaration of war *should it so choose*.  Any rules are more like guidelines; there isn't some great machine that decides what counts or doesn't count.",

In an ideal would I would have NATO tanks rolling right up to the Russian boarder to kick them out of Ukraine but i know the geopolitical reality is  that's not an option. What I am expressing here is not an opinion its a geopolitical fact that as things stand NATO is not going to put NATO forces in contact with Russian forces. Don't hate on the messenger.",

         " Because it\u2019s clearly an act of war?",
         "How could it not. \nRussia launched a missile that was meant to hit a target in Ukraine. \nSome other country said nope. And launched AA missile from their territory and destroyed the missile in Ukranian air space. \n\nAnd you're saying Russia should just say. Ah well. Since the AA battery is not in Ukraine we wont touch it and will continue letting it shoot our missiles and planes?",

So if we consider it true that Russia considers it existential, then we must consider it only a first step before also moving into the Baltics and others, meaning NATO must also consider it existential.\n\nRelated to this, my \"shoeshine boy\" moment came very early on in the war, when Russia recognized things were going so well.  On that one Russian talk show, one of the guests was trying to rationalize why things were not really so bad, including \"...and there's been no intervention [by NATO]\".",

Have a good day.",

         "Its response was handled by diplomacy. And your example isnt valid. \n\nA Russian jet violated Turkish airspace. And Turkey had the right to attack the plane. \n\nHere we're talking about Poland shooting down missiles in Ukranian airspace. \n\nAnd if Russia doesn't escalate, what would stop NATO from shooting everything in Ukranian airspace? \nNATO could then make it so that no Russian missiles or jets fly in Ukraine, while at the same time enabling Ukranian fighter jets. And you're saying Russia would be fine with this?",
         "Turkey paid Russia billions and agreed to buy billions more in crap Russia military equipment and other imports. Turkey stopped letting the U.S. conduct air mission using Turkish airspace and stopped letting the U.S. supply American proxies overland from Turkey. All things Russia would have gladly traded 10 jets for. Russia got ALL that from Turkey for just because Turkey justifiably defended its own airspace."

         "\nIrans goal around Nuclear weapons is one of strategic ambiguity about whether they will actually get them. Their ideal strategic position to be in, is one where the world knows they could ramp up and get a nuke with a month or twos work, but not actually do that work and change the entire regions strategic balance and the chess board.\n\nIran is very aware that if it actually acquires nuclear weapons? If it actually becomes a nuclear power? It changes the entire game in the region, with Saudi Arabia and Turkey both acquiring nuclear weapons very quickly, Israel and the US getting very close to launching full scale campaigns against Iran to try put the genie back in the bottle, and Irans \u201caxis of evil\u201d friends China and Russia walking away from them (because none of the nuclear powers want new nuclear powers to appear. None.)\n\nBut Iran also wants the threat of it **could** get nukes to always be there, because it allows it to use that threat as a deescalation strategy whenever things start to heat up. And it keeps Iran relatively safe from direct interventions (their little exchanges with Israel recently not withstanding). It also lets Iran have the occasional \u201cnuclear deal\u201d or treaties with global powers where it can use the promise of not finishing its nuclear program to get a concessions it wants.\n\nWe know from Western, Russian and Chinese sources (which all largely agree), that Iran is technically at a point now where it is weeks away from having a nuclear device. It has been in this position for most of 2024. They could have half a dozen nuclear weapons by Christmas very easily if they chose to. They are choosing **not to**, because actually getting the weapon would be terrible for them, but the ability to get it is fantastic for them.",

         "Actually, one of them, the girl i liked who's boyfriend is heavily involved in the hack, even told me i wasn't crazy. She was a very nice person, and one of the only good people in that entire warehouse. Luckily for me I'm not the piece of shit they kept telling everyone i was, and when i first mentioned liking her in a  text to someone, i was very gentlemanly about it, even when that person asked several lewd questions. She was a good person.\n\nPlus, if you had lived the life I jsut had to live the past year and a half living, you would know it's not just a paranoid delusion either. In fact, i hoped and hopped and hoped it was just a delusion. Even after my mom's credit card got used for fraudulent purchases, and even after they started describing the inside of my house and bedroom to me to try to make me go crazy. I'm not joking. And i'm not the only person they've done it to. They do it to everyone. These fuckers have left a wake of victims in their path, i watched it go on for over a year. For over a fucking year I sat there and watched them do what they did to me to countless other people. The only difference between me and them, is that I figured out what was going on, and started fighting back. And i pushed their fucking shit in for over a year straight. Which then caused hte situation to escalate to where it's at now. Where stupid little15 year old girls are being arrested for making up heinous crimes, and the police have to set up camera sentry devices on my run route now.\n\nAlso, this happened at Amazon BTW. And the management, including hte top one, are all in on it. Either through complacency via threats of blackmail, or directly to profit themselves. Some also just use it to get rid of people they don't like. One guy there even got arrested for arson, and in the news article it said he got caught through cellular data, but knowing what i know now, i'd say that guy didn't do it. And i'd say the guy i got a protection order against is the guy that actually did it.",

This is a war of attrition. Make them poor enough and their own people will revolt and overthrow them. Im not saying dont touch russia at all to be clear, they\u2019re some bastards for sure.

Extended range of use of our weapons would be a measured and appropriate response. You can be a hawk or a dove.

         "> Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, responding to his dismissal earlier Tuesday, said that he was fired due to disagreements with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on key security issues. \n\n> In a special statement, Gallant said his firm stance that all Israeli youth must serve in the IDF, his push for the recovery of hostages, and his call for a national inquiry into the security failures that led to the events of the October 7 Hamas attack. \n\nLooks like the orthodox elements asked for a head to roll and that\u2019s where they landed. Netanyahu is not interested in serving the interests of Israel",

(This would have given Moscow veto power to override the defense mechanism. In addition, Moscow rejected a Ukrainian demand that guarantor states could establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine in the event of an attack.)\n* **Ukraine that should bear the costs of rebuilding the Donbas infrastructure**\u00a0destroyed since 2014.\n* re-legalize Soviet and communist symbols in Ukraine.\n\nLater, Ukraine declined further negotiations with Russia, particularly due to evidence of atrocities committed by the Russian army in Bucha.",
         "By \"early\" they're referring to February of 2022, when the Russians still thought they were gonna take Kiev. The Bucha massacrewas on-going at this stage of the negotiations. the terms are exactly what Putin said he wanted early in the War: Ukraine with an army too small to defend itself, permenently neutral so no access to Western weapons, large territories ceded to mother Russia, etc.\n\nSo bullshit demands issued while they were committing genocide.",
         "Sometimes I remember how they fought this to make Ukraine neutral and ended up flipping Finland and Sweden into NATO and have a sensible chuckle.",

Russia wanted to gain lands without a fight - that\u2019s why they launched a strike against Kyiv hoping that Zelenskyy will capitulate. But they underestimated Zelenskyy\u2019s resolve.\n\nWith such \u201cpeace deal\u201d it\u2019s obvious that Russia will invade again. Russia likely will make Ukraine to be one of its satellite states. Russia may then install some of its troops inside Ukraine to \u201cprotect Russian-speaking population\u201d just like what they did in Transnistria. With only 1/5 of her military it would be very hard for Ukraine to resist the second invasion.\n\nI would even say that even if Ukraine loses in the end, they have fought hard and bloodied Russia so many times. Russia now will realize that invading someone will send 100,000+ of their own people to their end, hopefully dissuading them and China for making such foolish endeavors. We didn\u2019t even go to the \u201cguerrilla\u201d phase yet when conventional army like Russia will suffer more losses - just like what SU and the USA faced in Afghanistan.",

         "PYONGYANG \u2014 In a historic but baffling display of power, North Korea has once again declared its hostility toward the Pacific Ocean, reportedly launching yet another missile barrage against what it calls \"the great blue menace.\" Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un has branded the sea an \"existential threat,\" claiming it was \u201chigh time we sent a message to the oceans who threaten our sovereignty.\u201d\n\nThis follows a series of missile launches that have repeatedly landed in the open water, all aimed at what state media describes as \"critical ocean targets.\" The targets, sources confirm, are mostly arbitrary patches of sea where fish and plankton may or may not reside.\n\nDuring a recent speech to a select group of state-approved journalists, Kim Jong-un emphasized that \u201cthe Pacific is an unforgiving enemy that has long been underestimated.\u201d He cited tidal waves, humidity, and saltwater corrosion as evidence of the ocean\u2019s relentless aggression toward North Korea.\n\n\u201cLet this be a message to all waters, rivers, seas, and oceans who seek to undermine the dignity of our nation. Our missiles will find you, no matter where you are!\u201d he proclaimed.\n\nMilitary officials in North Korea claim the ongoing attacks have successfully \u201cintimidated the sea into submission,\u201d though reports suggest that the sea appears unmoved. Satellite images show it continues to behave as it always has, indifferent to the nation\u2019s aggression, lapping peacefully against its shores.\n\nInternational analysts are, understandably, puzzled. \u201cIt\u2019s almost as if North Korea thinks the ocean has done something personal to them,\u201d said a bewildered expert from the UN. \u201cWhile most nations use missile tests to demonstrate technological progress or power, North Korea seems genuinely to believe it\u2019s in some kind of grudge match with the ocean itself.\u201d\n\nNorth Korean citizens, meanwhile, have been encouraged to \u201cshow their loyalty to the anti-sea campaign\u201d by boycotting seafood, avoiding swimming, and wearing state-issued armbands with slogans like Down with the Tide! and The Ocean Must Pay!\n\nIn a final show of defiance, the North Korean regime has promised to continue its anti-ocean campaign indefinitely, or until \u201cthe sea learns its lesson.\u201d As of now, the ocean could not be reached for comment.",

The goal of capturing Seoul is itself extremely optimistic given North Korea\u2019s hardware disadvantage.\n\nEven in a worst-case scenario where South Korea is alone and Russia is able to supply enough fuel and food to alleviate my point on North Korean resource shortages, North Korea is unlikely to meaningfully penetrate the DMZ, the South Korean air force *will* gain air superiority over North Korea in less of an air war and more of an air mass execution, and South Korea will destroy much of North Korea\u2019s government/military infrastructure and its Russian import corridor with cruise missiles and airstrikes.

On Tuesday, the Federal Office for Defence Procurement (Armasuisse) announced its proposal to purchase a new \u201cAGM Artillery Gun Module\u201d system one year earlier than initially planned.\n\n>Parliament will have the final say. It is not yet clear how much the new system will cost.\n\n>According to Armasuisse, other contributions for future purchases by the army are being prepared. In addition to the Piranha IV vehicles, the project includes training and simulation systems and an initial stockpile of ammunition.\n\n>Two manufacturers were in the running until the final decision: KNDS Deutschland GmbH & Co. KG, the Swedish company BAE Systems Bofors AB. After a detailed evaluation of the trials, clarifications and offers, the German system was chosen, Armasuisse said. This system had convinced with \u201cthe most favourable offer\u201d.\n\n>The new artillery system is intended for indirect fire support at medium range with precision and mobility. According to Armasuisse, only suitable systems based on a wheeled vehicle were considered. The 25-tonne Piranha IV armoured vehicle can avoid obstacles and mines.\n\n>The self-propelled howitzers currently in service will reach the end of their life at the beginning of the 2030s. They were procured in several lots from 1968 onwards and have formed the backbone of the Swiss army\u2019s motorised artillery ever since. Over the years, the system has been adapted several times for use.",

Refugees should not be entitled. If you want to impose on a host country to take you in, respect their boundaries of what they are willing to do. They are not obligated to take everyone who just wants to go to Canada, no matter the reason. It is up to them to decide."
