         "\nIrans goal around Nuclear weapons is one of strategic ambiguity about whether they will actually get them. Their ideal strategic position to be in, is one where the world knows they could ramp up and get a nuke with a month or twos work, but not actually do that work and change the entire regions strategic balance and the chess board.\n\nIran is very aware that if it actually acquires nuclear weapons? If it actually becomes a nuclear power? It changes the entire game in the region, with Saudi Arabia and Turkey both acquiring nuclear weapons very quickly, Israel and the US getting very close to launching full scale campaigns against Iran to try put the genie back in the bottle, and Irans \u201caxis of evil\u201d friends China and Russia walking away from them (because none of the nuclear powers want new nuclear powers to appear. None.)\n\nBut Iran also wants the threat of it **could** get nukes to always be there, because it allows it to use that threat as a deescalation strategy whenever things start to heat up. And it keeps Iran relatively safe from direct interventions (their little exchanges with Israel recently not withstanding). It also lets Iran have the occasional \u201cnuclear deal\u201d or treaties with global powers where it can use the promise of not finishing its nuclear program to get a concessions it wants.\n\nWe know from Western, Russian and Chinese sources (which all largely agree), that Iran is technically at a point now where it is weeks away from having a nuclear device. It has been in this position for most of 2024. They could have half a dozen nuclear weapons by Christmas very easily if they chose to. They are choosing **not to**, because actually getting the weapon would be terrible for them, but the ability to get it is fantastic for them.",

Our missiles will find you, no matter where you are!\u201d he proclaimed.\n\nMilitary officials in North Korea claim the ongoing attacks have successfully \u201cintimidated the sea into submission,\u201d though reports suggest that the sea appears unmoved. Satellite images show it continues to behave as it always has, indifferent to the nation\u2019s aggression, lapping peacefully against its shores.\n\nInternational analysts are, understandably, puzzled. \u201cIt\u2019s almost as if North Korea thinks the ocean has done something personal to them,\u201d said a bewildered expert from the UN. \u201cWhile most nations use missile tests to demonstrate technological progress or power, North Korea seems genuinely to believe it\u2019s in some kind of grudge match with the ocean itself.\u201d\n\nNorth Korean citizens, meanwhile, have been encouraged to \u201cshow their loyalty to the anti-sea campaign\u201d by boycotting seafood, avoiding swimming, and wearing state-issued armbands with slogans like Down with the Tide! and The Ocean Must Pay!\n\nIn a final show of defiance, the North Korean regime has promised to continue its anti-ocean campaign indefinitely, or until \u201cthe sea learns its lesson.\u201d As of now, the ocean could not be reached for comment.",

         "Key russian points on \"peace\" talks on \u00a0March 7, 2022:\n\n* Ukraine was offered \u201cnot to develop, produce, purchase, or deploy on its territory missile weapons of any type with a range of more than 250 km.\u201d\u00a0**The Kremlin would also reserve the right to ban \u201cany other types of weapons\u201d in the future.**\n* **Ukraine should reduce its army to 50,000 people,**\u00a0including 1,500 officers (five times less than Ukraine had by 2022).\n* **Recognition of the independence of the so-called Donetsk and Luhansk \u201crepublics\u201d**\u00a0within the administrative regions of Ukraine.\n* The\u00a0**lifting of all sanctions**, both Ukrainian and international, and the pullback of all international lawsuits filed since 2014.\n* All guarantor states agree to activate the assistance mechanism. (This would have given Moscow veto power to override the defense mechanism. In addition, Moscow rejected a Ukrainian demand that guarantor states could establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine in the event of an attack.)\n* **Ukraine that should bear the costs of rebuilding the Donbas infrastructure**\u00a0destroyed since 2014.\n* re-legalize Soviet and communist symbols in Ukraine.\n\nLater, Ukraine declined further negotiations with Russia, particularly due to evidence of atrocities committed by the Russian army in Bucha.",
         "By \"early\" they're referring to February of 2022, when the Russians still thought they were gonna take Kiev. The Bucha massacrewas on-going at this stage of the negotiations. the terms are exactly what Putin said he wanted early in the War: Ukraine with an army too small to defend itself, permenently neutral so no access to Western weapons, large territories ceded to mother Russia, etc.\n\nSo bullshit demands issued while they were committing genocide.",
         "Sometimes I remember how they fought this to make Ukraine neutral and ended up flipping Finland and Sweden into NATO and have a sensible chuckle.",
         "So basically, Russia gets everything they wanted and Ukraine gets nothing in return. \n\n  \nTop tier copium.",
         "The only way I can imagine Ukraine would accept being neutral is if Russia agrees to cede all territory seized since 2014 to prove that they don't have radical imperialist tendencies at the core of their foreign policy.\n\n  \nI don't believe that for a second though.",
         "I demand putins shriveled old balls in a small case. To be carried by the president of ukraine from now on.",
         ">*It reportedly called for Ukraine to shrink its army fivefold to fewer than 50,000 personnel and formally recognize Ukraine\u2019s Donetsk and Luhansk regions and Crimea as Russian lands*\u00a0\n\nJust one week earlier, putin declared to the World that they were not interested in land grabbing, just to denazify and demilitarized Ukraine.",
         "When I first read them, I was pretty surprised...surprisingly. Like, 50k troops max? 35k land troops? That's less than Belarus. Those terms were worse than Versailles and Compiegne, dawg.",
         "Pro-Russia propagandists keep insisting that Ukraine rejected the \u201cpeace deal\u201d because the West told them to.\n\nI can tell you that this \u201cpeace deal\u201d isn\u2019t a peace deal - it\u2019s Russia bullying weaker Ukraine to accept their demands. Russia wanted to gain lands without a fight - that\u2019s why they launched a strike against Kyiv hoping that Zelenskyy will capitulate. But they underestimated Zelenskyy\u2019s resolve.\n\nWith such \u201cpeace deal\u201d it\u2019s obvious that Russia will invade again. Russia likely will make Ukraine to be one of its satellite states. Russia may then install some of its troops inside Ukraine to \u201cprotect Russian-speaking population\u201d just like what they did in Transnistria. With only 1/5 of her military it would be very hard for Ukraine to resist the second invasion.\n\nI would even say that even if Ukraine loses in the end, they have fought hard and bloodied Russia so many times. Russia now will realize that invading someone will send 100,000+ of their own people to their end, hopefully dissuading them and China for making such foolish endeavors. We didn\u2019t even go to the \u201cguerrilla\u201d phase yet when conventional army like Russia will suffer more losses - just like what SU and the USA faced in Afghanistan.",
         "Russia is known to not keep its share of promises, is known to destabilize democracies in the west and is known to slyly making other foreign nationals fight in army. In short, they are nothing less than a terrorist state.\n\nMoreover, their list of human rights violations is too long to ignore and thus, they should not be negotiated with at all.",
         "Ukraine will never agree to this, because they literally already had a treaty in place with Russia that said Russia would respect Ukraines borders in return for Ukraine giving Russia their nukes.\n\nDo they really think Ukraine would fall for it a second time? Will Putin write \"but this time it is for realsies\" in the treaty?\n\nThe only way Ukraine can survive is if it is allowed to protect itself.",
         "Interesting that this is the \"great peace deal\" all the pro-Putins (including the useful idiots (including the whole \"peace now! at all costs!\" that is basically saying Ukraine should surrender and capitulate) as well as the on-the-nose rightwingers and MAGA in the west and beyond) have been bringing out as this gotcha! moment. It's only slightly less ridiculous than the later \"peace deal\" Putin offered. How predictable of that whole sphere of society.",

         "Pro-Russians like to make the talking point that Ukraine and the West rejected Russia's \"fair\" peace deal, but honestly after this masterful display of diplomacy I wouldn't blame Ukraine to tell Russia to go fuck themselves on any other subsequent \"peace attempts\".",

         "Russia and those that support them are clowns.  After the incendiary devices found yesterday, all range restrictions should be lifted and Ukraine\u2019s leadership should get a walk through of any non classified, non critical storage arsenal to pick what they feel they need to kick Russia back to 1500.  The difference between Russia and a terrorist state is the nukes, and unless we\u2019ve truly grown so spineless as to let them do what they want because they\u2019re willing to rattle their sabers, something will have to be done.",
         "Let's not forget that Russia published an [ultimatum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/December_2021_Russian_ultimatum_to_NATO) to NATO in December 2021. Ukraine is just a stepping stone and any \"peace\" will be just a stopgap to Russia's ultimate goals shared in the ultimatum.",

         "There was also a clause (buried in an annex) that allowed other states to defend this neutralized Ukraine on its own (since its own army would be gutted), which was also laughable, because the next time Putin invented some excuse to invade, it WOULD only take 2-3 days to take over this de-militarized state, so that any guarantor states (even if any would be insane enough to sign on to this joke of an agreement) would have to fight to undo a fait accompli.\n\n>According to multiple former senior US officials we spoke with, in April 2022, Russian and Ukrainian negotiators appeared to have tentatively agreed on the outlines of a negotiated interim settlement: Russia would withdraw to its position on February 23, when it controlled part of the Donbas region and all of Crimea, and in exchange Ukraine would promise not to seek NATO membership, and instead [Ukraine would receive security guarantees from a number of countries\u2026](https://twitter.com/BMarchetich/status/1564663207087804422)\n\nAnd we're all seeing what security guarantees like these (i.e., much like those given in the Budapest Memorandum) amount to right about now.\n\nAs for the rest, here's a [tweet](https://x.com/dszeligowski/status/1743975556289269913) that explains it pretty well, and mentions how the Bucha atrocities shut down the negotiations.",

         "key is \"likely\"...not discussing, not now, maybe discuss, maybe not , in other words who gives a shit about those Ukrainians hey NATO?",
         "They don\u2019t have to be a member of NATO for us to help defend them against missile strikes.  Especially over civilian population centers.",
         "From a defensive alliance standpoint it makes sense.  What if a drone or missile enters Polish airspace?  What if a drone or missile lands in Poland?  \n\nIm skeptical NATO will take it up but how do the Russians escalate if it's a preventative measure?",
         "About time.",
         "Orban will block it anyway even if Trump doesn\u2019t get reelected.",
         "Might get discussed but i highly doubt it will happen too much risk of escalation. \n\nNATO are in a sweet spot right now, Ukraine slowly bleeding Russia and they don't need to get involved this would risk direct NATO involvement, might require troops being deployed to sites to man these intercept weapons, could result in Russia targeting sites in Europe where these systems are being operated from. \n\nWhole thing raises the steaks too much for NATO so they can discuss it all the want but i don't think its going to happen.",
         "Exactly. Quit discussing it while people are dying. Just do it.",
         "I would like us (Sweden) to join Poland in implementing a no fly-zone over Ukraine. NATO or no NATO.",
         "The US - \"Hang on, I gotta flip a coin first...\"",
         "They need to wait to see if putins bitch crawls back into office first.",
         "And what about the aftermath? Like Russia isn't gonna let its missiles get taken down without consequences. \n\nAnd I doubt there is any EU leader that wants Russian missiles hitting European land or cities.",
         "uhmm wth are you talking about? Western Ukraine at least, russain send both drones nad all kind of missiles",
         "There is no need for his approval",
         "A few others will too like Slovakia or Slovenia",
         "Like, what escalation ? Russia is doing whatever they want anyway. \n\nI love the logic, Russia can drag North Korean in the war and it\u2019s all nice and good \n\nBut everything the west does is a dangerous escalation.",
         "Best 2 out of 3?",
         "I think Russia would fold. Even Russia couldn't seriously consider shooting down missiles an escalation, or at least enough for them to start bombarding European cities. That'd be an instant declaration of war against Europe, against NATO, against the US.",
         "Chamberlain-ish attitide.",
         "Suppose a country like Poland shot down a Russian missile over Ukraine. \n\nWhy is it a certainty that Russia will start hostilities against the nation that shot down its missile? \n\nIt\u2019s more likely that Russia would express extreme concern, send thoughts and prayers, etc.",
         "NATO acts on unanimous decisions. Hungary's approval is needed if they chose to intercept missles under the NATO banner.",
         " DRPK as going to have minimal to no effect, its more symbolic, its not really meaningful. \n\nSoon as NATO start doing this they then are taking an active role, all be it a defensive one. They would have to deploy NATO troops into the conflict zone to operate these weapons, they would have to set up logistical supply chains. Russia would see this as NATO getting directly involved in the conflict its a step in escalation that they could respond to by attacking NATO bases. \n\nNATO would be better sever ramping up the supply of air defence weapons would create a similar effect without the risk of winding the conflict. \n\nFor NATO directly using NATO forces to take out Russian missiles has zero advantage and lots of risk.",
         "Yea I don't follow the logic either. If the west supplies weapons, intel, training it's all nice and good. \n\nBut everything Russia does is a dangerous escalation.",
         "Considering how they're struggling with ukraine... Well, I doubt they'd be eager to open up a new conflict.",
         "Shooting Russian missiles in itself is a declaration of war against Russia by that nation. And thus there will be consequences. For example a couple of nukes into warsaw.\n\nThen it's up to NATO to react. Do they respond and Russia pulls the kill all switch. Or do they do nothing. \n\nI mean you're talking about a nation that has the capability to end all life on earth. And its nuclear doctrine says quiet clearly. If Russia is at threat of losing any potential conflict. It will use nukes. And those nukes will obviously be targeted at nato countries.",
         "It could be that. Or it could be not. You sure you want to poke the bear and find out?",
         "Nato could very well just operate the anti air systems from NATO territory and offer at least partial coverage, also the risk is purely for Russia, \n\nI find it bizarre to suggest that Nato is the one that should fear an escalation, Russia is the one that should shake in fear of such possibility, part of their propaganda is to make westerners fear the prospect of an escalation to avoid it. \n\nWhat is Russia going to do about it ? Cry ?",
         "You think russia is willing to die for a few missiles, or the world will just let russia nuke whoever they want. USA have world ending ability too. And China, India, French, etc.\n\nIf russia having the capability =  invincible, then what stops china from annex taiwan, japan, vietnam tomorrow? Or north korea from taking south korea? Waving around a nuclear weapon means nothing when others have it.\n\nBesides, are we certain Russia still have enough nukes? It takes a lot of $$$ to maintain them properly. Seeing the state of their military, I don't think so. (many old tanks/weapons with poor maintenance).",
         "Well I guess we should just let any nation with nuclear weapons do whatever  the fuck they want from now on then, right? Let North Korea take South Korea next I suppose, right?",
         "No, it really couldn\u2019t be not. But I\u2019ll bite:\n\nWhy would Russia open up a front against, say, Poland, in response to Poland shooting down its khinzals? To that end\u2026\n\nWhy would Russia launch missiles against *any* European city?  \n\nWhy are people so afraid of Russia that they will *literally do whatever Russia wants,* as long as Russia\u2019s request contains a thinly veiled threat of nuclear launch? Will you extend the same \u201ccourtesy\u201d to North Korea and Iran now that they have nuclear weapons of their own? At what point does it stop?",
         "I keep saying this on post like this. \n\nNATO does not owe Ukraine its salvation. \n\nSorry its brutal i don't like but NATO is not going to risk a direct war with Russia over Ukraine, its just not. \n\nWe need to be realistic, this is like the no-fly-zone....not happening, the line for NATO is NATO troops in contact with Russian's, this is exactly what it would mean for NATO troops to start shooting down Russian missiles. \n\nAnd yes...for this to be effective you would need NATO assets inside Ukraine.",
         "The only reason there is some sense of stability is the prospect of mutual destruction. This is why, generally, nations with nuclear weapons don't fuck about with one another.",
         "Wrong. North Korea can't do that because South Korea is protected by American nuclear umbrella. And because there is a threat of mutual destruction the north doesn't nuke the south, and the south doesnt invade the north.",
         "Well that's simple. \n\nIf Poland shoots Russian missiles it directly interferes with Russia's war efforts, thus automatically becoming directly involved in the conflict and becoming a side of the conflict. And Russia will retaliate. \n\nIts like saying why should US go to war against Germany in WW2 if all Germany did was sink British ships with American cargo destined for the UK? \n\nIt would launch missiles against AA placed in those countries. And as a consequence cities might get hit. Naturally Poland and NATO would hit back and we spiral into doomsday. Or Poland could hit a few missiles, then Russia destroys a couple patriot batteries and Poland calls it a day and we don't spiral anywhere. But if that the case, why even bother shooting a few missiles in the first place?\n\nWhy are they so afraid? Because Russia, like a handful of other countries on planet Earth, has the capability to destroy anyone and everything with a push of a button. And yes, the same courtesy extends to North Korea, China and the like. \n\n  \nNuclear weapons are a deterrent of aggression. Because if you attack anyone that has nuclear weapons you risk millions of lives. And not somewhere far far away, but on your own home soil. This is why USA and South Korea don't do anything against North Korea. Because if they do, there wont be any Koreas left. And other US allies might get hit as well. And then China might join the fun and its GG world.\n\nNuclear powers don't loose wars. Its as simple as that. And this is why directly engaging a nuclear power is suicide.",
         "It\u2019s literally to the Benefit of all western nations, this is not a charity project, but a geopolitical struggle against dictatorships. \n\nIn a world where dictators can do whatever they want and democracies cover in fear what do you think would happen? \n\nO wait, we saw what happened to Czechoslovakia, we saw what happened after it was given to a dictator, we saw what happened next, and yet you seem happy we make the same dumb mistakes again and again.",
         "Cold war is a thing, no? Such conflict had already happened multiple times. Russia can use dpr/lpr as proxy. Nato can use poland as proxy. And poland can use ukraine as proxy. Would be the same as conflict during cold way. Maybe even safer, considering the additional layer of proxy.",
         "Although in this case Russia is threatening mutual destruction if it's not allowed to do whatever it wants.",
         "Cool, then we don't have to worry about things getting out of control in Ukraine because of the threat of mutual destruction either.\n\nDo you really think Russia is going to opt for MAD just because it's denied victory in Ukraine?  That's no different from the Korean calculus.\n\nRussia has also done enough that NATO or the US could interpret as a declaration of war *should it so choose*.  Any rules are more like guidelines; there isn't some great machine that decides what counts or doesn't count.",
         "Could you tell me, why Poland\u2018s involvement in the conflict would be ***automatic*** if it shot down the hypothetical Russian missile?\n\nYou understand that\u2019s not how war works, right? It\u2019s not like some \u201cgotcha! Now we are in a war together!\u201c type shit happening here.",
         "Totally agree it is 100% in the wests interest to have Russia crippled unable to fight another war for a generation.\n\nIts also 100% in their interests not to get into direct contact with Russian forces for this reason they have to balance these two priority.\n\nAs such they're not going to start shooting down Russian missiles.\n\nTo be very clear or something just so there isn't any confusion. In an ideal would I would have NATO tanks rolling right up to the Russian boarder to kick them out of Ukraine but i know the geopolitical reality is  that's not an option. What I am expressing here is not an opinion its a geopolitical fact that as things stand NATO is not going to put NATO forces in contact with Russian forces. Don't hate on the messenger.",
         "I don't follow. NATO uses Poland as a proxy for what? \nIf Poland launches AA from its territory, AA will become a target for Russia's attack. Doubt Poland would want that. \n\nAnd DPR and LPR are proxies for what?",
         "Well the war in Ukraine is viewed by Russia as existential. So yeah. Russia will not let itself be denied victory.",
         "How could it not. \nRussia launched a missile that was meant to hit a target in Ukraine. \nSome other country said nope. And launched AA missile from their territory and destroyed the missile in Ukranian air space. \n\nAnd you're saying Russia should just say. Ah well. Since the AA battery is not in Ukraine we wont touch it and will continue letting it shoot our missiles and planes?",
         "Unfortunately the school of thought that treats it as existential also extends into other NATO countries.  So if we consider it true that Russia considers it existential, then we must consider it only a first step before also moving into the Baltics and others, meaning NATO must also consider it existential.\n\nRelated to this, my \"shoeshine boy\" moment came very early on in the war, when Russia recognized things were going so well.  On that one Russian talk show, one of the guests was trying to rationalize why things were not really so bad, including \"...and there's been no intervention [by NATO]\".",
         "I\u2019m saying that Russia would do exactly that to save face and not escalate against NATO.\n\nWhen turkey shot down a Russian jet for violating its airspace, what was Russia\u2019s response?\n\nEdit: the fact that you even ask \u201chow could it not?\u201c shows to me how much you *don\u2019t* know about geopolitics, and that I would be better served talking to people who know shit. Have a good day.",
         "I seriously doubt Russia would directly engage current NATO members in any shape or form unless they directly engage first. \n\nThis means the Baltic states are pretty much safe and can continue their demographic demise unassisted.",
         "Its response was handled by diplomacy. And your example isnt valid. \n\nA Russian jet violated Turkish airspace. And Turkey had the right to attack the plane. \n\nHere we're talking about Poland shooting down missiles in Ukranian airspace. \n\nAnd if Russia doesn't escalate, what would stop NATO from shooting everything in Ukranian airspace? \nNATO could then make it so that no Russian missiles or jets fly in Ukraine, while at the same time enabling Ukranian fighter jets. And you're saying Russia would be fine with this?"

North Korea lacks the resource or industrial base of Russia, South Korea has a far more capable industrial base than Ukraine, and the technological gap between the Koreas\u2019 military equipment is laughable. As such, the North Korean military is actually not optimised for a long war of attrition like the Russo-Ukrainian War and is instead optimised for a quick, intense operation *intended* to capture Seoul and negotiate a fait accompli peace agreement from a position of strength while holding Seoul - it simply doesn\u2019t have the resources or logistics for a war of attrition. The goal of capturing Seoul is itself extremely optimistic given North Korea\u2019s hardware disadvantage.\n\nEven in a worst-case scenario where South Korea is alone and Russia is able to supply enough fuel and food to alleviate my point on North Korean resource shortages, North Korea is unlikely to meaningfully penetrate the DMZ, the South Korean air force *will* gain air superiority over North Korea in less of an air war and more of an air mass execution, and South Korea will destroy much of North Korea\u2019s government/military infrastructure and its Russian import corridor with cruise missiles and airstrikes. Use of nuclear weapons by North Korea could devastate South Korea if the nukes are launched before South Korea can destroy them, but would almost certainly invite US and/or *Chinese* military action against North Korea.\n\nA domestic nuclear deterrent would still be extremely useful for South Korea, but either North Korea\u2019s nuclear modernisation is either just to upgrade its peacetime nuclear deterrent or Kim Jong-un is living in a parallel reality.",

Essentially offering them nothing in the hope that North Korea would be desperate enough to take the deal. \n\nIf talks resume then North Korea now has a much stronger hand. The US will have learnt their lesson from last time and know they have to offer them a real deal. They also know that without acting quickly North Korea will rapidly increase their militarily and nuclear capabilities with Russian support. They will be a major problem for Ukraine in the short term, and risk the stability of East Asia in the long term. The strategy for the past few decades has been to sanction North Korea to limit their military growth and hopefully force regime collapse. Access to the Russian markets means this strategy has failed. \n\nThis is a win-win for the North. They either get their sanctions relief they desperately want in return for dropping their support of Russia, or they get a valuable long-term partner that can help them fix much more than just their military.

This is the \"assured\" part, because at that point it is the only move.  \n\nDirect attacks from Russia and China are the only two things that could possibly trigger MAD from the US's perspective.

Materiel in abundance acts as a force multiplier by allowing for numerous and comprehensive strikes to attrit larger enemy formations and allowing small units to hold out against an advance for longer. \n\nIt was always going to come down to the supply of equipment, this war has essentially been a test of NATO logistics against the Russian warmachine, because that is ultimately what collective defense relies upon, no one country quite having the manpower or materiel to fight off an aggressor but combined they exceed because of a collective stronger industrial base so long as the logistics chain is maintained.\n\nThe manpower shortage is definitely hurting Ukraine, which is why many in Europe have been pushing for a more direct intervention, but materiel supplies are crucial to reducing the disparity in manpower so they should not disregarded.",

I don't know if it has been made available to the USAF. As such, the F-15EX probably won't be using the AIM-174 for quite some time, if it gets access to it at all.\n\nThe supposed F-35/F-15EX combo probably won't be firing at air targets from hundreds of miles away, until the AIM-260 becomes operational.

Canada's only role in all of this was to pay for a highly useful complete SAM system as part of its support for Ukraine.  Canada also donated several hundred SAM missiles of which some were intended for the system but have since been used by Ukraine (which is fine).\n* There has been a litany of issues on the American side of the equation in scheduling production.  It has to do with the manufacturing model used for NASAMS (\"instance based\" ) and also some politics in America related to prioritizing American support, which put the CAD paid system to the back of the line.\n* and sadly in Canada the main opposition party used the delays, which were entirely outside the control of the CAD govt, for political football/govt bashing.  And their supporters ate it up.  The CAD govt could say little in return as it was bound under various confidentiality agreements.

The Defence Minister at the time, Anita Anand, then gave an interview in response to these questions in which she plainly stated that the system was already \u201cen route\u201d even though they had only gotten around to placing the order for it days earlier. \n\nOne can certainly understand *why* the government was so keen to disingenuously cast the impression it was on its way. They had received a lot of very positive PR when they made the announcement in the first place and a lot more again when Anand gave her interview. At the time they were deeply embroiled in a scandal relating to foreign election interference and new revelations were coming out almost every day which were highly damaging to the government\u2019s standing in the polls (and from which their polling has never recovered). Support for Ukraine being generally quite popular, was a great way to shift the narrative from an ongoing scandal to one a little more positive about them. \n\nThe opposition conservatives have *never* been critical of the purchase of this system for Ukraine. They *have* been critical over how long it took and how misleading the government has been in its statements surrounding it, and this criticism was entirely justified.\n\nIt is unfortunate that the government and its supporters continue to try to politicize assisting Ukraine \u2014 which all parties support \u2014 in order to win cheap political points.",

But the longest range missile the NASAMS can deploy: the  AMRAAM-ER is as least as, if not more expensive then an IRIS-T SLM/X and is shorter range and ceiling.\n\nIt will be interesting.  Diehl is apparently working on a variant of IRIS to shoot down hypervelocity missiles.  Kongsberg is apparently working on an anti-ballistic variant.\n\nWere it I and a good supply of missiles could be obtained I would order IRIS-T immediately.

So every like 30 or 40 years or however long the refresh cycle is for a lot of the boats is, they have to commit to investing in building up that capacity all over again.\n\nThis is the point of the National Shipbuilding Strategy, which has seen support from all major parties.  Under the previous shipbuilding plans, Canada built a dozen or so boats and then let the shipyards go idle for years, and the end result was that most of Canada's naval shipyards closed (we have three today, compared to 50-60 years ago there were 6+).  The point of the NSS is to just keep building something/anything and stop the wretched boom/bust cycle that's plagued the shipbuilding industry.  \n\nIt's expensive resurrecting a moribund industry, but the Liberals, Conservatives, Bloc, and NDP seem to think its worth it.\n\n> They've started to now purchase from the Koreans I believe.\n\nAFAIK there are no contracts with Korean shipyards to build anything for the Canadian navy right now.",

The list of procurement projects is significant and when done Canada will have a new navy, and almost an entirely new air force.

         "> the Laurier government fell in part as a result of a military ship procurement scandal. \n\nIt wasn't so much a military ship procurement scandal as it was the compromise Laurier made when his government *created the Navy* in 1910/11 that helped tank Laurier's hopes for re-election in 1911.  \n\nIn the early 1900's Canada had no navy, and Britain was in an arms race with Germany and wanted money from Canada to build dreadnoughts with which they said they'd defend Canada.  Borden's Conservatives were all-for Canada writing cheques to Britain because they were firm believers in the Empire and that if Britain said \"jump\" it was Canada's duty to ask \"how high?\" On the other side, French Canadian nationalists had zero interest in funding Britain's war machine and wanted a proper Canadian navy to defend Canada.  Laurier couldn't really afford to piss off English Canada and it's strong Anglo-imperialist vote, nor could he risk losing votes in his home province by ignoring French Canadian nationalists' demands either.\n\nLaurier's compromise was to establish a proper Canadian navy, but one that could fall under British command in times of war.  This compromise only served to piss off critics on both sides of the issue.  Borden and his Anglophile imperialists saw it as an insult to the Empire and questioned Laurier's loyalty to the crown, while nationalists on the other side claimed a Canadian navy that could be handed over to British command in war was worse than simply sending them money for dreadnoughts.\n\nIt should be said that this wasn't the only reason for Laurier's electoral defeat in 1911, and an arguably larger reason for his government's downfall was from his \"Canadian-American Reciprocity Treaty\" agreement he made with Taft's United States.  This was a revival of an earlier Reciprocity agreement from 1854-1866 and was sort of a proto-free trade agreement.  Borden's Conservatives made Reciprocity with the US out to be a grave insult to Britain and the Empire (\"how dare we insult Britain by strengthening trade with the Americans!\" kind of thing), and that it would turn control of Canada's economy over to the United States, and so his government ramped-up anti-American sentiment over this issue.  Between Reciprocity and the Naval Services Act, Borden made Laurier out to be something of a traitor to the Empire in English Canada, and the damage to his French Canadian base didn't help either.",

The difficulties are not insurmountable, but they require both political will and the support of the population.

         "For the very reasons you are giving, Ukraine cannot accept a peace deal that prevents security guarantees. Now, obviously, Russia and Ukraine have a lot of incompatible wargoals, but things like land, money, resources, and sanctions/relief can be exchanged, externally sourced or at least split down the middle, but the issue of security guarantees and NATO membership is a black and white issue that is fundamental to the conflict. If Ukraine gets out of this with guarantees, it has pretty much won, and if it doesn't, Russia has pretty much won., because as you say, they can come back later with more, and Ukraine would be fighting back with even less.\n\nIf Trump or anyone else tries to force a deal with no security guarantees, come hell or high water, Ukraine will fight to the death with anyone trying to impose this. Regardless of who is threatening them, no matter the odds, its an existential imperative, a matter of survival. In contrast, while the Russians obviously aren't giving up without a fight either, it's not an existential threat in the same way. They still have the rest of the Donbass, they still have Crimea, they still have Russia. Hypothetically, there is a point where a certain amount of leverage could move them back.\n\nThere is a possibility that Trump decides to play nuclear chicken against Putin and walk out with a W and that would include a peace deal with security guarantees for Ukraine. Ukraine, in contrast, has already been facing down a game of nuclear chicken since 2014 and hasn't given up yet. The US would face political backlash just for pulling the plug on Ukraine. I guarantee you, The fallout from actually turning against Kyiv is beyond what Mr. very big hands could handle. At the very least, it is a risk that Ukrainians would have a greater willingness to take, in the context of the game of chicken that would be the hypothetical peace negotiations.\n\nIn conclusion, a peace deal with security guarantees that could lead to NATO membership is possible, while a peace deal without security guarantees is no peace at all, and would *never* be accepted. But the most likely scenario is the war just drags on until one side or another has a big enough advantage.",

Every single move of support made is around \"how much do we have to hold back so the enemy doesn't launch nukes\", so it's being showcased that having nukes means a lot more security in the form of deterrence",
         "Nuclear nonproliferation is based on the idea of a rules based international order in which a nuclear power does not simply engage in threatening a thermonuclear exchange to get what it wants. Obviously that taboo has been broken. To be safe a nation needs to either have no enemies, have a nuclear deterrent, or shelter under the aegis of a nation with a nuclear deterrent. The primary nuclear aegis is the United States which has openly expressed a disinterest in continuing to underwrite the security of its allies.\n\nNuclear weapons aren\u2019t that hard to get for developed states with existing nuclear industries. Ukraine, Japan, South Korea etc. could all get them relatively easily. Iran only refuses to cross the finish line on theirs because they judge it to be more trouble than it\u2019s worth but they\u2019ve completed the tech. South Africa made them decades ago. \n\nWhen faced with an expansionist nuclear armed neighbour that demonstrates a willingness to engage in nuclear blackmail the requirement for a sovereign deterrent is clear. Americans will always say \u201cwhy should we die in a nuclear exchange rather than accept the loss of one inch of Latvian soil\u201d. When push comes to shove the American alliance is not credible, they can, have, and will be intimidated. To paraphrase cryptobros, not your nukes, not your deterrent.\n\nBut even if nuclear blackmail had not been extremely successful these last few years, there\u2019s still the problem of American isolationism. A large portion of the American political spectrum favour the unilateral dismantling of the American alliance network. Maybe not this year, maybe they\u2019ll never do it, but it\u2019s far too close to risk national survival on it. If it\u2019s a 50:50 that the US will still be in NATO when Russia invades then you need to develop your own nukes.\n\nNonproliferation no longer makes sense. It\u2019s a policy from a different time based on different assumptions.",
         "Any Ukrainian nuclear weapons would be far back and moved out before any Russians might get their hands on them.  Ukraine gave the Soviets back their nukes back in the day because they weren't worth much to Ukraine in any case because Ukraine didn't have the launch codes.  Ukraine could've salvaged the enriched uranium/plutonium but it would've had to make it into a new warhead.",

         "the 3:1 ratio(not rule) has nothing to do with casualties and was mostly used for medieval sieges as the ratio of attacker troops to defender troops(aka, the attacker should have 3x more men). The reason for that ratio is that the attacker takes more casualties initially when the phase of creating a breach is happening and/or scaling the walls, but afterwards, as long as they can bring in more men to the breach and exploit it(also a reason why they want 3x more men), the defenders can take more casualties than the attackers due to them being virtually wiped out, as its quite impossible to escape a siege alive, unless the commander of the army allows you to",
         "They are definitely using cruise/ballistic missiles in the East. Russia uses drones and cruise/ballistic missiles to target high value targets such as air defense and HIMARs providing support to the front lines. Every single HIMARS and Patriot loss in the past year or two has been to Russia spotting it out with an Orlan drone and then sending an Iskander at it. A good chunk of Ukrainian armor losses have been to lancets. SU 34s often use air launched cruise missiles on frontline positions, though recently UMPK glide bombs are more common because they're cheaper/more cost effective.",

The traditional ratios play a part in individual battles but not the overall conflict.",

Armenia vs azerbaijan? Bosnian war?\n\n\nIt's not applicable to modern wars. Now it's determined by technology and firepower.",

         "AH Israel yes. Even on fucking wikipedia page it is said that only 5% of actual combat positions are assigned to women lol",
         "OK, I'll bite.\n\n1. Even if we assume the statement \"the only way to get security is to have nukes\" is true (a statement which is problematic, to put it mildly), you can't derive \"nuclear nonproliferation is dead\". This is the so-called \"non-sequitur\" logical fallacy. Perhaps other countries can't get/make nukes even if they wanted to, in effect affirming the nuclear nonproliferation?\n\n2. Now, for the statement \"the only way to get security is having nukes\" itself: there are many countries I can think of that don't have nukes, yet they're pretty secure. Are New Zealand or Switzerland not really secure countries? On the other hand, Israel is known to have nukes, and yet that didn't seem to stop many neighboring countries from attacking it at some point in history. Or even Russia - although Russia is in possession of the largest nuclear arsenal in the World, that is seemingly not enough to secure the Kursk region from being invaded, or their refineries attacked.",
         "Because end of the day someone has to give the order and others have to obey it and I don't see how it makes any sense to give that order or obey it.  Meaning I can only conceive of that order being given in a suicidal tantrum and I can only conceive of anyone obeying such a suicidal order if they'd be as mindless zombies.  There are limits.",
         "They're still doing conscripted roles in the military, which is the point? The Ukrainian women should be conscripted to do roles according to their ability to support the war effort - for some that'd be combat, others support roles etc. It's disgustingly unfair that they're cheering on the war without being willing to make personal sacrifices."

Why do they get to go home every evening to their families instead of sitting and learning Torah while the soldier out in the field doesn't?

No disrespect to the women of the IDF meant personally, just explaining. but a good # of Israelis I\u2019ve spoken too are pretty traditional and actually strongly against expanding combat roles for women, the court actually had to force the military to start training female tank crews, they didn\u2019t want to.\u00a0",

They said the Middle East is never clean, and wouldn\u2019t be as quick as the government was claiming.  And yes, after 9/11 everyone was ready to sign up and bomb everything.

         "Iran is only about 3% of world-wide oil production.  To put that in context, the U.S. is over 20% and Saudi Arabia is about 12%.  Between the U.S. and SA alone, they could increase production to more than offset any drop off from Iran.  U.S. shale wells are profitable down to like $40 / barrel and only take about two weeks to drill.  \n\nThe problem isn't the % of oil that Iran produces but the % of oil that Iran can disrupt.  Iran's strategy is:  \"If I can't export oil through the Persian Gulf, no one can\" and they've tried to extend that to the Red Sea via the Houthis.  It's literally why Iran allies with the Houthis--it's a bottleneck on worldwide oil trade.\n\nThe problem with Iran executing on this strategy is they'll be destroyed.  Oil is an inelastic market and if they disrupt exports out of the Gulf and the Red Sea, the prices will spike astronomically and the world will be forced to respond with overwhelming violence to restore the global economy.  That's not an \"Israel Problem\" though, it's a Europe, Gulf State, and China problem.  It's barely a U.S. problem as the President can, by statute, nationalize our supply, and the U.S. produces far more than it consumes.\n\nMy point is, if Israel takes out Khark, Iran loses its economy and it's only options would result in its destruction.  Israel wins in every outcome.",

Does Israel's position get better or worse as a result of Iran starting a tanker war?\n\nI'm pretty sure the answer is that oil spikes for a month and Tehran ends up looking like the face of the moon courtesy of \"A Coalition of the Willing.\"  By the end, Iran won't even have operational wells and will be decades from returning to their former production--and that would require foreign assistance.

The people of Iran are not Israel's responsibility.  Israel does not have to suffer more attacks from Iran for the sake of Iranians.  Shutting down Iran's economy is the least violent way to prevent Iran from continuing to impose violence throughout the region.  As a side benefit, it will also restrict their ability to impose violence domestically.  A crippled central Iranian government will help reduce the stranglehold the Islamists have over that population.

They can absolutely handle the sweet crude from US production, but it is actually some of the highest grade oil in the world so it makes more sense to export it, since we can make fuel and plastic from imported heavy crude much cheaper.  \n  \nAlso, most imported US oil comes from Canada these days - very little actually comes from the gulf states.",
