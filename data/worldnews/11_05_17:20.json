It\u2019s only the hardliners that are against it, Khameneni probably forgets how much Iran and Israel worked together in the 80s",

         "Stay safe?\n\nStatistically, youre more likely to get murdered by an American police officer, better yet an American hoodlum, or even better yet an American school shooter than by the Irani regime, so, statistically speaking you'd generally live a safer life in Iran than in the U.S or U.K. \n\nI'm sorry to say this, Propaganda has structured and fortified your bias. It's as if reality holds no grounds anymore. Go visit Iran (as many YouTubers have) and then make YOUR OWN decision about their culture, lifestyle and/or how oppresive it is. \n\nIn regards to women and being safe. The more Islamic a country's government is and the more they prescribe the \"headscarf\" (the thing Mother Mary wore), the less rape and sexual assault occurs in the country, because, the sole reasons of the headscarf  is that it is mandated by God and that it is to protect a women's chastity \u2014 we know how women get treated when they show their bodies off and objectify themselves. \n\nA woman is more likely to get assaulted in England, France, Namibia, The U.S, Sweeden or Botswana than she is in Iran, Saudi Arabia, or Afghanistan (the only countries that have MANDATED the headscarf). Out of the top 50 countries with the highest rates of rape only 4 are \"headscarf wearing ones\" (Pakistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Turkey). In other words, a woman is safer in a headscarf wearing country than in a non headscarf wearing one.\n\nThe reason a woman might feel \"oppressed\" is because she wants to show her self off, or doesn't believe in what God has mandated, it's simple. Now, should women be allowed to dress in booty shorts if she desired, or be legally forced to cover herself up in public is the debate to have. Using the \"safety\" argument is a misnomer.\n\nDon't be biased, be fair.",

         "Just a reminder of how much Bush fucked up by including Iran in his [Axis of Evil comment](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/01/29/bush-axis-of-evil-2002-1127725).\n\nQuoting the \"Iran\" section of the [Reactions to 9/11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactions_to_the_September_11_attacks#Muslim_world_and_Middle_East). This was the chance to rebuild trust between the two nations. The fallout of Bush winning the 2000 are still with us\n\n> Iranian president Mohammad Khatami and Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei condemned and denounced the attacks and the terrorists who carried them out. Iranians who gathered for a soccer match in Tehran two days after the 9/11 attacks observed a moment of silence. There was also a candlelight vigil. Huge crowds attended candlelit vigils in Iran, and 60,000 spectators observed a minute's silence at Tehran's soccer stadium. On Tuesday, September 25, in 2001, Khatami meeting British Foreign Secretary, Jack Straw, said: \"Iran fully understands the feelings of the Americans about the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington on September 11.\" He said although the American administrations had been at best indifferent about terrorist operations in Iran (since 1979), the Iranians instead felt differently and had expressed their sympathetic feelings with bereaved Americans in the tragic incidents in the two cities.\" He also stated that \"Nations should not be punished in place of terrorists.\" According to Radio Farda's website, in 2011, on the anniversary of the attacks, United States Department of State, published a post at its blog, in which the Department thanked Iranian people for their sympathy and stated that they would never forget Iranian people's kindness on those harsh days. This piece of news at Radio Farda's website also states that after the attacks' news was released, some Iranian citizens gathered in front of the Embassy of Switzerland in Tehran, which serves as the protecting power of the United States in Iran, to express their sympathy and some of them lit candles as a symbol of mourning.",

Leadership is still claiming God walks with them as they build prisons for families and children to rot in and they document prisoners with numbers written on their heads instead of their names. \n\nI wonder which fire will smolder for another 50 years and which will burn itself out in the next 20 \ud83e\udd14",

Something of the past.\n\nAlso, what you're saying is stupid anyway.\n\nIn the Koran Allah literally gives Israel to the jews. But he also claim it back, just after.\n\n> O my people! Enter the Holy Land which Allah has destined for you \u02f9to enter\u02fa. And do not turn back or else you will become losers.\u201d\n\n5.2\n\n>  Allah made a covenant with the Children of Israel and appointed twelve leaders from among them and \u02f9then\u02fa said, \u201cI am truly with you.

         "So 2.94% penalty on the total sales. \n\nThat\u2019ll show \u2018em. \n/s",
         "To all the folks crying treason, GF\u2019s explanation for this actually makes sense - companies use trade compliance software that validates that customers are not on restricted trading lists, and in this instance the material was purchased by a legitimate customer who requested the material be sent to a 3rd Party OSAT. This OSAT is the sanctioned party in this case. When the GF salesperson (or account exec, etc) attempted to validate that the OSAT was valid, the trade compliance software approved the transfer so it went through. It wasn\u2019t until a later audit where they found that the information for this particular OSAT was misentered into the system so when it should\u2019ve been blocked, it wasn\u2019t. At that point is when GF notified the regulators and agreed to pay the fine. \n\nThey don\u2019t say what the product was that was shipped, but GF isn\u2019t competing with the TSMCs of the world at the cutting edge nodes, so I think it\u2019s pretty unlikely that anything of extraordinary value was provided to the Chinese government. Their internal fabs are already more than capable of matching GFs level of technology",
         "Before commenting on the size of the fine, reading the article would reveal that the fine was reduced due to cooperation. GlobalFoundries volunteered the information leading to this case. Moreover, sharing order details such as  contacts and transfers is much more valuable than punishing a company that willingly divulges necessary info.",

I don't know from reading whether that data source was owned by the trade compliance software vendor, or GF.

Part of the outcome of this is software vendors and companies are going to require validated data entry lists.",

That is an unfortunate aspect of reality.\n\nIf it was general policy to have a corporate death penalty for certain actions undertaken by corporations then employees would steer clear of suspect companies and would be more diligent in detecting and reporting these kinds of things before they escalate to the corporate death penalty.",

         "Absolutely 100% asshole!",
         "As I said earlier, you add the profit or revenue gained from illegal activity on top of the fine. You also can add criminal charges that can limit what actions the business can do, like they can't bid on government contracts for X amount of years, etc. You can also add criminal charges to the leadership that knew and condoned the illegal activity.\n\nThere is a lot you can do besides a corporate death penalty.\n\n>employees would steer clear of suspect companies and would be more diligent in detecting and reporting these kinds of things before they escalate to the corporate death penalty\n\nSure on paper that could happen, but in reality, it isn't likely to happen that much, in large to medium businesses, not everyone will be in the know of what is going on. For example, you could have a corporation that has been clean since the start, and then one department, does cross the line. You expect every new hire and every department to know about the illegal activity? No, it would be almost impossible for new hires to know and for other departments, the probability would be very low.\n\nOn top of that, employees might fear that if they report something, it might end up with the corporate death penalty, which means if they report it, it could end up in them losing their jobs. We already have to have laws on the books for whistleblowing already, where if the whistleblower receives reprisals, they can sue the company for those reprisals. And that doesn't always help out.\n\nThe only time that a corporate death penalty would be acceptable is if their whole business is built on illegal activity. Meaning they can not continue to function without the illegal activity. But we already have that essentially on the books already.",
         "They would still be out of a job.",
         "If their job is to commit crimes, that's just too damned bad. They can work for an employer that isn't making them commit crimes.",
         "As I mentioned in an earlier comment, I mentioned if the employees weren't involved in criminal behavior. It really feels like everyone commenting either is not reading what I'm saying or just doesn't care.",
         "Doesn't matter. If their company is doing criminal activities then their job is part of criminal activity. Thus no more job. Not the employees fault but life isn't fair either"

         "\nIrans goal around Nuclear weapons is one of strategic ambiguity about whether they will actually get them. Their ideal strategic position to be in, is one where the world knows they could ramp up and get a nuke with a month or twos work, but not actually do that work and change the entire regions strategic balance and the chess board.\n\nIran is very aware that if it actually acquires nuclear weapons? If it actually becomes a nuclear power? It changes the entire game in the region, with Saudi Arabia and Turkey both acquiring nuclear weapons very quickly, Israel and the US getting very close to launching full scale campaigns against Iran to try put the genie back in the bottle, and Irans \u201caxis of evil\u201d friends China and Russia walking away from them (because none of the nuclear powers want new nuclear powers to appear. None.)\n\nBut Iran also wants the threat of it **could** get nukes to always be there, because it allows it to use that threat as a deescalation strategy whenever things start to heat up. And it keeps Iran relatively safe from direct interventions (their little exchanges with Israel recently not withstanding). It also lets Iran have the occasional \u201cnuclear deal\u201d or treaties with global powers where it can use the promise of not finishing its nuclear program to get a concessions it wants.\n\nWe know from Western, Russian and Chinese sources (which all largely agree), that Iran is technically at a point now where it is weeks away from having a nuclear device. It has been in this position for most of 2024. They could have half a dozen nuclear weapons by Christmas very easily if they chose to. They are choosing **not to**, because actually getting the weapon would be terrible for them, but the ability to get it is fantastic for them.",

They have to make a lot of unconventional choices for their control surfaces as a result, which makes flying the plane without some kind of computer assisted control really difficult, basically impossible really. Plus, it gives a significant advantage to our pilots by allowing them to focus on other tasks by freeing up some of the attention needed to maneuver the plane. \n\nThe reality is that Russia is way way behind us in terms of knowledge on how to build planes with minimal RCS. They try to compromise for this a bit by building a larger aircraft that can accommodate more powerful radars so the Su-57 can, in theory at least, detect a threat long before it gets close enough to target the Su-57. However, against a proper stealth fighter like an F-22 or F-35, those aircraft would still probably get target lock and take down an Su-57 before they even knew what hit them, because it\u2019s basically invisible on radar, especially next to a monster like the Su-57 that sticks out on radar like a sore thumb.

The MiG 1.44/1.42 program MFI (multifunctional frontline fighter *English translation*)was the proceeding Soviet and then now Russian answer to the US atf program.",
         "Based on quick Wikipedia reads both planes were initiated in the 80s as the 'replacement plane' to the current top of the line but the programme that became the SU-57 was delayed by 9 years from 91-2000 because of a, thing, and it's been plagued by funding issues/corruption/brain drain ever since\n\nWe do need to be cautious about calling it a pile of dog crap though, this is a clear tech transfer to China and the Chinese maybe able to take an idea or two to improve on the J35 or figure out if they can mass produce the su-57 with improvements for localized air dominance in Europe. The cumulative sum of the current SU-57 makes it a laggard in the 5th gen space but they aren't on serialized production really and if incremental improvements can be made with this tech transfer it can move the needle on what their adversaries need to consider when countering it or the J series fighters",
         "The Mig-25 was hyped by Western intelligence, not by the Soviets.",
         "Look man, when a guy who worked in air defence says the 57's cross section is abysmal, I believe it. I also believe when he says the us has to put radar reflectors on their 22's and 35's to make them visible for peacetime operations.\n\nRussia has a history of massively overpromising what their planes can do and woefully underdelivering. I doubt the plane would even compete against the jets that are supposed to be its peers.",
         "Very fair, I won't dispute the wisdom in your ways.",
         ">the AIM-174 is still a prototype. [...] to my knowledge, no F/A-18 Super Hornets has ever fired one\n\nThis is highly misleading.\n\nThe Navy has already [acknowledged](https://www.navalnews.com/naval-news/2024/07/u-s-navy-confirms-sm-6-air-launched-configuration-is-operationally-deployed/) the AIM-174b is operationally deployed at present.\n\nObviously the notion of F-15EXs carrying the AIM-174b is purely speculative. This should be self-evident enough that you shouldn't feel the need to paint the missile as some pie-in-the-sky prototype of unproven worth.",
         "Not that I know of. Seems like a Typhoon/Gripen/Rafale thing mostly.",
         "We already know f-35s can guide sm-6s fired from ships, so change out f15ex for super hornets as the missile truck and you have publicly shown technology that you want.   \n\nNow if you want to talk about what we have been shown. Can the Russians field enough su-57s for this to even matter?",
         "China: quick we'll just change one letter that way **nobody** will know we stole the tech!",
         "Never happened.",
         "Yes, yes. Chinese are racially inferior and can't design anything complicated. Just like the Japanese. Oh wait, it is not 1938 anymore.",
         "Aw beans! Thank ya!",
         "It's pretty rad that Russia's new hotness can't hold up to our stuff from the 80's and 90's.\n\nThe Felon just came out and can't compete and the Raptor that first deployed about two decades ago...or likely even the 70's vintage F-15.\n\nAnd the NGAD and FA-XX are in the works.",
         "As a American, it\u2019s still my favorite plane from a foe, and probably the best plane the Russians produced. It was purely designed to take down the SR-71, and though it would have likely failed in its mission if it was finished in time, it\u2019s still a fascinating piece of Soviet Cold War technology.",
         "Not to mention, while the SR-71 only ever had a handful of airframes and was operated by one country, the AIM-120D is being used by multiple countries and there are thousands (?) of them. With so many operators and wide usage, if it has much more range than publicly stated, I expect to see it leaked in the Warthunder forums by now.",
         ">This is nonstandard, highly misleading use of the word 'prototype.'\n\nThe only photos of Super Hornets carrying that missile are inert stand-ins, hence why I said \"prototype\".\n\nThe main point is that the F-15EX probably isn't able to carry and fire the missile.",
         "Correct. So this capability probably doesn't exist right now.",
         "Well, that's pretty different from the initial claim of F-35 guiding missiles from F-15EX at targets hundreds of miles away, isn't it?\n\n>Can the Russians field enough su-57s for this to even matter?\n\nProbably not, but that's not what we're discussing.",
         "Lol",
         "Like their Jeeep!",
         "To be fair, I don\u2019t think the Chinese don\u2019t call it the J-35.",
         "American companies aren\u2019t immune to not understanding the design and manufacturing processes of other countries. \n\nLook at the Toyota system. Lots of American companies wholesale copied it, and it ended up with cascading production issues when supply chains were disrupted. Toyota understood their systems and knew where they were weak, and built stockpiles in critical goods.\n\nWhen you just copy something without understanding how and why it was designed you\u2019re going to have adverse effects.",
         "Said nothing about them racially.  There are cultural issues at play though and political issues that are keeping their products inferior.",
         "I definitely understand that, but the US has a habit of saving the best for ourselves. I would be highly surprised if we didn't have air to air capability touching on 200+ miles, we definitely do for certain platforms and applications (JASM-ER for example).\n\nPlus we already know the infosec issues with war thunder forums, and while most of the breaches on there were for classified info, they weren't really all too consequential of breaches IIRC. \n\nWe're talking air-to-air missiles, something I'm sure are a highly guarded secret, where only a select group of people know the true range (maybe not even the pilots themselves). It's simple to code in switches in tech to make sure the full features are walled off until someone gives the go-ahead. \n\nHowever, you're absolutely right on your original point. Focusing on publicly available knowledge is best, since it's all just idle speculation. I'll defer to you on this.",
         ">The only photos of Super Hornets carrying that missile are inert stand-ins, hence why I said \"prototype\".\n\nYep - but, again, I think there are relevant facts *beyond* the two you presented, which are useful as everyone draws their own conjectures / conclusions:\n\nYes: (1) the photos of the AIM-174b have only shown us inert stand-ins, and (2) the missile has not been publicly acknowledged to have been fired from an F/A-18.\n\nBut also: (3) the U.S. Navy has confirmed that it is operationally deployed in its air-launched configuration, and (4) the missile itself has already been used [*in combat*](https://www.twz.com/sea/navys-sm-6-missile-used-in-combat-report) in its booster-motivated configuration.\n\nIn fact, I'd caveat (1): the \"CATM\" designation [we last saw](https://theaviationist.com/2024/09/11/f-a-18f-heavy-air-to-air-load-aim-174s/) taxonomically distinguishes it from Y-prefixed prototypes and X-prefixed experimental deployments. The C prefix means it's the captive (training dummy) version of a production missile.\n\n>The main point is that the F-15EX probably isn't able to carry and fire the missile.\n\nAgreed, although we must admit this is speculative. There would certainly be a lot of software work to integrate the SM-6 into the F-15's datalink / guidance systems, which are obviously different from the Navy's Super Hornets, but (to my admittedly thin knowledge on all this) I don't know that there's an outright incompatibility that would make this impossible.",
         "Didn't claim it did. Just that our Eurocanard flying friends have enviable range with their neat-o cool guy throttling missiles. \n\nAlso, don't forget the AIM-260. According to Wikipedia, it's on schedule and expecting a \"some time in 2024\" production with a published range of 120 miles. It's F-35 compatible. \n\nWe also have the AIM-174B, fired from Super Hornets, with a published range of \"*at least* 130 miles.\"\n\nI'd say between these, we're doing just great against the Su-57.",
         "What jet gives the aim 174b a ride is irrelevant.  It's the capabilities of the missile and the f35 that make this possible. You're hung up on the least important detail",
         "Nah, they call it,  \u201cwe straight up stole the f35 designs\u201d35",
         "I am just saying that this talk about \"Chinese can only copy\" is similar to the pre-WW2 sentiment in USA and UK. This has caused many pilots to enter combat with superiority complex, fully confident in their own skills and machines. This has cost them their lives. Yes, maybe J20 is not great. But it is also possible that industrial espionage combined with domestic research allowed Chinese to build true state of the art fighter. Be prepared. Stay vigilant.",
         "I've addressed the AIM-174 and AIM-260 in another reply. The gist of it, is that the former is currently used by the US Navy, and the latter almost certainly isn't meeting the 2024 production claim.\n\nAs such, the capability of F-35 guiding missiles from F-15EX at targets hundreds of miles away, probably currently doesn't exist. It might become true in the next few years, but not as of right now.",
         "No I'm not, because the claim isn't \"F-35 can guide missiles\"; the claim is \"F-35 guiding missiles fired by F-15EX at targets hundreds of miles away\". I'm saying that it can't do that, because there isn't a missile available to the F-15EX with enough range to make it happen. And AFAIK, that is true."

Or Poland could hit a few missiles, then Russia destroys a couple patriot batteries and Poland calls it a day and we don't spiral anywhere. But if that the case, why even bother shooting a few missiles in the first place?\n\nWhy are they so afraid? Because Russia, like a handful of other countries on planet Earth, has the capability to destroy anyone and everything with a push of a button. And yes, the same courtesy extends to North Korea, China and the like. \n\n  \nNuclear weapons are a deterrent of aggression. Because if you attack anyone that has nuclear weapons you risk millions of lives. And not somewhere far far away, but on your own home soil.

The only reason why the UK is commonly named is because Brits believe that they are an important player in this conflict, when they are little more than a minor bystander. Secondly, correct, the US and Germany generally provide weapons to Israel that Ukraine would not use anyway. \n\nFor example, the US mostly provides gravity bombs and interceptors for Israeli missile defenses. Neither of these are likely to be used by Ukraine. They have no use for bombs that would require their jets to fly over the front, because they'd be shot down, or missile interceptors for systems they don't have in the first place. And the most important arms Germany provides is ships and submarines - what are Ukraine going to do with those?",

How much more advanced the world is and their idea of demonizing the west shifts to a more realistic perspective. Who knows. Will definitely be interesting and devastatingly tragic as the losses will inevitably only lead to more loss.",

         "Interesting timing, with the American elections on. I doubt it's having an effect but it was worth a try. And it also meant the current American government would have a more mute response, for now.",
         "Not a good Korea choice for them.",
         "There's an estimated what? 11-12k Norks spread across the Russian lines...\n\nRussia and Ukraine can easily burn through 12k soldiers in a week if their operations are particularly taxing that given week.

         "They're getting food.",

This was a chance to get away with something and test the red lines a little more. \n\nThe rest of the EU should be ashamed of itself for not stepping up more though. It's literally their back yard.",
         "Depends on how the election goes today",
         "Really? Because from what I can tell, NATO is bleeding Russia dry, forcing it to bring in poorly trained foreign troops, buy second rate military hardware, and steadily boil off its financial reserves, not to mention demonstrating the inability of Russia to project force more than a few hundred kilometers from its own border.\n\nAll without a single NATO battlefield casualty.",
         "That\u2019s probably true. North Koreans have suffered a lot under that regime and sending troops probably isn\u2019t going to make a difference. \n\nYou never know though. Disgruntled troops could do something. If enough of them are like \u201cscrew fighting in Ukraine\u201d it could spread. Things like that happen fast.

         "Russia brought the foreign troops to save face with the population around Moscow. The less conscripts from within the better for Russia at this point. \nUnfortunately like others have stated. UKRAINE is having trouble with recruitment. They\u2019ve been fighting for 10 years. While that helped Ukraine become the lethal fighting force we see today, they simply can\u2019t outlast Russia on their own.",
         "What makes you think the North Korean troops are not good? Probably not the best but a country who spends what I assume is 80%+ of their resources on military / military capabilities has to be above recruiting African armies, which is what I would call second rate",
         "You can damn well bet that whomever the North Koreans send abroad are carefully vetted for loyalty and their families and relatives are taken hostage to ensure their compliance.\n\nIt's the same stuff they do with their 'migrant worker' program; North Korea sends people abroad to a number of countries to work in labour camps and factories overseas to earn cash for the North Korean state. The North Koreans have tens of thousands of people working overseas under this program, so doing stuff like this isn't new for them.",
         "Bo body!",

         "Every army without real combat experience is, almost definitionally, second rate. It's the one thing you can't just throw resources at.",
         "By the leaked accounts of Russian soldiers who think the NK troops are pretty useless. As the other responder notes, these soldiers simply are not battle tested. Doubtless they're very good at marching up and down the square beside plywood missiles, but in the face of an opposing army that's already had over two and a half years of battlefield experience, these guys are literally just targets.\n\nIf there are enough of them and they actually survive, then yes, in time some will become seasoned soldiers, but I doubt NK is going to give Russia that many troops that it's going to make that much difference.",

         "That ends tonight at 8pm",
         "Blowing up some Ivans and Kimchis to protect Europe is only going to be unpopular with the all ready aligned enemies of the state",

         "Yes, most countries are like that. The USA had very specific policies pre WWII, and then VERY different priorities post WWII, and to be frank, perhaps isolationism post WWII would have kept the CIA in check. \n\nMaybe, maybe not. I am not a historian nor political scientist."

         "Key russian points on \"peace\" talks on \u00a0March 7, 2022:\n\n* Ukraine was offered \u201cnot to develop, produce, purchase, or deploy on its territory missile weapons of any type with a range of more than 250 km.\u201d\u00a0**The Kremlin would also reserve the right to ban \u201cany other types of weapons\u201d in the future.**\n* **Ukraine should reduce its army to 50,000 people,**\u00a0including 1,500 officers (five times less than Ukraine had by 2022).\n* **Recognition of the independence of the so-called Donetsk and Luhansk \u201crepublics\u201d**\u00a0within the administrative regions of Ukraine.\n* The\u00a0**lifting of all sanctions**, both Ukrainian and international, and the pullback of all international lawsuits filed since 2014.\n* All guarantor states agree to activate the assistance mechanism. (This would have given Moscow veto power to override the defense mechanism. In addition, Moscow rejected a Ukrainian demand that guarantor states could establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine in the event of an attack.)\n* **Ukraine that should bear the costs of rebuilding the Donbas infrastructure**\u00a0destroyed since 2014.\n* re-legalize Soviet and communist symbols in Ukraine.\n\nLater, Ukraine declined further negotiations with Russia, particularly due to evidence of atrocities committed by the Russian army in Bucha.",
         "By \"early\" they're referring to February of 2022, when the Russians still thought they were gonna take Kiev. The Bucha massacrewas on-going at this stage of the negotiations. the terms are exactly what Putin said he wanted early in the War: Ukraine with an army too small to defend itself, permenently neutral so no access to Western weapons, large territories ceded to mother Russia, etc.\n\nSo bullshit demands issued while they were committing genocide.",
         "Sometimes I remember how they fought this to make Ukraine neutral and ended up flipping Finland and Sweden into NATO and have a sensible chuckle.",
         "So basically, Russia gets everything they wanted and Ukraine gets nothing in return. \n\n  \nTop tier copium.",
         "The only way I can imagine Ukraine would accept being neutral is if Russia agrees to cede all territory seized since 2014 to prove that they don't have radical imperialist tendencies at the core of their foreign policy.\n\n  \nI don't believe that for a second though.",
         ">*It reportedly called for Ukraine to shrink its army fivefold to fewer than 50,000 personnel and formally recognize Ukraine\u2019s Donetsk and Luhansk regions and Crimea as Russian lands*\u00a0\n\nJust one week earlier, putin declared to the World that they were not interested in land grabbing, just to denazify and demilitarized Ukraine.",
         "I demand putins shriveled old balls in a small case. To be carried by the president of ukraine from now on.",
         "When I first read them, I was pretty surprised...surprisingly. Like, 50k troops max? 35k land troops? That's less than Belarus. Those terms were worse than Versailles and Compiegne, dawg.",
         "Pro-Russia propagandists keep insisting that Ukraine rejected the \u201cpeace deal\u201d because the West told them to.\n\nI can tell you that this \u201cpeace deal\u201d isn\u2019t a peace deal - it\u2019s Russia bullying weaker Ukraine to accept their demands. Russia wanted to gain lands without a fight - that\u2019s why they launched a strike against Kyiv hoping that Zelenskyy will capitulate. But they underestimated Zelenskyy\u2019s resolve.\n\nWith such \u201cpeace deal\u201d it\u2019s obvious that Russia will invade again. Russia likely will make Ukraine to be one of its satellite states. Russia may then install some of its troops inside Ukraine to \u201cprotect Russian-speaking population\u201d just like what they did in Transnistria. With only 1/5 of her military it would be very hard for Ukraine to resist the second invasion.\n\nI would even say that even if Ukraine loses in the end, they have fought hard and bloodied Russia so many times. Russia now will realize that invading someone will send 100,000+ of their own people to their end, hopefully dissuading them and China for making such foolish endeavors. We didn\u2019t even go to the \u201cguerrilla\u201d phase yet when conventional army like Russia will suffer more losses - just like what SU and the USA faced in Afghanistan.",
         "Ukraine will never agree to this, because they literally already had a treaty in place with Russia that said Russia would respect Ukraines borders in return for Ukraine giving Russia their nukes.\n\nDo they really think Ukraine would fall for it a second time? Will Putin write \"but this time it is for realsies\" in the treaty?\n\nThe only way Ukraine can survive is if it is allowed to protect itself.",
         "Russia is known to not keep its share of promises, is known to destabilize democracies in the west and is known to slyly making other foreign nationals fight in army. In short, they are nothing less than a terrorist state.\n\nMoreover, their list of human rights violations is too long to ignore and thus, they should not be negotiated with at all.",
         "Interesting that this is the \"great peace deal\" all the pro-Putins (including the useful idiots (including the whole \"peace now! at all costs!\" that is basically saying Ukraine should surrender and capitulate) as well as the on-the-nose rightwingers and MAGA in the west and beyond) have been bringing out as this gotcha! moment. It's only slightly less ridiculous than the later \"peace deal\" Putin offered. How predictable of that whole sphere of society.",
         "Reminder that Russia is the sole cause of Ukraine no longer being neutral.",
         "I would have responded to this ridiculous demand by Russia with one word, \"NUTS!\"",

         "It is long past the time for Russia to negotiate. They f***** around, and it's time for them to find out.",
         "Pro-Russians like to make the talking point that Ukraine and the West rejected Russia's \"fair\" peace deal, but honestly after this masterful display of diplomacy I wouldn't blame Ukraine to tell Russia to go fuck themselves on any other subsequent \"peace attempts\".",
         "Counter offer:\n\nRussia will pay Ukraine war reparations as 10% of its GDP every year for 15 years.\n\nRussia will pay 25% of its GDP as a lump sump to Ukraine immediately.\n\nRussia will return Crimea to Ukraine.\n\nRussia will dismantle her Black Sea fleet.\n\nRussia will cede all her Black Sea coastal areas to Ukraine.\n\nRussia will release Siberian Far East as an independent nation with its security guaranteed by American and China.\n\nRussia will return Vladivostok to China.\n\nRussia will dismantle its nuclear arsenal. \n\nRussia will reduce its military to 5 cops and a dog.\n\nVladimir Putin will jump out of the nearest 10-story window.\n\nThere, totally reasonable peace deal :)",

         "Russia demands should be stored next to the unicorn saddles",

         "Let's not forget that Russia published an [ultimatum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/December_2021_Russian_ultimatum_to_NATO) to NATO in December 2021. Ukraine is just a stepping stone and any \"peace\" will be just a stopgap to Russia's ultimate goals shared in the ultimatum.",
         "I mean, they should just agree and then renege. Like Russia did with Ukraine getting rid of nukes.",
         "Would be funny to start seeing Ukraine make these silly demands to Russia and see how the Russians react",
         "Russia and those that support them are clowns.  After the incendiary devices found yesterday, all range restrictions should be lifted and Ukraine\u2019s leadership should get a walk through of any non classified, non critical storage arsenal to pick what they feel they need to kick Russia back to 1500.  The difference between Russia and a terrorist state is the nukes, and unless we\u2019ve truly grown so spineless as to let them do what they want because they\u2019re willing to rattle their sabers, something will have to be done.",

         "There was also a clause (also buried in an annex) that did allow for other states to defend this neutralized Ukraine on their own (since its own army would be gutted), which was just as laughable, because it meant that the next time Putin invented some excuse to invade, it WOULD only require 2-3 days to completely take over this de-militarized Ukraine, so that any guarantor states (even if any could be found who would be insane enough to sign on to this joke of an agreement) would at that point have to fight to undo a fait accompli, again, all without Ukraine's help. \n\nAnd the Putin trolls have ever since been angrily muttering about why Boris Johnson would say no to such a swell deal.\n\n>According to multiple former senior US officials we spoke with, in April 2022, Russian and Ukrainian negotiators appeared to have tentatively agreed on the outlines of a negotiated interim settlement: Russia would withdraw to its position on February 23, when it controlled part of the Donbas region and all of Crimea, and in exchange Ukraine would promise not to seek NATO membership, and instead [Ukraine would receive security guarantees from a number of countries\u2026](https://twitter.com/BMarchetich/status/1564663207087804422)\n\nAnd we're all seeing what security guarantees like these (i.e., much like those given in the Budapest Memorandum) amount to right about now.\n\nAs for the rest, here's a [tweet](https://x.com/dszeligowski/status/1743975556289269913) that explains it pretty well, and mentions how the discovery of the Bucha atrocities helped shut down the negotiations.",
         "damn they might aswell include a term that says that ukraine will be passing their sovereignty to russia",
         "And once Ukraine will do it all that, it will be much easier target for another invasion. Great deal. What about Russia giving up nuclear weapons and combat aviation?",

         "PYONGYANG \u2014 In a historic but baffling display of power, North Korea has once again declared its hostility toward the Pacific Ocean, reportedly launching yet another missile barrage against what it calls \"the great blue menace.\" Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un has branded the sea an \"existential threat,\" claiming it was \u201chigh time we sent a message to the oceans who threaten our sovereignty.\u201d\n\nThis follows a series of missile launches that have repeatedly landed in the open water, all aimed at what state media describes as \"critical ocean targets.\" The targets, sources confirm, are mostly arbitrary patches of sea where fish and plankton may or may not reside.\n\nDuring a recent speech to a select group of state-approved journalists, Kim Jong-un emphasized that \u201cthe Pacific is an unforgiving enemy that has long been underestimated.\u201d He cited tidal waves, humidity, and saltwater corrosion as evidence of the ocean\u2019s relentless aggression toward North Korea.\n\n\u201cLet this be a message to all waters, rivers, seas, and oceans who seek to undermine the dignity of our nation. Our missiles will find you, no matter where you are!\u201d he proclaimed.\n\nMilitary officials in North Korea claim the ongoing attacks have successfully \u201cintimidated the sea into submission,\u201d though reports suggest that the sea appears unmoved. Satellite images show it continues to behave as it always has, indifferent to the nation\u2019s aggression, lapping peacefully against its shores.\n\nInternational analysts are, understandably, puzzled. \u201cIt\u2019s almost as if North Korea thinks the ocean has done something personal to them,\u201d said a bewildered expert from the UN. \u201cWhile most nations use missile tests to demonstrate technological progress or power, North Korea seems genuinely to believe it\u2019s in some kind of grudge match with the ocean itself.\u201d\n\nNorth Korean citizens, meanwhile, have been encouraged to \u201cshow their loyalty to the anti-sea campaign\u201d by boycotting seafood, avoiding swimming, and wearing state-issued armbands with slogans like Down with the Tide! and The Ocean Must Pay!\n\nIn a final show of defiance, the North Korean regime has promised to continue its anti-ocean campaign indefinitely, or until \u201cthe sea learns its lesson.\u201d As of now, the ocean could not be reached for comment.",

The Defence Minister at the time, Anita Anand, then gave an interview in response to these questions in which she plainly stated that the system was already \u201cen route\u201d even though they had only gotten around to placing the order for it days earlier. \n\nOne can certainly understand *why* the government was so keen to disingenuously cast the impression it was on its way. They had received a lot of very positive PR when they made the announcement in the first place and a lot more again when Anand gave her interview. At the time they were deeply embroiled in a scandal relating to foreign election interference and new revelations were coming out almost every day which were highly damaging to the government\u2019s standing in the polls (and from which their polling has never recovered). Support for Ukraine being generally quite popular, was a great way to shift the narrative from an ongoing scandal to one a little more positive about them. \n\nThe opposition conservatives have *never* been critical of the purchase of this system for Ukraine. They *have* been critical over how long it took and how misleading the government has been in its statements surrounding it, and this criticism was entirely justified.\n\nIt is unfortunate that the government and its supporters continue to try to politicize assisting Ukraine \u2014 which all parties support \u2014 in order to win cheap political points.",

But the longest range missile the NASAMS can deploy: the  AMRAAM-ER is as least as, if not more expensive then an IRIS-T SLM/X and is shorter range and ceiling.\n\nIt will be interesting.  Diehl is apparently working on a variant of IRIS to shoot down hypervelocity missiles.  Kongsberg is apparently working on an anti-ballistic variant.\n\nWere it I and a good supply of missiles could be obtained I would order IRIS-T immediately.

Borden's Conservatives were all-for Canada writing cheques to Britain because they were firm believers in the Empire and that if Britain said \"jump\" it was Canada's duty to ask \"how high?\" On the other side, French Canadian nationalists had zero interest in funding Britain's war machine and wanted a proper Canadian navy to defend Canada.  Laurier couldn't really afford to piss off English Canada and it's strong Anglo-imperialist vote, nor could he risk losing votes in his home province by ignoring French Canadian nationalists' demands either.\n\nLaurier's compromise was to establish a proper Canadian navy, but one that could fall under British command in times of war.  This compromise only served to piss off critics on both sides of the issue.  Borden and his Anglophile imperialists saw it as an insult to the Empire and questioned Laurier's loyalty to the crown, while nationalists on the other side claimed a Canadian navy that could be handed over to British command in war was worse than simply sending them money for dreadnoughts.\n\nIt should be said that this wasn't the only reason for Laurier's electoral defeat in 1911, and an arguably larger reason for his government's downfall was from his \"Canadian-American Reciprocity Treaty\" agreement he made with Taft's United States.  This was a revival of an earlier Reciprocity agreement from 1854-1866 and was sort of a proto-free trade agreement.  Borden's Conservatives made Reciprocity with the US out to be a grave insult to Britain and the Empire (\"how dare we insult Britain by strengthening trade with the Americans!\" kind of thing), and that it would turn control of Canada's economy over to the United States, and so his government ramped-up anti-American sentiment over this issue.  Between Reciprocity and the Naval Services Act, Borden made Laurier out to be something of a traitor to the Empire in English Canada, and the damage to his French Canadian base didn't help either.",

It\u2019s a shame we rely so much on American elections.",

I don;t know if it's the same as other polls I saw before, but i often see a similar amount of ukrainian willing to continue to war WITHOUT ANY CONSESSION.\n\nThat dosen't mean the 37% remaining wants to get down on it's knees, beg russia forgivness and give them everything they want and thank them for it.\n\nIt just mean they are ready for SOME concession ( such as crimea and all), but they won't give up everything though.\n\n  \nIt is, ultimatley, Ukraine choice, of course, i can't blame thoses who are scared for their brother and their sons at the frontlines that want to end it at any cost.

They attacked Kursk, thinking it would be a bargaining chip in later negotiations. All it did was dilute they\u2019re already failing manpower. Now the Russians move forward in the south consistently every day. The Ukrainians have accomplished nothing except now their casualty rate is higher. With the actual situation on the ground and the fact that now 38% of their population will not support this war indefinitely. Do not be surprised if you see elements of the Ukrainian army mutiny, similar to France in 1917, and fight their own government for a peace settlement.",

My brother and his wife are mad that the US is sending money to Ukraine but are silent about Israel. So clearly the issue isn\u2019t about money being sent overseas.\n\nImagine rooting *FOR* Russia in their invasion of a sovereign country, and in the same breath accusing other people of being susceptible to propaganda.",

         "Unfortunately, this has always been a part of the grim calculus for war.\n\nOne of the main reasons WW1 was so impossible to stop once it started was because the casualties were shocking, right from the beginning until the end, but the actual military situation was not changing. No one was making meaningful progress.\n\nEven politicians that opposed the war couldn't bring themselves to publicly support \"it being all for nothing\". It was very bad political optics on top of being a genuinely difficult ethical stance to take. And so the war continued and worsened, with both sides praying to god that, in the end, they could win and make this ever-worsening tragedy be some kind of a force for good (for their nation at least).\n\nI fear we may be reaching that point in this war, as both sides grit their teeth, bear the pain, and push ever harder as the casualties skyrocket.",
         "This is a driving force for both sides. Notably, I recall reading about how this mentality fueled Japanese aggression in mainland Asia.

Unpatriotic and dishonorable.\n\nAlthough I imagine that drive is larger for defending populations.",

The survey was conducted with adult (aged 18 and older) citizens of Ukraine who, at the time of the survey, lived on the territory of Ukraine controlled by the Government of Ukraine. The sample did not include residents of territories that are temporarily not controlled by the authorities of Ukraine (at the same time, part of the respondents are IDPs who moved from the occupied territories), and the survey was not conducted with citizens who went abroad after February 24, 2022.\n\nGood.

         "A long-term war of attrition is bad for Russia too: it doesn't have the credit rating to bring in lots of capital for the war, so the only way it can pay for the war is making taxes higher and higher on the people running Russia's economy, which is going to be a massive problem once those people start making ends meet by doing things like stealing copper meant for the power grid. \n\nI guess it could also put up its infrastructure as collateral for China, but I'm not sure how well replacing all the Russian employees with Chinese ones will go...",

Now, obviously, Russia and Ukraine have a lot of incompatible wargoals, but things like land, money, resources, and sanctions/relief can be exchanged, externally sourced or at least split down the middle, but the issue of security guarantees and NATO membership is a black and white issue that is fundamental to the conflict. If Ukraine gets out of this with guarantees, it has pretty much won, and if it doesn't, Russia has pretty much won., because as you say, they can come back later with more, and Ukraine would be fighting back with even less.\n\nIf Trump or anyone else tries to force a deal with no security guarantees, come hell or high water, Ukraine will fight to the death with anyone trying to impose this. Regardless of who is threatening them, no matter the odds, its an existential imperative, a matter of survival. In contrast, while the Russians obviously aren't giving up without a fight either, it's not an existential threat in the same way. They still have the rest of the Donbass, they still have Crimea, they still have Russia. Hypothetically, there is a point where a certain amount of leverage could move them back.\n\nThere is a possibility that Trump decides to play nuclear chicken against Putin and walk out with a W and that would include a peace deal with security guarantees for Ukraine. Ukraine, in contrast, has already been facing down a game of nuclear chicken since 2014 and hasn't given up yet. The US would face political backlash just for pulling the plug on Ukraine. I guarantee you, The fallout from actually turning against Kyiv is beyond what Mr. very big hands could handle. At the very least, it is a risk that Ukrainians would have a greater willingness to take, in the context of the game of chicken that would be the hypothetical peace negotiations.\n\nIn conclusion, a peace deal with security guarantees that could lead to NATO membership is possible, while a peace deal without security guarantees is no peace at all, and would *never* be accepted. But the most likely scenario is the war just drags on until one side or another has a big enough advantage.",

         "I don't think you would. \n\nOne nuke deployed by Ukraine on contested territory would bring both sides to negotiations.\n\nIt would be a bad idea, but I doubt it would escalate.\n\nThe psychological effects of nuclear deployment in war are not very well understood.\n\nTwo real world examples exist, both were unilateral with regards to military power dynamics. Everyone thinks the use of a nuclear weapon will result in a shootout like effect, rational and what I would like to believe as well as MAD is really just a coping strategy for the proliferation of nuclear weapons.\n\nI'd argue it's more likely to be a similar incident to the deployment of chemical weapons used in the Syrian civil war or Iraq-Iran conflict. It will be condemned by the international community, a lot of posturing and saber rattling will happen, but I doubt anyone would follow-up the attack with another. The fear of MAD works in both directions of a nuclear attack. It's always been a deterrent for rational decisions, but when a nation faces annihilation, rationality becomes a victim of desperation.\n\nThis is why nuclear weapons work as a deterrent to war in reality. Because at the end of a nation's existence, if it has nuclear weapons it will, use them.",
         "Yeah, also as shitty as it sounds, there\u2019s a nonzero chance Ukraine loses this war, and then those weapons are in russias hands. Not that they need them per se, but that\u2019d be a huge fuckup by the us or whoever. Remember how pissed everyone got when they left helicopters in Afghanistan and the taliban tried to fly them? Itd be so much worse.",
         "Turkey is not in the EU...",
         "If Ukraine nuked Moscow it's unclear what the Russian response would be, given that any Russian response would mean the end of the Russian state.  There'd be no ambiguity as to who escalated to that point when it's Russian armies in Ukraine and Russian refusal to respect Ukraine's ultimatum to get out or get nuked.  My guess is people around Putin and whatever other hardliners would simply murder them and seek peace.\n\nIs there any good reason to let the Russian state impose death and horror on Ukrainian civilians when merely the threat of nuclear reprisal should be enough to end the horror?  If the promise of Ukrainian nuclear launch wouldn't be enough isn't that all the more reason to end this Russian government, ASAP?",
         "Wouldn't that be a good thing for the world if ukraine nukes moscow and then get nuked in return? It'd be great for nuclear disarmament. Much less nukes all of a sudden. Russia is no longer a threat. And ukraine war is over.\n\nKinda sounds like you're in support of nuke exchange between the two.

         "That's the reality of the matter. It would be great if it wasn't that way but the fact is that European forces don't scare Russia. The UK and France have a small expeditionary capability and maybe the Netherlands has a tiny one but for the most part European militaries are treated as\u00a0defence forces. European forces may defend against a Russian attack but I don't think Russia is scared of that. The US is the only country I can think of which would respond to an attack with strikes against key infrastructure in Russia.",
         "They'll fight for their own territory but I don't think they'll fight for Ukraine in a way which will scare Russia. Russia is perfectly happy to fight a war of attrition so just holding the line isn't enough.

Whilst with the US overwhelming air strikes in response to attacks is the norm.",
         "Your comment implied that the Germans were advancing (or at least maintaining their gains) when the armistice was signed, they were not, the Spring offensive was long over. If it had broken the stalemate, it had done so in favor of the Entente.\n\n(Also small nitpicky point, both initial German offensives (Invasion of Belgium + Battle of the Frontiers) took more ground than the Spring Offensive.)\n\nThe Germans were being thoroughly defeated by the Hundred Days offensive and this is what led the German General Staff to plan for a post Wilhelm II Germany & peace with the Entente, far more than the homefront collapsing.\n\nThere's also plenty of occasions in history where territorial gains have in fact decided wars.",

         "As we've seen in Ukraine, it's a higher ratio on a modern battlefield, where drones and accurate, long-range artillery can spot and attack an advancing force miles away. \n\nThere is a wide no-man's land, and entering it from either side results in a quick, deadly, and accurate response from the other. \n\nTo get around this and keep pressure on Ukrainian society, Russia uses long-range cruise missiles and drones to attack infrastructure and cities, but this is not effective against a dug-in defender-in-depth who is spread along thousands of miles of front-line, which is why these missiles and drones are not targeting the army in the east.\n\nAgain, there is an even larger advantage now for the defender, which is only overtaken by an overwhelming manpower advantage in isolated areas and for a brief amount of time before a new no-man's-land is established.",

Who knows how the rest of the war would have gone?\n\nHell, the Fins fought alone against the Soviet Union, another hopeless war, and archieved a stalemate.\n\nAlso, when the current war in Ukraine started, a lot of people were adamant that Ukraine would fall in two weeks (as the Russians planned), and yet here we are, in year three of the special military operation. \n\nNow if we followed your reasoning, we should all just knuckle under, everywhere, Russia might get angry.\n\nGuess when Putin tries to invade Europe in a few years, we should all just surrender, it is totally hopeless. In fact, better surrender prematurely like Hungary, give up on freedom and democracy, we had a nice run. Wouldnt want to make the Tzar angry, though.",

         "Not the OP in question, but it is beyond obvious by now that the only way to really* get security is to have nuclear weapons. Every single move of support made is around \"how much do we have to hold back so the enemy doesn't launch nukes\", so it's being showcased that having nukes means a lot more security in the form of deterrence",
         "Nuclear nonproliferation is based on the idea of a rules based international order in which a nuclear power does not simply engage in threatening a thermonuclear exchange to get what it wants. Obviously that taboo has been broken. To be safe a nation needs to either have no enemies, have a nuclear deterrent, or shelter under the aegis of a nation with a nuclear deterrent. The primary nuclear aegis is the United States which has openly expressed a disinterest in continuing to underwrite the security of its allies.\n\nNuclear weapons aren\u2019t that hard to get for developed states with existing nuclear industries. Ukraine, Japan, South Korea etc. could all get them relatively easily. Iran only refuses to cross the finish line on theirs because they judge it to be more trouble than it\u2019s worth but they\u2019ve completed the tech. South Africa made them decades ago. \n\nWhen faced with an expansionist nuclear armed neighbour that demonstrates a willingness to engage in nuclear blackmail the requirement for a sovereign deterrent is clear. Americans will always say \u201cwhy should we die in a nuclear exchange rather than accept the loss of one inch of Latvian soil\u201d. When push comes to shove the American alliance is not credible, they can, have, and will be intimidated. To paraphrase cryptobros, not your nukes, not your deterrent.\n\nBut even if nuclear blackmail had not been extremely successful these last few years, there\u2019s still the problem of American isolationism. A large portion of the American political spectrum favour the unilateral dismantling of the American alliance network. Maybe not this year, maybe they\u2019ll never do it, but it\u2019s far too close to risk national survival on it. If it\u2019s a 50:50 that the US will still be in NATO when Russia invades then you need to develop your own nukes.\n\nNonproliferation no longer makes sense. It\u2019s a policy from a different time based on different assumptions.",
         "Any Ukrainian nuclear weapons would be far back and moved out before any Russians might get their hands on them.  Ukraine gave the Soviets back their nukes back in the day because they weren't worth much to Ukraine in any case because Ukraine didn't have the launch codes.  Ukraine could've salvaged the enriched uranium/plutonium but it would've had to make it into a new warhead.",
         "True, they are in the process of joining the EU and have many of the benefits of the EU without being in it\u2026",
         "Why do you think it\u2019s unclear what the Russian response would be?",
         "I don\u2019t support nuclear weapons being given to countries that are fair weather friends of the U.S./NATO.",
         "I\u2019m aware.",
         "It wouldn\u2019t screw the EU up if they didn\u2019t spend as much on their social programs that drives their deficit spending. Do you actually think the eurozone crisis was muricas fault?",
         "I\u2019m not saying they don\u2019t? Listen if you\u2019re down with pulling the US out of Israel I\u2019d be 100% for it. They\u2019re fair weather friends just like Ukraine, I have no love for either of them.",
         "the 3:1 ratio(not rule) has nothing to do with casualties and was mostly used for medieval sieges as the ratio of attacker troops to defender troops(aka, the attacker should have 3x more men). The reason for that ratio is that the attacker takes more casualties initially when the phase of creating a breach is happening and/or scaling the walls, but afterwards, as long as they can bring in more men to the breach and exploit it(also a reason why they want 3x more men), the defenders can take more casualties than the attackers due to them being virtually wiped out, as its quite impossible to escape a siege alive, unless the commander of the army allows you to",
         "They are definitely using cruise/ballistic missiles in the East. Russia uses drones and cruise/ballistic missiles to target high value targets such as air defense and HIMARs providing support to the front lines. Every single HIMARS and Patriot loss in the past year or two has been to Russia spotting it out with an Orlan drone and then sending an Iskander at it. A good chunk of Ukrainian armor losses have been to lancets. SU 34s often use air launched cruise missiles on frontline positions, though recently UMPK glide bombs are more common because they're cheaper/more cost effective.",
         "Soviet (Russian) doctrine calls for something like 10:1 advantage to attack, but that 10:1 can be achieved with offensive support like artillery.\u00a0\n\n\n3:1 is the traditional \"a prepared defender can defend against a force three times its size if equally equipped.\"\n\n\nThat is for a deliberate attack though, and the war of attrition isn't a deliberate attack. The traditional ratios play a part in individual battles but not the overall conflict.",
         "Okay. What is the attacker to defender casualty rate for the israel gaza war? Or either invasions of iraq? What about the us war against afghanistan? Or the soviet afghan war? Armenia vs azerbaijan? Bosnian war?\n\n\nIt's not applicable to modern wars. Now it's determined by technology and firepower.",
         "He's just wrong. Of course being on the defense is an advantage on the modern battlefield. Assaulting fortified positions is hard.",

Even if we assume the statement \"the only way to get security is to have nukes\" is true (a statement which is problematic, to put it mildly), you can't derive \"nuclear nonproliferation is dead\". This is the so-called \"non-sequitur\" logical fallacy. Perhaps other countries can't get/make nukes even if they wanted to, in effect affirming the nuclear nonproliferation?\n\n2. Now, for the statement \"the only way to get security is having nukes\" itself: there are many countries I can think of that don't have nukes, yet they're pretty secure. Are New Zealand or Switzerland not really secure countries? On the other hand, Israel is known to have nukes, and yet that didn't seem to stop many neighboring countries from attacking it at some point in history. Or even Russia - although Russia is in possession of the largest nuclear arsenal in the World, that is seemingly not enough to secure the Kursk region from being invaded, or their refineries attacked.",

The Ukrainian women should be conscripted to do roles according to their ability to support the war effort - for some that'd be combat, others support roles etc. It's disgustingly unfair that they're cheering on the war without being willing to make personal sacrifices."

How is it that they left for *\"bein hazmanim\"* (vacation) for a month in the summer? Why do they get to go home every evening to their families instead of sitting and learning Torah while the soldier out in the field doesn't? And most of all, why is their study of Torah worth more than the study of Torah that actual religious soldiers are doing in the battlefield? There have been more than a dozen IDF soldiers killed with a Talmud in the bag on their back in the battlefield, why didn't it save them? Because **Torah study doesn't save lives; soldiers do!**",

It's basically \"voulenteering\" for a year in what the country needs at the time. They work for non-profits, hospitals, MADA, government ministries and the like. And by the way, if suddenly all these people were drafted by force, the country would fall apart, Israel needs them as well as the soldiers. Some serve on the front lines and some on the home front. It's not the same, but it's enough.",

No disrespect to the women of the IDF meant personally, just explaining. but a good # of Israelis I\u2019ve spoken too are pretty traditional and actually strongly against expanding combat roles for women, the court actually had to force the military to start training female tank crews, they didn\u2019t want to.\u00a0",

It was peer pressure, $$, schooling and career promises, and effective marketing. What stopped me actually, was my Veteran grandfathers. Both of whom told me these wars were pointless and messes. They said the Middle East is never clean, and wouldn\u2019t be as quick as the government was claiming.  And yes, after 9/11 everyone was ready to sign up and bomb everything. I was a sophomore in high school during 9/11. So it was right at the age when the US was mobilizing and looking for recruits and offering a lot to join and get friends to join.",
