He decided not to vote, which is sad in a way, but it's one less vote for Trump, so I suppose it's a win.

But I started getting second thoughts about it recently. \n\nI am not a Democrat or a Republican. I disagree with the Democrats (and Reddit) on a lot of issues. But this morning, I was thinking about the Supreme Court. I thought about Trump's actions following the 2020 election, and how the Supreme Court recently gave him immunity for what he did. I realized how much I despise the current Supreme Court for that and so many other things. It's more than just policy. I believe that this Supreme Court is flat out corrupt and I didn't want to reward them. \n\nI won't lie. I'm worried. I don't like the Biden-Harris economy and I want the 2019 economy back. But the economy has been getting a bit better lately, and I really don't like the current Supreme Court. Voting for Harris felt like voting against them. So that's what I did.\n\n**Edit:** Thanks for all the comments. I would like to note, I am well aware that Trump inherited a great situation from Obama and that Biden inherited a pandemic. What really frustrated me was how long the recovery took. I know it was a once in a lifetime event, but I thought we'd get over it faster than this.

It also can take a couple years for legislative policy to take effect (meaning the 2017-2019 economy was sort of set up by Obama's policies). Trump's biggest proposed policy, tariffs, would be a tax increase on everybody and a massive price increase throughout the supply chain, bad enough that it could lead to recession and would make the 2021-22 inflation look quaint.",

The price issues you're seeing, especially at the grocery store, are now mostly the result of corporate greed. They know everyone needs food and we were willing to pay the high prices back when inflation was high, because we don't have a choice. We're still going to be shopping at grocery stores, and the cuts we'll have to make in order to be able to afford to eat will have to come from somewhere else. You're already seeing fast food prices start to drop again because a lot of people just cut that out entirely once it got too expensive. But groceries? They can screw us sideways and we'll still have to shop there. They used inflation as a convenient excuse to keep prices high, and people still think we have massive inflation as a result. Call me a socialist, but if a business is involved in selling something that is necessary for continued existence, the government should be able to step in and limit price-gouging. \n\nAlso, anyone concerned about the price of eggs in specific should know that there's a massive H5 bird flu outbreak. Started in wild birds, spread to poultry farms, and now the poultry farm workers are coming down with it. Not good. I shopped for eggs this weekend.

I feel like it is the sociopolitical institutions of certain churches saying this, rather than faith inspired by a balanced reading of the Bible. How can abortion or marijuana, things not even mentioned explicitly (only by joining together verses) be more important than the actual words of Jesus himself calling out hypocrites and helping the sick and poor, or the Ten Commandments handed down by God himself on Mt. Sinai, calling out the sins of adultery, lying and jealousy. I also question why many self-professed Christians feel the need to make sin illegal. Although it is not our place to judge, wouldn't God give them a greater punishment anyway?\n\nAt the end of the day, most Christians should be agree that what makes one a Christian is belief in Jesus' divinity and his plan for salvation, not how you vote.\n\nSorry if I came off a little ranty: It really bothers me though how many people use the name of Jesus to hurt people and selectively pick Christian doctrine to suit their needs. It reminds me of the chopped up Bibles they gave to control the slaves. For the record, I myself am a Christian, although I am distrustful of the institution of the church currently and am unchurched at the moment. I also acknowledge the Bible can be interpreted a lot of ways, and there are a lot of Christian faith traditions that have widely varying views on both scripture and social issues.",

Abortion wasn\u2019t even a big Christian issue or controversial until the 70\u2019s or so, when a branch of wackos who seemed to primarily want to get rich off their congregation and control women seized power.

I don't know her faith journey,  but to me,  I will be able to justify putting my beliefs into action more by supporting her over Trump.  I have a bad feeling that we have lost the youth by seeing their Jesus loving parents voting for Trump and not being able up reconcile those two things. \n\nAs for abortion/pro choice, my argument is that the law of the land doesn't push people to have them,  it just gives them an option.   I'd love to see all the money and effort that goes to prolife to instead focus on reaching women in crisis and making adoption a realistic option for more Americans.  If you belive in a sovereign God, he knows what is going to happen with the pregnancy.  He doesn't need laws to help that, and we are not a Christian nation so it's ok if the laws of the land don't always reflect Christian views. \n\nWeed I'm more pragmatic.

They dress the wound of my people as though it were not serious. \u2018Peace, peace,\u2019 they say, when there is no peace. Are they ashamed of their detestable conduct? No, they have no shame at all; they do not even know how to blush.\u201d Jeremiah 6:14-16 \n\nIn this passage from the Bible, God is upset. The religious people of the day are exploiting harmful problems for personal, political gain and not addressing their true solutions. They act like they care, but intentionally allow the issues to remain unresolved. They outwardly insist that they desire a way forward, but inwardly they have no real desire at all. \n\nTrump and many conservative Evangelicals treat \u201cabortion\u201d the same. They outwardly declare that they are \u201cpro-life\u201d and detest abortion. They feverishly rant against how many \u201cbabies\u201d are being murdered. Many make abortion their defining issue as to the reason why they support Trump. They posture themselves as wanting to make it illegal, as if that was the cure. It all looks and sounds so spiritual to the casual observer. Yet, inwardly, they have little-to-no heart for a real solution. For if they did, they would be addressing, providing for, and adopting the proven remedies that positively impact abortion. But, they don\u2019t. \n\nInstead, with deceit, they want to keep the abortion issue alive because it manipulates their voters. It\u2019s a political false flag, the last card they have in their deck. Without it, they have no drum to beat and no provocative enemy upon which to summon their troops to fight. The need to create the illusion that they lead the way against abortion while making sure it remains unresolved, that they might remain in power. \n\nIn fact, perfectly credible and widely known statistics show that abortion rates have gone down significantly with the kind of Democratic leadership that approaches abortion wholistically and addresses the real issues that can bring real change. Yet sadly, these same statistics reveal that under Republican leadership, abortion significantly increases\u2013that\u2019s the facts. Yet, with Trump at their side, conservatives \u201ddo not even know how to blush\u201d at the truth about abortion, how they expoit it, and how they resist actual remedies. Instead, they declare \u201cPro-life, pro-life\u201d where there is no pro-life among them. All in hopes of drowning the biblical voice crying out in the wilderness, \u201cMake straight the ways of the Lord to heal abortion and cure its causes.\u201d  \n\nLike most people, I detest abortion. I want to see it become a non-issue in our society. I want to see it remedied by real people who really care, who are willing to apply the difficult, but real solutions that work. I\u2019m tired of people who are more interested in politics than life.\n\nThat\u2019s why I can\u2019t vote for Trump, the Bible tells me so.",
         "Funny thing, there actually IS a part of the Bible that talks about abortion - and the only mention of it is how to properly perform it as a test of the woman's \"faithfulness\" to her husband (Numbers 5: 11-31 if you're curious).",

         "I completely agree",
         "Or, how about unrepentant sin.\n\nMost everyone agrees that sin is bad. Even Trump supporters acknowledge that he is an overly sinful man. All of the Seven Deadly Sins listed in the Bible, Trump blatantly exudes\u2013no question about that. In fact, for some Trump supporters, they love his rebellious spirit, even against God. Yet, right in the face of the Bible, Christians who support Trump wave their many flags of excuses such as, \u201cEveryone sins,\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re not electing a pastor\u201d or, \u201cLook at David in the Bible, he sinned, but God used him.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, those statements are true. However, in Scripture, there is a huge, defining difference. God never raised up anyone for leadership who didn\u2019t first repent of their sins. Not one, period. Scripturally, repentance has always been a precursor for being lifted up by God.\n\nYet, without any pause in their biblical steps, for many Christians who support Trump, they believe God anointed Him for leadership and to do His will in America and beyond. However, given the fact that Trump has never repented of his sins, even when given the chance, this is a biblical impossibility. In fact, in many conservative Evangelical churches, Trump couldn\u2019t even qualify to become their janitor without a repentance of sins, but somehow he can become their God-appointed President?\n\nStill to this day, Trump refuses to repent. How do I know? The \u201cfruits of repentance\u201d that John the Baptist insisted upon in Scripture are nowhere to be found in Trump. \n\n\u201cBut when John saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his place of baptism, he said to them, \u2018You brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the coming wrath? Produce fruit, then, in keeping with repentance.\u2019\u201d Mathew 3:7-8\n\nTrump is undeniably the same lying, profane, greedy, mocking, bullying, divisive, jealous, arrogant, narcissistic, and hateful man he was at the beginning of his presidency. That\u2019s not a judgement, it\u2019s an inescapable observation. Despite the lipstick Evangelicals want to put on this pig, God is not interested in Trump\u2019s appearances of meeting with Evangelicals, closing his eyes during prayers, randomly using Christian jargon, or waving a Bible around. Instead, He is interested in a humble, genuinely contrite heart. Sadly, a heart Trump neither has nor apparently desires.\n\nAs Jesus warned in Scripture, no unrepented, sin-ladened Trump-like tree can \u201cproduce good fruit.\u201d \n\nI want divine goodness for America. I want integrity and decency in our leadership. I want humble, teachable, kind people at the helm who show strength through maturity and stability.\n\nThat\u2019s why I can\u2019t vote for Trump, the Bible tells me so.\n\nBut, what about the lies?\n\nYes, 20,000 documented lies or misleading statements since Trump was elected. Certainly, by now, he must be giving the Father of Lies a run for his money. With this blatant stronghold of deceit and lying manifested in Trump\u2019s life and leadership, to willfully follow him, vote for him, or give him loyalty is to pledge yourself to evil, is it not? How can it be anything different?\n\n\u201cNo one who practices deceit shall dwell in my house; no one who utters lies shall continue before my eyes.\u201d Psalm 101:7\n\n\u201cEloquent lips are unsuited to a godless fool\u2014how much worse lying lips to a ruler!\u201d Proverbs 17:7\n\n\u201cLying lips are an abomination to the Lord\u201d Proverbs 12:22\n\nMost Christian Trump supporters insist that the LGBTQ community is biblically declared an \u201cabomination\u201d to the Lord and should never be supported, followed, or given influence in our society. Yet, these same Christians joyfully give a man, who the Bible declares as a lying \u201cabomination,\u201d their praise, worship, and anointing as a healthy, worthy, divine leader. How can this possibly be? For it\u2019s certainly not biblical.\n\n\u201cLet me describe for you a worthless and a wicked man; first, he is a constant liar; he signals his true intentions to his friends with eyes and feet and fingers. He is always thinking up new schemes to swindle people. He stirs up trouble everywhere. But he will be destroyed suddenly, broken beyond hope of healing.\u201d Proverbs 6:12-16\n\nMost recently, Trump was caught lying to the American people about the severity of the  Covid-19 virus. Once again, declaring \u201cPeace, peace\u201d where there is no peace. In fact, long after he knew about the lethal severity of the virus he labeled it a \u201choax.\u201d Trump lied, 200,000 people have died. \n\nThe Bible clearly teaches, nothing of God ever comes from lying. \n\nI want a truthful President. I want leadership that places honesty over personal gain. I want to be led by people who believe that \u201cthe truth shall set you free,\u201d even if that truth is unpopular, difficult, or alarming. I want the Father of Lies not to be an object of political aspiration, but the subject of human and societal rejection. \n\nThat\u2019s why I can\u2019t vote for Trump, the Bible tells me so.",
         "Ok. My Christian church I grew up in has members that hate trump. A lot\u00a0",
         "Enter, the immigrant, refugee, and the foreigner.\n\nNo one wants illegal immigration or open borders as a national policy, regardless of how conservative Evangelical Trump supporters label the position of progressives. Once again, Trump supporters seem to relish in creating issues that aren\u2019t real to deflect from addressing the ones that are.\n\nIf America is a Christian nation, what happens when immigration (illegal or not) happens? How, biblically, are we to treat the foreigners and immigrants among us, no matter how they arrive? What happens with refugees who come to our border? And, how are we to biblically treat those who seek asylum and new life within our country?\n\nThe Bible has crystal clear answers.\n\n\u201cDo not mistreat or oppress a foreigner, for you were foreigners in Egypt.\u201d Exodus 22:21\n\n\u201cWhen the alien resides with you in your land, you shall not oppress the alien. The alien who resides with you shall be to you as a citizen among you; you shall love the alien as yourself, for you were aliens in the land of Egypt:  I am the Lord your God.\u201d Leviticus 19:33-34\n\n\u201cWhen you reap the harvest of your land, do not reap to the very edges of your field or gather the gleanings of your harvest. Do not go over your vineyard a second time or pick up the grapes that have fallen. Leave them for the poor and the foreigner.\u201d Leviticus 19:9-10\n\n\u201cAs for the foreigner who does not belong to your people Israel but has come from a distant land because of your name\u2014 for they will hear of your great name and your mighty hand and your outstretched arm\u2014when they come and pray toward this temple, then hear from heaven, your dwelling place. Do whatever the foreigner asks of you, so that all the peoples of the earth may know your name and fear you, as do your own people Israel, and may know that this house I have built bears your Name.\u201d (1 Kings 8:41-44)\n\n\u201cThen I will draw near to you for judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers and against the adulterers and against those who swear falsely, and against those who oppress the wage earner in his wages, the widow and the orphan, and those who turn aside the alien and do not fear Me,\u201d says the Lord of hosts.\u201d Malachi 3:5\n\n\u201cFor the Lord your God\u2026loves the strangers, providing them food and clothing.  You shall also love the stranger, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt.\u201d Deuteronomy 10:18-19\n\n\u201cThe Lord watches over the strangers\u2026\u201d Psalm 146\n\n\u201cThe aliens shall be to you as citizens, and shall also be allotted an inheritance.\u201d Ezekiel 47:21\n\n\u201c\u2026I was a stranger and you welcomed me.\u201d Matthew 25:31 (Jesus speaking)\n\nNotice, Jesus doesn\u2019t say they, \u201ccaged me,\u201d \u201cabused me,\u201d \u201cneutered me,\u201d \u201cseparated me from family,\u201d \u201cstarved me,\u201d \u201cmade immigration nearly impossible for me,\u201d \u201cmocked me,\u201d \u201cslandered me,\u201d or \u201cmurdered me.\u201d  \n\nNo, he said of His true followers, they \u201cwelcomed\u201d me. \n\nSadly, this is not the policy of president Trump, nor the Republicans, nor the desires of many of his Christian supporters, even the ones who claim their faithfulness to the Bible and its infallible inerrancy. What God admonishes, they resist.  \n\nFor if you take the Scriptures seriously, the immigrant, the refugee, and the foreigner should not just be \u201cwelcomed\u201d with sacrificial hospitality, but \u201cwanted\u201d as God\u2019s own favored blessing. They should be lifted high among all others. They should be loved, protected, and provide for with the same passion we love, protect, and provide for ourselves. They are not to be objects of resentment, oppression, rejection, exploitation, or inconvenience. Rather, they should be honored as angels sent from above. They are us, and we are them. For in Christ, \u201cthere is neither Jew nor Gentile.\u201d\n\nI want a country in sync with God\u2019s heart for the immigrant, the foreigner, the alien, and refugee. I want a country in step with God\u2019s biblical, unconditional \u201cwelcome,\u201d \u201cwant,\u201d and generous care for those outside of our borders who desire to come, live, and find new life within us.  \n\nThat\u2019s why I can\u2019t vote for Trump, the Bible tells me so.",
         "But perhaps, most of all, loving your neighbor as yourself.\n\n\u201c\u2018Love your neighbor as yourself.\u2019 There is no commandment greater than these.\u201d Matthew 12:31\n\n\u201cBut I say, love your enemies! Pray for those who persecute you!\u201d Matthew 5:44\n\nThere is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear, because fear has to do with punishment. The one who fears is not made perfect in love. 1 John 4:18\n\nAs a former white, conservative Evangelical pastor of 20 years, I know deeply how the system works. I\u2019m not trying to slam the faith or the people within it, but the unbiblical evils must be chased out of the shadows, especially the hate of love among so many.\n\nFor most everything within white, conservative Evangelicalism isn\u2019t focused on having a neighbor to love, but rather based upon having an enemy that must be hated. Fear of these enemies is the ultimate motivator, not love. They will create it, fabricate it, and inflame it. For they are nothing without fear and the hate it awakens\u2026\n\nIf we love minorities as ourselves, they\u2019ll take over the church and society, and we\u2019ll lose our white church, white way of life, and white power. \n\nIf we love black people as ourselves with true equality, true police accountability, true legal fairness, true economic justice, and true opportunity, we\u2019ll have to admit our racism and white privilege, lose our white way of life, and surrender our white power.\n\nIf we love our wives as ourselves and remove the requirement that they must submit to us unquestionably, they\u2019ll take over the family, usurp male power, and run the church and society into the ground.\n\nIf we love the LGBTQ community as ourselves, our patriarchal power will be dismantled, God will punish our life, and all of white, male-driven, conservative Christianity will be flushed down the drain.\n\nIf we love special needs people as ourselves, we\u2019ll have to make an honored and equal place for them in society, overpowering our \u201cnormal\u201d lives with inconvenience. \n\nIf we love the least-of-these as ourselves with economic equality, free health care, free college, a living wage, social security, long-term care, and the removal of poverty, we won\u2019t be able to fund our industrial military complex and foster our diabolical economic system of socialism for top and capitalism for the bottom.  \n\nIf we love the environment as ourselves with significant building and development restrictions, environmental controls, and clean energy standards and investments, we won\u2019t be able to feed our insatiable appetites for economic and personal greed. \n\n\u201cDepart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink, I was a stranger and you did not invite me in, I needed clothes and you did not clothe me, I was sick and in prison and you did not look after me.\u2019 They also will answer, \u2018Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison, and did not help you?\u2019 He will reply, \u2018I tell you the truth, whatever you did not do for one of the least among you, you did not do for me.\u2019\u201d -Matthew 25:41-45\n\n\u201cHe who oppresses the poor to increase his wealth and he who gives gifts to the rich\u2013both come to poverty.\u201d -Proverbs 22:16\n\n\u201cNow this was the sin of your sister Sodom: She and her daughters were arrogant, overfed and unconcerned; they did not help the poor and needy.\u201d -Ezekiel 16:49\n\n\u201cThere is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.\u201d Galatians 3:28\n\n\u201cIf you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, \u201cLove your neighbor as yourself,\u201d you are doing right. But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers.\u201d James 2:8-9",
         "See, where God admonishes that our highest motivation should be the unconditional love and care for all of humanity equally, in contrast, there is truly no other fuel that drives the Evangelical Death Star than having enemies to fear, hate, marginalize, fight, and treat unequally.\n\nThis is why Trump has the addictive support and allegiance of most conservative Evangelicals. For the only thing they understand is fear, and Trump speaks their language like no other. He mocks special needs people, bullies his perceived enemies, embraces racism, fosters white supremacy, mistreats women, ignites division, worships greed, and loves himself above all things.\n\nBiblically, this is the ultimate blaspheme of the Spirit.\n\nTo see love as the enemy.\n\nTo see fear as the friend.\n\nTo see enemies as the goal.\n\nTo fight at all cost, with lies, violence, duplicity, and sin.\n\nTo see a white, conservative, Republican, American Jesus as the way, truth, and life.\n\nTo see white, conservative Evangelicalism as the Kingdom.\n\nI want a President with whom love is greater than fear. I want a country where to love all people equally is a friend and not an enemy. I want the character of a great person, a great society, a great economy, and a great nation to be defined by their love for all people equally, not fear nor hate. \n\nThat\u2019s why I can\u2019t vote for Trump, the Bible tells me so. \n\nGrace is brave. Be brave."

That ends today. Don't get me wrong, Kamala is far from being an ideal candidate for me, but I'm too scared to find out what America will become with another Trump presidency. Seeing how much of a sore loser he was in 2020, how isolationist he wants America to be, how unwilling he is to challenge Putin or Russia, and how rabid he's allowed his base to become have all made this an easy decision for me.

Kinzinger I definitely understand and could get behind. \n\nBut the problem is always going to be whether Republicans remain the party of taking away from Americans instead of giving to them.

Mine is still going strong at 88.  \n\nMy parents were happily married for over 60 years until my mother passed in 2021\n\nI see in Kamala a women who is strong and fierce when she needs to be but that strength is tempered by kindness and strong family values (real family values not that fake pageantry you see put on for the benefit of the cameras)\n\nTomorrow, we make history and hopefully begin the long journey towards healing as a country.\n\nAnd recognize that together we are strong, divided we will fall\n\nI await the hour when we can honestly call her \u201cPresident Elect Kamala Harris\u201d\n\nNow, what are you waiting for?

Trump bragged about sexually assaulting women before 2016 and still won. \n\nBut telling someone what they can/can't do with their own body? There are a significant number of unreligious Republican women out there where this crossed the line. I think the Republicans know this too, as seen by Trump and Vance both trying to walk-back the party's stance. \n\nI think most people would be surprised to learn that a lot of Republicans only identify as Republican because they think Republicans are the party of the rich and Democrats represents poor people. All their stances on social issues are aligned with Dems. The decades of propaganda have convinced millions of low-information Americans that Republicans make you richer and Democrats take your money for welfare. \"I am rich (or want to be), so therefore I'm a Republican.\"\n\nThe Dobbs/abortion issue however is one of those things where you're directly stripping a right away from someone that has been there for decades. Something like this is powerful enough for people to put their party affiliation aside and not vote out of disgust. \n\nIf the Dems suddenly pushed through a decision that men can't have shoulder-length hair (for example), it would be the same reaction I think. Even though there are millions and millions of men that don't and never will have longer hair, there'd be a fair number of Dems that didn't vote (or flipped to the other party) just because the principle of the thing. \n\nThey thought the Dobbs decision was going to be a boost going into this election and empower their base or something. I think if they just waited until Trump won in 2024 to push this stuff through we'd have a much much scarier situation.",

What exactly have you done to speak out against that decision, other than vote (which is the bare minimum)?\n\nEmotions are high right now, and an apology from you would be happily accepted if you are so inclined.
