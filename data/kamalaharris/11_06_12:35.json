All they care about is how much it costs to put food on the table, and it's a lot more expensive than it was 4 years ago. There are a lot of people in America who live paycheck to paycheck, and there are a lot of seniors on a fixed income.  I voted for Kamala, and my whole family did.  I have significantly benefited from the booming stock market.  Most Americans can't scrap up $1000 for an emergency.  On top of high prices, it was ludicrous for the Biden Administration to let so many undocumented immigrants into the country.  He played right into Trump's hand, and Trump took advantage of that.  I know he killed the Bipartisan Immigration Bill, but it was after Biden allowed so many immigrants into the country.  You may not like this message, but that is why he won.  I thought Kamala ran a great campaign.  She's a gifted politician, much better than Clinton.  She organized her campaign in record time and came very close to winning.  I didn't know much about her before she became the nominee, but she really impressed me with her energy.  I hope the Democrats will learn from this.  Immigration is their blindspot, just as abortion is for the GOP.  If Trump sticks to his promise and reports them all, America will quickly learn the value they've brought when prices skyrocket again.",

Getting out to overlooked rural communities and smaller cities is where she should have been, and it was gnawing at me that she wasn't doing this.

Which is nearly 15 million fewer votes than what Biden got. \n\nAnd even Hillary Clinton in 2016 got 65. 853,514 votes. \n\nHarris shortfall vs. Biden = -18% = a near collapse of the Democratic Party \n\nReally ??? \n\n15,000,000 votes fewer than Biden................... how does that make sense ?\n\nAnd the abortion amendment votes came in ahead of Harris everywhere.

As I heard Chris Christie say, loosely, it's people pissed off about grocery store prices. End loose quote.  That's the number 1 issue.  As a whole, both parties, that's what hurts the wallet, and makes people vote.  Maybe it made some democrats not vote.  Maybe it made a lot of Trump fans vote.

But in hindsight, it's obvious to me she just wasn't popular enough among moderate middle of the road voters. Even right up until election day, the number of people I saw interviewed that said they were undecided because they still somehow didn't know enough about her is baffling. Biden dropping out way too late and not having an actual primary I think really hurt the dems. Not only did it cost them the white house, it also cost them congress.

All while the right encouraged the idea of Fake News and twisted truths. \n\nNow, in 2024, they can theoretically commit mass fraud and throw all of the Left's statements back in their face if they call them on it. If anything comes to light, they spout off about Fake News and misinformation. \n\nTrump hoodwinked the entire country. \n\nI just hope, with the slimmest little glimmer, because Al Gore and Bush's election was crazy.. that maybe, just maybe, something historic will happen. That democracy will prevail. That any fraud comes to light casting doubt on his count. That anyone's votes that weren't counted because their ballot boxes were under threat or bombed (look up headlines)... That they are able to still somehow fulfill their patriotic duty. That Kamala doesn't concede, and the hopeful truth comes to light. \n\nThat maybe it's her that is sworn in on inauguration day when this all ends.\n\nOur history has been stained with darkness, time, and time again, and the People did not lay down for it. We spoke out, and stood our ground. We can again. \n\nI just hope that good will prevail, no matter how naive that may sound. It is human. I am human. We are human. I hope for our humanity.

Nor did she in her Rally\u2019s or during interviews. I think it was a huge mistake because they laser focused on her comment that she had never been to the border and inflamed the lies regarding border numbers and all blame on her. Plus gas prices and groceries which I hear so many complain about. I think these truly hurt her by not confronting head on and debunking!!!",

Also people simply not believing a woman should be our image of representing the president of the United States\u2014 it\u2019s unfortunate, but a WOC Madame President in the current state of hate and division that has been witnessed numerous times in U.S. history is really a dream you desperately wish can happen, but in reality too many men\u2014even some women\u2014truly will forever consider women less than dirt.",

I\u2019m Jewish, but was raised in a very Christian area with a Christian parent. From what I can see, there\u2019s nothing in the modern Republican Party that Christ would condone. Abortion wasn\u2019t even a big Christian issue or controversial until the 70\u2019s or so, when a branch of wackos who seemed to primarily want to get rich off their congregation and control women seized power.

         "I think a major problem in Christianity right now is viewing support for certain social issues as what makes one a \"good\" christian. I feel like it is the sociopolitical institutions of certain churches saying this, rather than faith inspired by a balanced reading of the Bible. How can abortion or marijuana, things not even mentioned explicitly (only by joining together verses) be more important than the actual words of Jesus himself calling out hypocrites and helping the sick and poor, or the Ten Commandments handed down by God himself on Mt. Sinai, calling out the sins of adultery, lying and jealousy. I also question why many self-professed Christians feel the need to make sin illegal. Although it is not our place to judge, wouldn't God give them a greater punishment anyway?\n\nAt the end of the day, most Christians should be agree that what makes one a Christian is belief in Jesus' divinity and his plan for salvation, not how you vote.\n\nSorry if I came off a little ranty: It really bothers me though how many people use the name of Jesus to hurt people and selectively pick Christian doctrine to suit their needs. It reminds me of the chopped up Bibles they gave to control the slaves.

I don't know her faith journey,  but to me,  I will be able to justify putting my beliefs into action more by supporting her over Trump.  I have a bad feeling that we have lost the youth by seeing their Jesus loving parents voting for Trump and not being able up reconcile those two things. \n\nAs for abortion/pro choice, my argument is that the law of the land doesn't push people to have them,  it just gives them an option.   I'd love to see all the money and effort that goes to prolife to instead focus on reaching women in crisis and making adoption a realistic option for more Americans.  If you belive in a sovereign God, he knows what is going to happen with the pregnancy.  He doesn't need laws to help that, and we are not a Christian nation so it's ok if the laws of the land don't always reflect Christian views. \n\nWeed I'm more pragmatic.  People will do it regardless.  Let's get some taxes from it and improve lifestyle in other areas.  Prohibition didn't work for alcohol and doesn't seem it will work here.",

         "\n\nThere are many Trump supporters, who have fallen under the sway of Christian Nationalism, believing they are bringing about \"God's kingdom on Earth.\" The hubris and arrogance is mind-boggling!\n\nMany Trump supporters believe that Trump is or has become Christian, following a path of repenting and starting a new life.\n\nLet\u2019s see:\n\nHe has been caught on tape attacking Gold Star family members and bragging about grabbing women by their genitals. \n\nA jury found him liable for sexually abusing a woman and defaming her. \n\nHe's bragged about extramarital affairs. \n\nA repentant sinner would apologize for these actions and make amends to the victims. Trump has never apologized. He never will.\n\nIn his letter to the Galatians, Saint Paul wrote that \u201cthe fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control.\u201d\nThese fruits are not in Donald Trump. \n\nChristian Nationalism misrepresents the character of God as exclusive and hateful. The Jesus of Christian Nationalism bears little resemblance to the one written about in the four gospels. The Christian Nationalist \u201cJesus\u201d does not teach His followers to beat their swords into plowshares, or to become the meek who will inherit the earth, or to love enemies, or even to love our neighbor as ourselves.\n\nWaving the Bible about without being contrite is hypocrisy. Even more, the selling of the bible with the added constitution and bill of rights, and the lyrics to Lee Greenwood's \"I'm Proud to be An American\" is heresy, it is an abomination!\n\nTo follow someone like that is idolatry. Encourage believers to honestly evaluate Donald Trump by biblical standards.\n\nJesus warned that the final deceptions would be in His name, (Matthew 24). In closing the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus warned about those who profess to do marvelous deeds in His name, but do not know Jesus.\n\nThe final apostasy that places humanity beyond the possibility of repentance and redemption creates a Jesus in our own image and worships a counterfeit Jesus who expects His people to assert God\u2019s authority on earth. \n\nThis is not Christianity!",

They dress the wound of my people as though it were not serious. \u2018Peace, peace,\u2019 they say, when there is no peace. Are they ashamed of their detestable conduct? No, they have no shame at all; they do not even know how to blush.\u201d Jeremiah 6:14-16 \n\nIn this passage from the Bible, God is upset. The religious people of the day are exploiting harmful problems for personal, political gain and not addressing their true solutions. They act like they care, but intentionally allow the issues to remain unresolved. They outwardly insist that they desire a way forward, but inwardly they have no real desire at all. \n\nTrump and many conservative Evangelicals treat \u201cabortion\u201d the same. They outwardly declare that they are \u201cpro-life\u201d and detest abortion. They feverishly rant against how many \u201cbabies\u201d are being murdered. Many make abortion their defining issue as to the reason why they support Trump. They posture themselves as wanting to make it illegal, as if that was the cure. It all looks and sounds so spiritual to the casual observer. Yet, inwardly, they have little-to-no heart for a real solution. For if they did, they would be addressing, providing for, and adopting the proven remedies that positively impact abortion. But, they don\u2019t. \n\nInstead, with deceit, they want to keep the abortion issue alive because it manipulates their voters. It\u2019s a political false flag, the last card they have in their deck. Without it, they have no drum to beat and no provocative enemy upon which to summon their troops to fight. The need to create the illusion that they lead the way against abortion while making sure it remains unresolved, that they might remain in power. \n\nIn fact, perfectly credible and widely known statistics show that abortion rates have gone down significantly with the kind of Democratic leadership that approaches abortion wholistically and addresses the real issues that can bring real change. Yet sadly, these same statistics reveal that under Republican leadership, abortion significantly increases\u2013that\u2019s the facts. Yet, with Trump at their side, conservatives \u201ddo not even know how to blush\u201d at the truth about abortion, how they expoit it, and how they resist actual remedies. Instead, they declare \u201cPro-life, pro-life\u201d where there is no pro-life among them. All in hopes of drowning the biblical voice crying out in the wilderness, \u201cMake straight the ways of the Lord to heal abortion and cure its causes.\u201d  \n\nLike most people, I detest abortion. I want to see it become a non-issue in our society. I want to see it remedied by real people who really care, who are willing to apply the difficult, but real solutions that work. I\u2019m tired of people who are more interested in politics than life.\n\nThat\u2019s why I can\u2019t vote for Trump, the Bible tells me so.",
         "Funny thing, there actually IS a part of the Bible that talks about abortion - and the only mention of it is how to properly perform it as a test of the woman's \"faithfulness\" to her husband (Numbers 5: 11-31 if you're curious).",

         "Or, how about unrepentant sin.\n\nMost everyone agrees that sin is bad. Even Trump supporters acknowledge that he is an overly sinful man. All of the Seven Deadly Sins listed in the Bible, Trump blatantly exudes\u2013no question about that. In fact, for some Trump supporters, they love his rebellious spirit, even against God. Yet, right in the face of the Bible, Christians who support Trump wave their many flags of excuses such as, \u201cEveryone sins,\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re not electing a pastor\u201d or, \u201cLook at David in the Bible, he sinned, but God used him.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, those statements are true. However, in Scripture, there is a huge, defining difference. God never raised up anyone for leadership who didn\u2019t first repent of their sins. Not one, period. Scripturally, repentance has always been a precursor for being lifted up by God.\n\nYet, without any pause in their biblical steps, for many Christians who support Trump, they believe God anointed Him for leadership and to do His will in America and beyond. However, given the fact that Trump has never repented of his sins, even when given the chance, this is a biblical impossibility. In fact, in many conservative Evangelical churches, Trump couldn\u2019t even qualify to become their janitor without a repentance of sins, but somehow he can become their God-appointed President?\n\nStill to this day, Trump refuses to repent. How do I know? The \u201cfruits of repentance\u201d that John the Baptist insisted upon in Scripture are nowhere to be found in Trump. \n\n\u201cBut when John saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his place of baptism, he said to them, \u2018You brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the coming wrath? Produce fruit, then, in keeping with repentance.\u2019\u201d Mathew 3:7-8\n\nTrump is undeniably the same lying, profane, greedy, mocking, bullying, divisive, jealous, arrogant, narcissistic, and hateful man he was at the beginning of his presidency. That\u2019s not a judgement, it\u2019s an inescapable observation. Despite the lipstick Evangelicals want to put on this pig, God is not interested in Trump\u2019s appearances of meeting with Evangelicals, closing his eyes during prayers, randomly using Christian jargon, or waving a Bible around. Instead, He is interested in a humble, genuinely contrite heart. Sadly, a heart Trump neither has nor apparently desires.\n\nAs Jesus warned in Scripture, no unrepented, sin-ladened Trump-like tree can \u201cproduce good fruit.\u201d \n\nI want divine goodness for America. I want integrity and decency in our leadership. I want humble, teachable, kind people at the helm who show strength through maturity and stability.\n\nThat\u2019s why I can\u2019t vote for Trump, the Bible tells me so.\n\nBut, what about the lies?\n\nYes, 20,000 documented lies or misleading statements since Trump was elected. Certainly, by now, he must be giving the Father of Lies a run for his money. With this blatant stronghold of deceit and lying manifested in Trump\u2019s life and leadership, to willfully follow him, vote for him, or give him loyalty is to pledge yourself to evil, is it not? How can it be anything different?\n\n\u201cNo one who practices deceit shall dwell in my house; no one who utters lies shall continue before my eyes.\u201d Psalm 101:7\n\n\u201cEloquent lips are unsuited to a godless fool\u2014how much worse lying lips to a ruler!\u201d Proverbs 17:7\n\n\u201cLying lips are an abomination to the Lord\u201d Proverbs 12:22\n\nMost Christian Trump supporters insist that the LGBTQ community is biblically declared an \u201cabomination\u201d to the Lord and should never be supported, followed, or given influence in our society. Yet, these same Christians joyfully give a man, who the Bible declares as a lying \u201cabomination,\u201d their praise, worship, and anointing as a healthy, worthy, divine leader. How can this possibly be? For it\u2019s certainly not biblical.\n\n\u201cLet me describe for you a worthless and a wicked man; first, he is a constant liar; he signals his true intentions to his friends with eyes and feet and fingers. He is always thinking up new schemes to swindle people. He stirs up trouble everywhere. But he will be destroyed suddenly, broken beyond hope of healing.\u201d Proverbs 6:12-16\n\nMost recently, Trump was caught lying to the American people about the severity of the  Covid-19 virus. Once again, declaring \u201cPeace, peace\u201d where there is no peace. In fact, long after he knew about the lethal severity of the virus he labeled it a \u201choax.\u201d Trump lied, 200,000 people have died. \n\nThe Bible clearly teaches, nothing of God ever comes from lying. \n\nI want a truthful President. I want leadership that places honesty over personal gain. I want to be led by people who believe that \u201cthe truth shall set you free,\u201d even if that truth is unpopular, difficult, or alarming. I want the Father of Lies not to be an object of political aspiration, but the subject of human and societal rejection. \n\nThat\u2019s why I can\u2019t vote for Trump, the Bible tells me so.",

         "Enter, the immigrant, refugee, and the foreigner.\n\nNo one wants illegal immigration or open borders as a national policy, regardless of how conservative Evangelical Trump supporters label the position of progressives. Once again, Trump supporters seem to relish in creating issues that aren\u2019t real to deflect from addressing the ones that are.\n\nIf America is a Christian nation, what happens when immigration (illegal or not) happens? How, biblically, are we to treat the foreigners and immigrants among us, no matter how they arrive? What happens with refugees who come to our border? And, how are we to biblically treat those who seek asylum and new life within our country?\n\nThe Bible has crystal clear answers.\n\n\u201cDo not mistreat or oppress a foreigner, for you were foreigners in Egypt.\u201d Exodus 22:21\n\n\u201cWhen the alien resides with you in your land, you shall not oppress the alien. The alien who resides with you shall be to you as a citizen among you; you shall love the alien as yourself, for you were aliens in the land of Egypt:  I am the Lord your God.\u201d Leviticus 19:33-34\n\n\u201cWhen you reap the harvest of your land, do not reap to the very edges of your field or gather the gleanings of your harvest. Do not go over your vineyard a second time or pick up the grapes that have fallen. Leave them for the poor and the foreigner.\u201d Leviticus 19:9-10\n\n\u201cAs for the foreigner who does not belong to your people Israel but has come from a distant land because of your name\u2014 for they will hear of your great name and your mighty hand and your outstretched arm\u2014when they come and pray toward this temple, then hear from heaven, your dwelling place. Do whatever the foreigner asks of you, so that all the peoples of the earth may know your name and fear you, as do your own people Israel, and may know that this house I have built bears your Name.\u201d (1 Kings 8:41-44)\n\n\u201cThen I will draw near to you for judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers and against the adulterers and against those who swear falsely, and against those who oppress the wage earner in his wages, the widow and the orphan, and those who turn aside the alien and do not fear Me,\u201d says the Lord of hosts.\u201d Malachi 3:5\n\n\u201cFor the Lord your God\u2026loves the strangers, providing them food and clothing.  You shall also love the stranger, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt.\u201d Deuteronomy 10:18-19\n\n\u201cThe Lord watches over the strangers\u2026\u201d Psalm 146\n\n\u201cThe aliens shall be to you as citizens, and shall also be allotted an inheritance.\u201d Ezekiel 47:21\n\n\u201c\u2026I was a stranger and you welcomed me.\u201d Matthew 25:31 (Jesus speaking)\n\nNotice, Jesus doesn\u2019t say they, \u201ccaged me,\u201d \u201cabused me,\u201d \u201cneutered me,\u201d \u201cseparated me from family,\u201d \u201cstarved me,\u201d \u201cmade immigration nearly impossible for me,\u201d \u201cmocked me,\u201d \u201cslandered me,\u201d or \u201cmurdered me.\u201d  \n\nNo, he said of His true followers, they \u201cwelcomed\u201d me. \n\nSadly, this is not the policy of president Trump, nor the Republicans, nor the desires of many of his Christian supporters, even the ones who claim their faithfulness to the Bible and its infallible inerrancy. What God admonishes, they resist.  \n\nFor if you take the Scriptures seriously, the immigrant, the refugee, and the foreigner should not just be \u201cwelcomed\u201d with sacrificial hospitality, but \u201cwanted\u201d as God\u2019s own favored blessing. They should be lifted high among all others. They should be loved, protected, and provide for with the same passion we love, protect, and provide for ourselves. They are not to be objects of resentment, oppression, rejection, exploitation, or inconvenience. Rather, they should be honored as angels sent from above. They are us, and we are them. For in Christ, \u201cthere is neither Jew nor Gentile.\u201d\n\nI want a country in sync with God\u2019s heart for the immigrant, the foreigner, the alien, and refugee. I want a country in step with God\u2019s biblical, unconditional \u201cwelcome,\u201d \u201cwant,\u201d and generous care for those outside of our borders who desire to come, live, and find new life within us.  \n\nThat\u2019s why I can\u2019t vote for Trump, the Bible tells me so.",
         "But perhaps, most of all, loving your neighbor as yourself.\n\n\u201c\u2018Love your neighbor as yourself.\u2019 There is no commandment greater than these.\u201d Matthew 12:31\n\n\u201cBut I say, love your enemies! Pray for those who persecute you!\u201d Matthew 5:44\n\nThere is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear, because fear has to do with punishment. The one who fears is not made perfect in love. 1 John 4:18\n\nAs a former white, conservative Evangelical pastor of 20 years, I know deeply how the system works. I\u2019m not trying to slam the faith or the people within it, but the unbiblical evils must be chased out of the shadows, especially the hate of love among so many.\n\nFor most everything within white, conservative Evangelicalism isn\u2019t focused on having a neighbor to love, but rather based upon having an enemy that must be hated. Fear of these enemies is the ultimate motivator, not love. They will create it, fabricate it, and inflame it. For they are nothing without fear and the hate it awakens\u2026\n\nIf we love minorities as ourselves, they\u2019ll take over the church and society, and we\u2019ll lose our white church, white way of life, and white power. \n\nIf we love black people as ourselves with true equality, true police accountability, true legal fairness, true economic justice, and true opportunity, we\u2019ll have to admit our racism and white privilege, lose our white way of life, and surrender our white power.\n\nIf we love our wives as ourselves and remove the requirement that they must submit to us unquestionably, they\u2019ll take over the family, usurp male power, and run the church and society into the ground.\n\nIf we love the LGBTQ community as ourselves, our patriarchal power will be dismantled, God will punish our life, and all of white, male-driven, conservative Christianity will be flushed down the drain.\n\nIf we love special needs people as ourselves, we\u2019ll have to make an honored and equal place for them in society, overpowering our \u201cnormal\u201d lives with inconvenience. \n\nIf we love the least-of-these as ourselves with economic equality, free health care, free college, a living wage, social security, long-term care, and the removal of poverty, we won\u2019t be able to fund our industrial military complex and foster our diabolical economic system of socialism for top and capitalism for the bottom.  \n\nIf we love the environment as ourselves with significant building and development restrictions, environmental controls, and clean energy standards and investments, we won\u2019t be able to feed our insatiable appetites for economic and personal greed. \n\n\u201cDepart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink, I was a stranger and you did not invite me in, I needed clothes and you did not clothe me, I was sick and in prison and you did not look after me.\u2019 They also will answer, \u2018Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison, and did not help you?\u2019 He will reply, \u2018I tell you the truth, whatever you did not do for one of the least among you, you did not do for me.\u2019\u201d -Matthew 25:41-45\n\n\u201cHe who oppresses the poor to increase his wealth and he who gives gifts to the rich\u2013both come to poverty.\u201d -Proverbs 22:16\n\n\u201cNow this was the sin of your sister Sodom: She and her daughters were arrogant, overfed and unconcerned; they did not help the poor and needy.\u201d -Ezekiel 16:49\n\n\u201cThere is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.\u201d Galatians 3:28\n\n\u201cIf you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, \u201cLove your neighbor as yourself,\u201d you are doing right. But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers.\u201d James 2:8-9",
         "See, where God admonishes that our highest motivation should be the unconditional love and care for all of humanity equally, in contrast, there is truly no other fuel that drives the Evangelical Death Star than having enemies to fear, hate, marginalize, fight, and treat unequally.\n\nThis is why Trump has the addictive support and allegiance of most conservative Evangelicals. For the only thing they understand is fear, and Trump speaks their language like no other. He mocks special needs people, bullies his perceived enemies, embraces racism, fosters white supremacy, mistreats women, ignites division, worships greed, and loves himself above all things.\n\nBiblically, this is the ultimate blaspheme of the Spirit.\n\nTo see love as the enemy.\n\nTo see fear as the friend.\n\nTo see enemies as the goal.\n\nTo fight at all cost, with lies, violence, duplicity, and sin.\n\nTo see a white, conservative, Republican, American Jesus as the way, truth, and life.\n\nTo see white, conservative Evangelicalism as the Kingdom.\n\nI want a President with whom love is greater than fear. I want a country where to love all people equally is a friend and not an enemy. I want the character of a great person, a great society, a great economy, and a great nation to be defined by their love for all people equally, not fear nor hate. \n\nThat\u2019s why I can\u2019t vote for Trump, the Bible tells me so. \n\nGrace is brave.

Republicans try to push VBM hard in order to lock in votes in case Trump gets caught ~~sucking off a microphone hosting a nazi rally getting caught unable to open a garbage truck's door dancing for 39 minutes straight like a dementia patient insulting women, latinos, etc~~ doing something that would lose him votes. \n\nA 400k vote firewall in an environment like that is pretty good...

But I started getting second thoughts about it recently. \n\nI am not a Democrat or a Republican. I disagree with the Democrats (and Reddit) on a lot of issues. But this morning, I was thinking about the Supreme Court. I thought about Trump's actions following the 2020 election, and how the Supreme Court recently gave him immunity for what he did. I realized how much I despise the current Supreme Court for that and so many other things. It's more than just policy. I believe that this Supreme Court is flat out corrupt and I didn't want to reward them. \n\nI won't lie. I'm worried. I don't like the Biden-Harris economy and I want the 2019 economy back. But the economy has been getting a bit better lately, and I really don't like the current Supreme Court. Voting for Harris felt like voting against them. So that's what I did.\n\n**Edit:** Thanks for all the comments. I would like to note, I am well aware that Trump inherited a great situation from Obama and that Biden inherited a pandemic. What really frustrated me was how long the recovery took. I know it was a once in a lifetime event, but I thought we'd get over it faster than this. I could elaborate more on my exact thought process, but what matters is that I eventually decided to trust Harris to get us to where we need to be. \n\n",

And if he does that, Trump will have picked FIVE (5!!!) Supreme Court judges of the 9 member group. So literally over half of them. They're already given him immunity--imagine what else they would do for him and his autocratic, power-hungry allies with even more support.\n\nThat shit is absolutely terrifying--that honestly for me is one of the scariest parts of his candidacy.\n\nReally... thank you so much for seeing and understanding that it's not just about the one Presidential candidate themselves... it's about what they would do with their leadership that would affect the rest of the country.",

The most impactful economic policy is really decided by the non-partisan Fed board rates, or by other factors like the pandemic or migration in the case of home prices. It also can take a couple years for legislative policy to take effect (meaning the 2017-2019 economy was sort of set up by Obama's policies). Trump's biggest proposed policy, tariffs, would be a tax increase on everybody and a massive price increase throughout the supply chain, bad enough that it could lead to recession and would make the 2021-22 inflation look quaint.",

It's dampened by the aforementioned 'consequences of no economic growth'.\n\nReal strength is outwards and involves investing in people and their livelihoods; economically and emotionally.

They can raise or lower the national debt, which will affect the value of our currency. They can crack down on price gouging, or allow it. They can regulate Wall Street to allow or prevent actions that create instability in the market. And all those things only affect the economy years down the line. \n\nThe Fed, which is independent, can raise or lower interest rates. That usually has pretty immediate effects.\n\nThe president only has one thing he or she can do by themselves, and that is raise or lower tariffs.

         "The crazy thing about the economic recovery from covid is that the resulting inflation was a global issue, and we've actually bounced back faster from it than most other countries. The price issues you're seeing, especially at the grocery store, are now mostly the result of corporate greed. They know everyone needs food and we were willing to pay the high prices back when inflation was high, because we don't have a choice. We're still going to be shopping at grocery stores, and the cuts we'll have to make in order to be able to afford to eat will have to come from somewhere else. You're already seeing fast food prices start to drop again because a lot of people just cut that out entirely once it got too expensive. But groceries? They can screw us sideways and we'll still have to shop there. They used inflation as a convenient excuse to keep prices high, and people still think we have massive inflation as a result. Call me a socialist, but if a business is involved in selling something that is necessary for continued existence, the government should be able to step in and limit price-gouging. \n\nAlso, anyone concerned about the price of eggs in specific should know that there's a massive H5 bird flu outbreak. Started in wild birds, spread to poultry farms, and now the poultry farm workers are coming down with it. Not good. I shopped for eggs this weekend. It had been about a month since I'd bought some and the prices had gone from $4 a dozen to $6. I about lost my mind until I realized that there are a lot more factors at play than just corporate greed on that one.

It's crazy how big the list of reasons to dislike Trump is, so that \"abysmally mismanaged a major global crisis\" isn't one of the first things that comes to mind for most people! A real leader could have saved many lives instead of creating so much confusion.",
         "Nurse during Covid pandemic here: omg I agree! He mismanaged this one by ignoring the science. His narcissistic personality disorder caused 100\u2019s of thousands of deaths. Had Harris been our president there would be a lot more living people.  We had to reuse masks because the supplies were not there and he did nothing to increase PPE (personal protection equipment) like masks, gowns, etc. I worked in a very wealthy Bay Area hospital system and we were given 1 N95 mask a week. It was pure hell being a nurse at that time and he did absolutely nothing to help solve very solvable problems. He poo-pooed the brilliant life-long scientists who dedicated their lives to infectious diseases. I guess this post shows I\u2019m still traumatized by that experience.",
         "I\u2019ll never forget coming into the country from Japan in February 2021 after the supposed \u201cChina Ban\u201d took effect on a plane with lots of Chinese nationals who I figured would have a tough time clearing LAX immigration and customs. Most of them exited before me and none of us so much as had our temperature taken unlike SARS a decade before. \n3 weeks later I had to cut back my vacation home because Japan was about to close down and my wife and kids (and job) needed me. But not before the shit show of ages spun up over here where just getting water and toilet paper involved heated negotiations with other shoppers. \n\nAnd that was just the beginning to an awful almost 2 years of that shitty timeline for me. I wish I could simulate me voting against the muthaphuka every 4 hours for the dopamine hit I felt in the voting booth 2 weeks ago.",

Thank you for what you did, thank you for what you do, and thank you for what you\u2019re doing to help our future.",
         "And also with project 2025 OSHA could be in trouble.  OSHA kept me protected when I was able to cite a statute of why I had to be properly fitted for an n95 to see Covid patients instead of whatever was available.  OSHA keeps a lot of workers protected from unscrupulous bosses.",

         "The people who demanded their freedom not to take precautions during the pandemic have not stepped up to take responsibility for causing the COVID-19 mortality rate in the USA to be *four times* the international average.\n\nI have no doubt that those same people will claim, \"We didn't know\" if the orange felon manages to consolidate absolute power.\n\nThey know; they just don't *care.*",

         "People dooming about Florida don't realize that Harris didn't campaign here at all. Sure it would have been nice for her to do better here, but it definitely was a tactical decision to not spend any time or money on Florida. It would have just been repating the same mistakes of Hillary in 2016.\n\nWould you all rather have her spend so much time and money here instead of Michigan and Pennsylvania? So she could just lose to Trump here by a few less points? Florida isn't a swing state anymore, its best to just swallow that bitter pill and move on. It's what the GOP did after 2012 when Mitt Romney spent so much time and money thinking Colorado and Virginia were still swing states, they moved on in 2016 and didn't chase unicorns. Florida is just a money pit for the Democratic party, even as a Floridian I'm glad Kamala spent almost nada here, so she didn't take other states for granted.",

The biggest one is that the voting machines used in my State are just fancy counting machines, and after the polls close and the last ballot is cast, I grab two other volunteers, they witness me break the seal on the password to transmit the scanned count, and they continue to witness me go through the process to transmit the count to the division of elections electronically. That's 95% or more of the votes for that precinct being submitted at once. That's happening across all precincts in the state, since we're all one time zone. \n\nThe other big jump is that absentee and mail-in ballots are scanned into the same type of machine and therefore submitted electronically after the scanning is complete. Depending on the state and how they handle these ballots, it could be one location with one machine, one location with multiple machines, or multiple locations with multiple machines. Each of these machines that transmits causes a sudden \"nearly instant\" change in vote count, and certain precincts are going to be significantly more red or blue, and absentee ballots tend to lean one way as well. \n\nDon't look at jumps in vote counts and say someone cheated - it just makes you look silly.",
