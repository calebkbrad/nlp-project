      "title": "I have terminal cancer and I voted for my last Presidential election for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz",
      "text": "On August 1, 2022, I was diagnosed with Stage IV Ovarian cancer\n\nI was told that is was incurable but treatable until it was no longer treatable \n\nThe average life span for a woman with advanced Ovarian Cancer is 3 years.  \nI will reach that date next August.  \n\nI get chemotherapy every week but eventually I will run out of treatment options.\n\nCancer has changed me.  It has made me an optimist,  and more compassionate.\n\nI never expected to survive long enough to see a woman, and a democrat of black and Asian descent reach the highest pinnacle in our land\n\nMaybe a little extra special because my father immigrated to this country from India.  Married my mother, herself a child of immigrants from Norway \n\nWe are the embodiment of the American dream, and it was my honor and privilege to cast my ballot for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz.\n\nTim Walz seems like a great dad.  I should know about great dads.  Mine is still going strong at 88.  \n\nMy parents were happily married for over 60 years until my mother passed in 2021\n\nI see in Kamala a women who is strong and fierce when she needs to be but that strength is tempered by kindness and strong family values (real family values not that fake pageantry you see put on for the benefit of the cameras)\n\nTomorrow, we make history and hopefully begin the long journey towards healing as a country.\n\nAnd recognize that together we are strong, divided we will fall\n\nI await the hour when we can honestly call her \u201cPresident Elect Kamala Harris\u201d\n\nNow, what are you waiting for?  VOTE!!!\n\nEdit:  Thank you so much for your kind words.  I wanted to share my story because I knew you would understand how special tomorrow will be to countless others.  Some terminally or chronically ill, others taking a step across the aisle and a leap of faith and most of all new voters and young voters who we gladly entrust the future to you.  ",

It was their final, most essential command.\n\n-George Orwell, 1984. This can be seen in everything Trump does. But especially in his false allegations of fraud in 2020. \n\nWhich was, quite simply, a blatant lie made to hold on to power. If we look at the facts, the election boards and state legislature of Arizona and Georgia, the two states he pushed hard with the fraud allegations, were Republican. Bill Barr was a Republican and the senior member of his old Administration. Mike Pence was his Vice President. General Mark Milley is a Republican and was his Military Chief of Staff and he's called Trump a fascist. The Federal Elections Commission that worked under Trump found no fraud. Fox News was too damn scared to fight Dominion on election lies so they settled out for almost a billion dollars without a fight. Trump took this lie to Judges, some of which he appointed and others were registered Republican and Independent, and they found no fraud after reviewing legal cases brought forth by the Trump campaign and administration. \n\nThis lie was so big, he tried a coup on January 6 when he exhausted all of his legal options. The fact that so many of his supporters still push this lie today shows that they follow this essential command.",

It is all I can do to keep my mouth shut when my husband's siblings bring up Trump.  This morning my sister-in-law sent a group text that asked if anyone was voting for Kamaltoe.  How incredibly disrespectful and disgusting!! I am so angry that a woman would disrespect a fellow woman with that term, especially a well-educated, strong, and beautiful human being, Kamala Harris. The only term I want to call her is MADAM PRESIDENT!!",
         "Like u/Happy_Cookie8081 said, we just never spoke about it. But with trumps recent comments he started getting concerned and wanted to talk to me about it."

         "That\u2019s fine. As an independent voter I want our government to work together on the issues. You can\u2019t do that with the current GOP, and unfortunately it will take many election cycles to rid Trumps influence.\n\nI am happy that you exercised your right to vote. Let\u2019s get rid of MAGA and get back to working together. We all Americans.",
         "I welcome a normal Republican Party back. I will almost always disagree with it, but I welcome it back and you to vote for it.",
         "I actually really think Trump was the symptom, not the disease.  Look how easily the Republicans capitulated to him over and over again.  Look how easily he won the primary 3 times.  There\u2019s no leadership in the Republican Party and it seems like a huge proportion of the electorate doesn\u2019t understand that fascism is bad.\n\nWe are in a very, very dangerous place and the power vacuum after Trump\u2019s exit is going to be dangerous too.",
         "Dr. Heather Cox Richardson, an American historian, writer and college professor states that American needs at least two healthy political parties to stay a viable democracy. Thank you for voting to help us stay on that path.",
         "Thank you, friend! \n\nIt's my dream that after Trump we can return to more civil times and have far less consequential elections.",
         "Just came to say I respect  this take and also thank you! I was a Republican through the 2016 election. At this point, I\u2019m not sure I can fully go back after what has happened the past 8 years but I\u2019ll certainly be more than happy to cross party lines if one proves to be the better candidate!",
         "I'm a lifelong democrat but please bring back the old GOP - it needs more of the John McCain's. Trump has got to go.",
         "As a progressive, honestly, I really just want a regular Republican party. No more racism or mysogyny or poor loser-ship or culture war BS. I want civil debate. I want this because in a 1 party society we ALL lose. We NEED at least 2 parties, we need civility, we need bipartisan compromise. We need a government that serves us ALL, not themselves. And the way to get that is MORE representation, NOT less.",

         "This is how I'd feel if the election were between Trump and Mitt Romney. I didn't vote for him when he ran in 2012, and disagree with him on nearly 100% of policy issues, but he's not a pathological liar, not a rapist or racist, respects the Constitution and rule of law (as evidenced by his willingness to vote to convict Trump on impeachment). I'd be happy to vote for Mitt Romney to save the country from Trump.",

         "Welcome to the resistance",
         "I don't think most Dems ask for anything more but I sincerely thank you for seeing how dangerous he is and how frankly unconservative that Trump and his MAGA cult are. Even though I am a liberal, I want to have conservatives in Congress that will work to pass legislation to help improve the country because there are some huge issues we are facing both internationally and domestically. And the yoyoing from extremes does not lead to good governance. Nor does a party of performative actors that their main focus is on getting clicks by lying and dividing.",
         "I agree! Ive voted red and blue for years, from local elections to presidential as I believe both sides have great ideas. And it\u2019s voters like you who are preserving our ability to have a nation with sane discussions regarding differences and progress to a sustainable and enjoyable future.",
         "I love having political conversations with Republicans. \n\nI can not stand having political conversations with Trump Supporters. \n\nAs a follower of the Democratic party, I would love for Republicans to find their morals and decency once again (more parties, the better!). Thank you for voting country over party. The faster we stop Trump, the faster we can heal as a nation. \n\n\ud83e\udef1\ud83c\udffb\u200d\ud83e\udef2\ud83c\udffc",

         "I can't wait to get back to arguing with you once we're past this hurdle, patriotic adversary!",
         "I think a ton of us who tend to vote dem totally understand that these are special circumstances and fully expect that crossover voters won\u2019t change their fundamental point of view in the long run. Our politicians need to be accountable to the people of this country, and I think part of that is having an opposition party to push back on your BS \u2014 and no party or individual has zero BS. \n\nSomebody who crosses the aisle to support the constitution and the rule of law deserves respect, IMO.",
         "Thank you!",
         "Right there with you friend. I protest-voted third party in every presidential election since 2008. This year I'm voting Harris, zero hesitation. Trump can not be President again.",
         "I\u2019m a big fan of NATO, EU, Ukraine, and all our allies. Thank you for crossing over for this election \ud83d\udc99 I hope you voted some down ballot blue as well. I\u2019m tired of \u2018republicans\u2019 falling in line behind Trump. If they stood up, after 1/6 etc, we wouldn\u2019t be here.\n\nIf it\u2019s any comfort, Kamala is more a centrist than anything. Let\u2019s shift that Overton Window to the center again.",
         "I\u2019m a progressive liberal and i long for the day we have a normal Republican Party again! Thank you for putting country over party!",
         "As a super libby lib, please bring your party back with some tact and respect. Differing opinions and discourse are needed. For now, thank you so much for seeing him for who he is.",
         "Well, you might have to vote Kamala again in four years when Trump and Vance run again!",
         "I actually hope the Republican Party does get its sanity back, and can provide an actual worthy candidate in four years. \u00a0There is room for all in the marketplace of ideas.\n\nThat said, Trump is a cancer that needs to be excised first. \u00a0He is a miserable human being who puts himself above our nation and tried to figuratively wipe his ass with the Constitution.\u00a0",
         "I saw a quote from a Harris voter that said \u201cIf Kamala is bad, we can vote her out in 4 years. If Trump is bad, we may not be able to vote in 4 years.\u201d",
         "\"I disagree strongly with Kamala Harris on all issues.\" And this is why the Republican party will dead after trump. People like you who disagree with equality and compassion and progress are outnumbered and dying out. Trump is just the final nail on the coffin.",
         "Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!\n\nThis from a Democrat way on the left to a Republican who agrees with none of her policies. The times we live in. You give me hope that democracy will be the winner. Thank you again.",
         "I left the Republican Party back in 2002 as a result of Bush lying about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. \n\nSo many of my friends went to war to come back with PTSD",
         "One party rule over the long term is not good and leads to corruption. We need to recover the tradition of the loyal opposition. Thank you for doing your part.",
         "No intelligent person expects a fundimentally conservative person to turn liberal this election period.\n\nTechnically you voted Democrat, but IMHO that's not what you really did.  You voted anti-Trump.   \n\nAnd you know what?  That is more than we can ask a Republican to do.  So thank you.   Thank you for trying to get the Republican party back where American needs it to be.\nI do genuinely think America needs to be aware of, and have the ability to choose different but viable directions for their future.   I don't know if that will ever happen in this age of slander/fear mongering, sadly.",
         ">It's not happening again so don't get excited. \n\nI don't understand this mindset. Vote for whichever party will make the country better, regardless of who they are. You don't have to make a party your identity.",
         "So, bottom line, Harris is infinitely more likely to respect the will of the people and respond to public pressure. Even if you disagree with her, you STILL have a better chance of getting policies you do care about enacted with someone who will at least listen. You're 100% right, keeping our republic is more important than a political party\u00a0",
         "Hey, you\u2019re on board for democracy! We\u2019ll take it! Then we can go back to working our issues out through the political process. We all kind of hate it, but it\u2019s better than all the alternatives!",
         "Respect. The enemy of my enemy is my friend.",
         "I think this country is better with two functioning parties. \nRight now the Republicans are dysfunctional, and it is not clear how many election cycles it will take for you to be functional again.   \n\nI disagree on most of republican policy, but can at least entertain debate if you are not fascist, racist, etc",
         "The Grand Old Party needs to make a come back. Get rid of MAGA",
         "I've voted conservative on some things but for God's sake trump is clownshoes. I consider myself an independent on the political spectrum. Trump is a fucking fool",
         "I respect you",
         "For the sake of our country, I do hope your Republican Party comes back. However, I\u2019m not so sure that will happen in the next 4 years. If (When) Trump loses, he\u2019s not going away. Trumpism is not going away. He\u2019s turned the base against all the traditional, old school republicans. \n\nThe cult/base is riled up. They won\u2019t settle for a boring normal conservative\u2014one would never make it through the primaries. A sleeping giant has been awakened.",
         "Sorry, your party\u2019s going to take a few decades to recover. In the meantime, we Democrats are open to compromise in an effort to make our country stronger. \n\nYour party has proven to be full of cowards who cannot be trusted. It\u2019ll take a while to rebuild. Anyway, I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve seen the light and hope you\u2019ll continue to keep your options open as we heal.",
         "You obviously don't \"disagree strongly...on all issues\".\n\nUnless, of course, you *strongly* disrespect the constitution and election results.",
         "Welcome aboard! Country over party, always!",
         "It will be great to someday have a principled, non cynical and viable Conservative Party again. \n\nBut if I had to guess, it won\u2019t be the Republican Party, which seems to have gone too far down the populist-idiocratic rabbit hole.",
         "Welcome. And thank you for doing the right thing for the country. I imagine it was probably hard.\n\nI know if Trump was running against Mitt Romney or George Bush or Liz Cheney, I would have a very, very hard time voting. But at the end of the day, we can only solve big issues through a robust democracy, so that must be prioritized above all else. I would grit my teeth, but I'd vote for anyone over trump, even if I disagreed with them on many fundamentals.",
         "Thank you\ud83d\udc99+\u2764\ufe0f",
         "Harris may surprise you, I think she will for a lot of people. We shall see.\n\nBut thank you. As a non conservative, I also agree we need a non fascist conservative party to bring more people to the table and help our democracy.",
         "OP \u2013 can you share any insight as to why more Republicans don\u2019t have this view regarding the 2020 election??\n\nI don\u2019t understand how it\u2019s not seen as disqualifying by everyone.",
         "I do miss the days of respectful politics from both Republicans and Democrats. Once Trump, his ideals, and followers are free from it, I think (slowly) it will become back to normal.",
         "Thank you for being a part of the solution! Much respect. We need to return to a state of normalcy and heal as a country. It won\u2019t happen overnight, but Harris being in office and maybe appointing a Republican to be in her cabinet will gradually make things better.",
         "Whenever a Republican puts country before party, an angel gets its wings. And I quote Victor Lazlo from \u201cCasablanca\u201d: \u201cWelcome back to the fight. This time I know our side will win.\u201d \n\nAnd I say, Thank you. With hot tears of hope streaming down my face.",
         "I respect and admire you so much.  Thank you for putting your country first.",
         "I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s not happening again until you know if next time they put up just as bad of a maga candidate. \nWe need more parties but Maga is a no go",
         "Vote party, candidate or issue..   as long as yu vote",
         "Trump has destroyed the Republican party.\n\nLife long Republicans like the Cheney family, along with SO many of Trumps past Cabinet and security - military past employees came out with warnings about Trump lust for power said enough for me.\n\nAdd in January 6th with Trump claiming he would walk with the rioters to the Capitol but went back to his warm White House office to watch on TV while 6 people died due to Trumps mouth",
         "I respect your vote even if I likely disagree with you on most or all issues.\n\nI don't respect people that vote for Trump.",
         "THANK YOU. It's time to purge the scourge for sure. I miss healthy debate with people who know how to shake hands and be diplomatic grownups. When I see people like the Cheneys doing as you're doing, it gives me hope that we can get back to more civil times. I'm a liberal Democrat, and my uncle was a conservative Republican. We could have lively conversations without it getting ugly. The country needs to do that too. Who else misses hearing stuff like the \"youth and inexperience\" Reagan/Mondale exchange, followed by a friendly handshake and gracious respect? I sure do. \ud83d\ude09",
         "Same. Fuck Donald Trump",
         "Thank you for putting country over party and hey, you might like what you see on the blue side. I enjoyed my brief time with my university's college Republicans prior to 2016, but it will probably be a long time before I ever consider voting Republican. The Republican party seriously needs to purge itself. Not only of Trump, but also politicians who are still loyal to his movement. And there are many.",
         "True democracy can still have differing views - that's how life goes, and I think most sane people understand this. But this election isn't about differing views, it's about a crazy, truly dangerous human with plans to destroy the fundamentals of democracy, and the other person. There really is no choice - I absolutely respect you and everyone else who knows that making a compromise like this in the short term means we all get freedom of choice - and elections to exercise that freedom - in the future.",
         "I think many Republicans feel the same - they are not so much pro-Harris as they are Anti-Trump.  I hope we have future elections where we differ on mere policy issues.",
         "If there was a Democrat who was a dangerous populist demagogue (even without all the other terrible stuff about Donald Trump) I would vote for a sane Republican no matter how much I disagreed with their policies. And I have never voted for a Republican for anything! \n\nIn a way I feel like this whole MAGA nightmare has made me feel far more respect for Republicans who have decided against Trump. I admire Liz Cheney so much, even though I probably don\u2019t agree with her on a single policy issue. \n\nThank you for sharing!",
         ">But my Republican party will be back\n\nWho do you think put Trump where he is now? Sorry, not sorry but, if you want a candidate that isn't stupid then start with educating yourself. Kamala's policies are moderate, if you disagree with her on every issue then it sounds like you just want a smarter Trump.",
         "Thank you for putting country over party you know what we can debate policy and I look forward to that honestly I do but we cannot do that if we don\u2019t have our country so thank you so much",
         "You fail to realize that we as democrats don\u2019t view this as a popularity contest. We are not doggedly voting democrat for the sake of it. We\u2019re voting democrat because the Republican party is ass backwards right now.\n\nWould I ever vote for a Republican? Absolutely. One day I would if I feel their polices will be better for the country and the people in it than their democratic counterpart. \n\nThe biggest mistake the Trumpers make is assuming we are like them and have a cult like adoration for Harris. We do not.",

         "It's not even the Republican party right now, its the MAGA party. My grandma who has always voted Republican can't even bring herself to vote for them this year. Any normal conservative is voting democrat this year till the cultist are removed.",

         "Why do I get the feeling that you are harping on the democrats being much worse at one point when the truth is that the ideals of the two parties flipped at one point?\n\nOh. \n\nRight. \n\nBecause\u2026.this is a common Republican talking point. So which is it\u2026..? Are you too ignorant to understand history or are you simply just a liar who understands history but still wants a way to say that Dems are horrible?

         "Welcome, even if it's just for this election. \n\nYou've shown a significantly higher maturity level than many others by being able to put aside party and vote for not the next 4 years, but for the next 40. Because that's how long it'll take to dig our way out of a second trump term with all the damage he's planning on doing. \n\nNeighbors don't have to always agree.

And the majority of Republican politicians and voters will support that despotism.  \n\nI'm really happy you've figured out trump is horrible.  The country needs you to entertain the idea that, going forward, it's no longer about right vs left or even about policy that directly affects your life.  It's about freedom and democracy vs despotism.  And I know that might sound crazy but we live in a world where an insane billionaire who is extremely hostile to democracy just built himself an AI robot army.  We live in crazy times.

         "The cravenness of the Republican \u201cleadership\u201d since Trump was elected has been stunning. I\u2019m not a young person, technically Independent, definitely not a Dem activist, but I\u2019ve probably have ended up supporting Dem candidates most all of the time due to being much more aligned on the major issues. Still, in years past, I would usually give Republican candidates a look, particularly in statewide races. TBH, I even seriously considered voting for Trump in \u201816, not really on the issues then, but I struggled with the idea that after McConnell and the rest gave Obama such a hard time, they were SO obstructionist, I feared that the Clinton \u201cbaggage\u201d would just stall the country in any kind of signifiant legislative progress for another 4 years. There were probably even a whole day or two where I might have said I was gonna vote for Trump, some weeks before the election. I\u2019d been angry at him when he first came to prominence with his birther bullshit, I never appreciated his schtick, but I imagined holding my nose and voting for him hoping the country could move forward. Still, by a month or so before the election I\u2019d heard enough from him that I quickly changed my mind. I saw how flawed his character is, how ignorant the man was yet still aspired to the highest office. So, I couldn\u2019t bring myself to do it and I was WAY more comfortable voting for Hillary. This is a long way to say that I\u2019m not a knee-jerk partisan. So, I have been terribly disappointed in how the Republican party allowed this all to happen. The massive hypocrisy and abasement on the part of the likes of Rubio, Cruz, McConnell, McCarthy, etc., the so-called \u201cleadership.\u201d And now we have JD Vance, the worst kind of political opportunist. The worst thing is that these people have allowed our institutions to fail us, they failed to live up to their constitutional responsibility. The founders probably couldn\u2019t imagine serious people in high office being so  utterly irresponsible. The failure of the 2nd impeachment was the nadir of this failure. From Mitt Romney\u2019s telling, it may well be that several Senators that otherwise would have voted to convict, vote for acquittal out of literal fear for their own safety and that of their families. And that was essentially a fear of the same fascist reaction of retribution that hangs over us all today, as we await the results of this election.",

         "The last time the Democrats completely fell apart was the election of 1860. That did not end well. \n\nEarlier the country mostly did okay (apart from breaking treaties and ethnic cleansing Native Americans) in the period when the former Federalists were figuring out how to make a viable Whig alternative to the Democratic-Republicans and the succeeding Jacksonian populist Democrats. \n\nParty realignment is fairly frequent in American politics. One-party government at all levels is much more unusual.",

Not that there aren't racist Democrats; naturally, there are. But as a party platform, racism has been far more of an open thing in the GOP for as long as I've been alive.",

         "No, you didn't say you disagree. But you said \"of course a democracy needs more than one party,\" which is, exactly as you pointed out, literally a requirement and is obvious. You also said it doesn't require academic rigor to know this. Again, you are correct, a 7th grader ~~would~~ should know the definition of a democracy. So from your words it seemed like you missed the key word, \"two *healthy* parties.\" Whether you agree or disagree wasn't the point. I've seen the quote before and it struck me as interesting and apparently true, as evidenced by *motions to current situation.* OP wasn't commenting and quoting a scholar to point out basic knowledge that everyone already knows, and I wasn't saying you agree or disagreed, so stop trying to harsh the mellow on this, our sacred Election Eve \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\udc9e",

         "Idk about that. Obama was incredibly popular and Bush was universally disliked (and the recession started a month or two before the election) so I think people were ready for change (see what I did?). McCain was always a longshot in 2008. He picked Palin because he was losing and needed a gamechanger. Another person considered for his VP pick was Joe Lieberman (a Democrat). I do wonder what would have happened had he done a cross-party ticket.",
         "Thinking about the inverse of the situation we're in is super funny to me.\n\nImagine if there were a Democratic candidate, \"Tom\" and they pick a nut job for VP, \"Hank\", that has some extreme and questionable authoritarian views, but is progressive nonetheless, and was chosen in an effort to gain more support of progressives. This strategy ends up failing and Tom/Hank lose the election. Those that were given a voice now no longer have it and are super pissed, so they go full extreme conspiracy butthurt mode and before you know it, in the next election cycle the country is attempting to elect an actual communist as a Democratic candidate that is very overtly attempting to consolidate power, eliminate rivals, stack loyalists, the whole 9 yards, but the brainwashed that gawk over this commie don't see it. All of us have to then vote Republican to save our country's democracy and free market system and such.\n\nLike, WHAT THE FUCK TIMELINE IS THAT, MAN!? LMAO. It's like some Cold War propaganda movie or something. Wild. Anyways, I thought I'd share this, as I think it puts into perspective just how big of a deal defeating Trump is in our nation's history. This is a very important timeline, and our children/grandchildren will ask to interview us about how it was like living in these times."

Important questions don't discussed enough, and the group makes some big mistakes. But when people come from many different backgrounds, and they discuss their ideas respectfully, you really do learn a lot.\n\nIf we want America to work like that, we need to support people who disagree respectfully, and oppose anyone that tries to tear the country apart.",

And Im not saying that to be a doomer, but if any other uncommitted are lurking, I want you to see this. \n\nHarris really might not be functionally different than Biden if Gaza. That is a devastating reality. But even *if* the US is going to have bad Israel policy no matter who is president, there's still more at stake. Climate change is an existential threat. Abortion bans are going to kill people. \n\nWe don't have to be \"proud\" to vote for Harris, we just need to realize that Trump is the alternative, and one of them is going to win.",

I miss the days when there was nothing to do politically more than have civil policy debates with my friends and neighbors. \n\nWhen did the insane lies invade the conversation? I can't remember when exactly but I feel like it really started with Rush Limbaugh and then expanded with Fox News and then politicians began actually winning elections based on it.\n\nYou can't have a conversation with someone who is starting from a space of denying actual reality, and demonizing people who didn't do the things that they're being accused of. It just...somehow respect and civility got away from us. And I remember that moment with John McCain so clearly.\n\nWe need that back, Conservatives need to demand that from their representatives. Honesty. Integrity. IT MATTERS.\n\nMaybe the problem is that we can't fix any problems when we're fighting with each other based on things that never actually happened...? When the discussion is not in good faith that's not a path to solving anything. If we agree that there are problems that need to be solved, we need to ALSO agree to be honest about the actual issues and what's happening.\n\nThat's what civility, honesty, integrity, respect and decency are for. It's the basis without which nothing can be solved going forward.\n\nHere's to tomorrow representing a return to that vision of ourselves as Americans. It's the one way that I am comfortable in \"going back\", back to the days when we behaved with respect and with an eye towards building a great future for our Nation, not tearing each other down.\n\nAnd OP you're very welcome here, because we may disagree on policy but we agree on what's really important, and I appreciate you for being here today.",

I will be glad when Trump goes away because I feel he has been a horrible and toxic chapter in American political history.\n\nIt's not about this side or that side. I don't have a side. I have fellow Americans and a country.\n\nThank you for understanding and feeling the same.",
         "I want you to know that a lot of us are horrified at what is happening in Palestine, and we really want to get the existential threat to our own country off the table so that we can focus on things like demanding a much more serious repudiation of the US policies that are enabling what is happening there.

So a big chunk of those Republican voters are cannibalized election day voters. \n\nTheir new voter registration was anemic if the early vote is any indication. It may show up on Election Day. But it's quite possible they may learn young men aren't the reliable demographic they thought they were.\n\nWhich is, of course, absolutely no surprise to any parent with a son.",

         "No, they won't do that. Tester, for one, is probably a goner. Republicans need to flip just one seat if Trump wins, and two if Harris wins. It's practically a lock for them, honestly. Best case is likely that we flip the House and win the presidency, and I'll take it.",
         "Lord, I'll just take the presidency, house would be nice though. I'd love to see Mike Johnson out of a job. But you never can tell, these last few days have just felt different, maybe Texas will step up.. you're definitely right about Tester.\u00a0",
         "It will be gridlock for at least two years if all we get is the presidency, and it will suck, but it will still be better than having Trump in the presidency, I'd say. Although Trump in the presidency and a totally Blue congress would hurt his plans as well. Having presidency and House would be OK, no Senate will hurt (especially for judge appointments, etc.), but we are beggars, not choosers, here."

I have voted for both parties, because sometimes I know enough about my party's candidate to know that s/he is either a terrible person, corrupt, or has terrible ideas.  It isn't immoral to vote for the other party's candidate if that candidate is a better person, a more honest person, or has good ideas.  Sometimes you do have to vote one party down-ballot because there is a danger of the other party taking over.  But usually it comes down to what kind of person is running.",

         "Part 3...\n\nAfter I read that book about domestic abuse and realized I HAD to go no contact with this guy who had forcefully weaseled his way into being both my business partner and a sexual partner (despite straight up telling me he intended to move back to NYC with his OTHER girlfriend and have kids with her), I called my friend from Southeast Tech who had gone on the road trip to New Hampshire with me to display \"Out of Lockstep\" a few months earlier absolutely bawling and telling her we HAD to get rid of that guy.\n\nShe also hated him just from the way he acted condescending in zoom chats and was generally annoying, and she had my back with this. But it was also just... something that I didn't want to burden her with. She actually gifted me an emotional support cat after this happened she was so concerned about what was going on.\n\nBut holy shit, the attitudes I have encountered on the right while dealing with this have been completely unacceptable. I've had men tell me that I just \"have a problem with men\" for not wanting to put up with this shit, I've been accused of misandry for getting angry and *having feelings* after being abused, I've been told by right-wingers who hung on my every word in 2021 that I \"talk too much\", I've had people blame me or say that I must be undesirable for this stuff to happen. I've had a man tell me that I was stupid to let my former business partner go and that he should be doing this project instead of me ***(HE'S NOT THE FUCKING ARTIST AND THIS IS LITERALLY ABOUT MY OWN LIFE STORY).*** I've experienced deafening fucking silence from other people. I've had my concerns about ongoing issues with recovery on both a personal and societal level get completely dismissed. I got on Substack because I liked the weird indie journalism there, and both me and my new business partner (who's also a woman) have been harassed by incels constantly on there to the point of needing to go off the platform for weeks at a time. And then when we raise concerns about these incels to other people, we get \"oh, it's just a few fringe crazies, just ignore them.\" Ok but then why are they SO prominent and impossible to ignore?\n\nIn 2021, I trusted right wingers to not be the ones to piss on my head and tell me it's raining, but I'm sorry, the way they act towards women and then tell us we're crazy or it's our fault or we deserve it for not being desirable enough is DEFINITELY pissing on our heads and saying it's raining.\n\nI didn't need that couchfucker JD Vance's comment about \"childless cat ladies\" when I was leaving an abusive relationship and adopting a cat. Did not.\n\nI hate his sentiment towards single women that even when he said things against covid vaccines and lockdowns-- the things I'd been fired up about enough to burn every fucking bridge and move halfway across the country -- I still wanted to kick him in the nuts.\n\nNo. I'm fucking done. For every survivor of rape, sexual assault, domestic abuse, and any other form of misogyny, ***I FUCKING REFUSE TO VOTE TRUMP/VANCE.***\n\nSo done with this shit I'm just going to forgive the Democrats for the lockdowns and mandates instead of voting for those shit heads.",
         "So, part two of this:\n\nI had an issue with another man in that movement abusing me, too.\n\nI originally met him in 2016 in Brooklyn. Him and his girlfriend were polyamorous, and I thought they were just a little eccentric. I was pretty libertine about things and slept with them a few times, but was never interested in any kind of \"serious\" relationship with them or being part of a polycule.\n\nOn New Year's 2020-2021, they happened to be in the area where I was living at the time (Rochester NY) and asked if I wanted to hang out. New York was in its second lockdown at that point, which means that public places I'd been hanging out at during the semi-opened phase were closed down (the goth club, the bar with the fire pit outside, etc). I was only seeing immediate family and my \"pandemic pod\" at that point. My family was so nervous about covid that my brother didn't even come over for Christmas because he worked at the hospital. These two were outside the \"pod\", obviously. But I thought, \"Oh, NYC is so far away, and it's just the three of us, I think it's polite to hang out.\"\n\nAt first we just goofed off, ordering takeout and watching Rocky Horror on TV. But as the night went on, we got drinking, smoking weed, and talking about the lockdowns in more unfiltered ways. I was having severe mental health issues from the isolation and general life disruptions -- to the point where I'd barely survived a bout of alcohol poisoning a few months earlier -- yet I was still explaining to them why I supported the lockdowns. One thing lead to another, and it turned out they had reasons for being opposed, and it was mostly related to mental health stuff, isolation, and substance abuse.\n\nAfter this, the three of use became MUCH closer than we'd ever been in the \"Before Times\". We started doing things like sneaking over the Pennsylvania border together to go to a water resort (there's three things where you can't wear a mask at Kalahari: eating, drinking, and using the water attractions... and there's nothing else to do there... so it became like a speakeasy for anti-maskers). We became extremely close emotionally, and the woman in that couple was creating art pieces inspired by me. It was the most sapphic thing I've ever experienced. She was displaying this stuff in art galleries in Denver once they both moved there from NYC (about a month or two before I moved to South Dakota).\n\nAll through 2021, I was trying to figure out where I could move to since I wanted to die in Rochester NY. Crazy shit happened, and at the end of 2021 I lost my apartment before I could move and I was living out of an industrial building in the shittiest part of the city. I ended up getting infected with covid, and two months later it was ironically the people in No New Normal who pointed out that I sounded like I had \"long covid\" and I should talk to someone from America's Frontline Doctors. It actually worked, but something WEIRD happened. I experienced euphoria while taking ivermectin and struggling to pack my stuff, and that's when I had the idea for \"Out of Lockstep.\"\n\nThe guy in that couple registered the domain name the second I said it over video chat and decided it was now OUR project-- those two were going to be part of it, too.\n\nThey were horribly abusive emotionally through the entire process, and one of them was a raging alcoholic. It was so bad I was going to Al-Anon meetings multiple times a week, and I was not even in the same time zone as them at that point.\n\nWhen I broke up with the guy from reddit who was trying to knock me up, the guy I was working on \"Out of Lockstep\" with at that point saw an opportunity to have a sexual relationship with me.\n\nLong story short, it ended when I read the book \"Why Does He Do That? Inside the Minds of Angry and Controlling Men\" and realized the man I was working with on this project that was so central to my life fit three of the profiles in that book of what abusers are like. I was missing weeks of work at a time because I was so emotionally distraught all the time from the things he was doing to me. It still gets worse...",
         "That was a interesting read. \u00a0I appreciate your journey. \u00a0For what it is worth I think you made the right choice.",
         "Thank you. I've been having a lot of trouble being able to communicate about what's going on and processing everything, so it feels amazing to finally let it out and actually not be attacked. It's restoring my faith in humanity a bit.\n\nIt's worth noting that there are some very good people who are/were involved with the anti-lockdown thing, but there's also been some extremely creepy, wanna-be cult leaders abusing people within that movement.\n\nBecause the entire thing was so suppressed and the people who were in it were marginalized by a lot of their family and friends and had nowhere to turn, there was a power vacuum for people to move in and take advantage of them. Shit like \"Bill Gates is using the vaccine to depopulate the planet and you need to move away from the cities, reproduce, follow the Bible and home school your kids\" sounds a bit \"out there\", but keep in mind, this was being pushed on people who had been practically held in solitary confinement for almost two years at that point and were losing contact with everyone they used to know.\n\nI'm hoping literally anyone who reads this and knows an unvaccinated woman reaches out to her and listens to what she has to say. This isn't just about building a coalition against the most insane MAGA people who want to take away women's rights. This is the larger issue of isolation and echo chambers driving polarization, which is leading to absolute insanity. The best thing women who haven't been through the insane cult-y stuff with \"pure blood\" rhetoric and whatever can do is to talk to the ones who have and let them know they are welcome back into their old circles regardless of their vax status."

That said, the difficulties in running elections in the country's biggest city shed some light. \n\nIt's sometimes really hard to find space to act as a poll site. The most common are local schools but not every community has a school nearby that works as a poll site. They need to be centrally located (to the districts around them), large enough to allow for the expected number of voters, ADA accessible, secure from violence or tampering, and usually hooked up for internet. \n\nFor this reason schools work really well (they tend to check all those boxes) but if you're far from a school, then hopefully there's a VFW, Masonic Temple, Knight of Columbus club house, rec center, or some other \"third space\" that the local Board of Elections can rent for the day.",

There are usually more polling places open on election day, but in many states, the Republicans have made voting difficult by closing locations and forcing long lines. It really varies. But yes, many states work very hard to disenfranchise voters. Ugh.",
         "Keep in mind that in the US, people not just vote for the presidency, but there are multiple (sometimes up to 15-30 I believe) races and choices on their ballot. They vote for their national senator, their house representative for their congressional district, then also for the senate and house of their state, for local candidates in their county, sheriff, education board and sometimes multiple specific law initiatives or measures in some form of referendum. The ballot can be more than one page, and so it can be quite time consuming to fill it out entirely, especially if one is deciding on how to vote up to the moment they are in the voting booth.

      "text": "Hello everybody! I live in Oklahoma. I was raised by conservatives. I followed them blindly in their beliefs, and I liked Trump. I could finally vote in 2020, and I voted for him. I don't really know why. I didn't have any good reasons. I am ashamed.\n\nAnd yet, in the past few years, I did a 180. I am a progressive. I despise what he stands for now. I stand with you all. It's amazing to be behind a ticket that stands for FREEDOM. For love. For caring for one's neighbor. It's amazing to finally have reasons to vote for someone. ACTUAL reasons.\n\nI know my vote will mean little. Oklahoma won't turn blue for the foreseeable future. I'm not even sure if my vote will change anything for the better in the local elections. But that doesn't matter. I WILL be a part of the popular vote. I WILL be on the right side of history. I will NOT bend my knee to a disgraceful, un-American, hateful, wannabee dictator.\n\nI love studying history, and I know a dictator when I see one. I know a fascist when I see one. That is who Trump is. He has no love for disabled people like me. I sure as hell know that he doesn't care about autistic people like me. He doesn't care about women. About minorities. About LGBTQIA+ people. He doesn't care about American workers. He doesn't care about AMERICA.\n\nIf there are ANY undecided voters that see this. Any Oklahomans who aren't going to vote because it seems meaningless, or hopeless. If there any democrats in red states who aren't going to vote because your vote seems meaningless: Think about this for a second. Think about what it means to have the freedom and right to vote. You NEED to be on the right side of history. Voting is how you do it. Voting is how, in many years from now, you can look back and be proud of yourself, that you did not hand our country over to a fascist, and that you made sure that the great American experiment endures.\n\nVote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. Vote for freedom. Vote for AMERICA.",

         "I think most Democrats would agree with you. We\u2019re not trying to get rid of all guns. We just want to make sure gun owners are properly vetted and we want to make it more difficult for guns to be used for crime.",
         "Have you checked ou r/liberalgunowners ?",
         "Parent of a marine. The difference either Kamala or Trump will make to the military is significant. I\u2019m also a 2A supporter although I do believe in \u2018common sense gun control\u2019. I also shoot.",
         ">I do not think we need AR-15s, and think they should be abolished. But if people want a means to hunt (I'm also vegetarian) or protect their homes, I think that's very different than someone having access to an automatic weapon for \"fun\".\n\nAR-15s aren't automatic, though. The military versions are automatic, but civilians aren't allowed to legally own those.\n\nGun friendly conservatives will see what you just wrote here and say \"libs don't know what they're talking about, they have no business talking about trying to abolish our ARs if they don't even know that AR-15s aren't capable of automatic fire.\" \n\nAnd ultimately, abolishing AR-15s wouldn't do anything. There's nothing particularly special about an AR-15 compared to other semi-automatic rifles, at least in terms of schoolchildren murdered per minute. It's just the AR-15 is really well designed and has a giant industry of aftermarket addons because it's so popular. A ban would just result in people buying a Ruger or something. You'd need to ban all semi-automatic weapons entirely.\n\nAt which point shooters just get really good at racking a bolt or using a lever action. An AR-15 can fire faster than a bolt action or lever action, but we're still talking classrooms of dead kids before anyone can respond. \n\nI don't really think it's possible to ban the kind of guns that can easily kill dozens of schoolchildren. The class of guns is too big and there's too many floating around to make it work. Even revolvers with speedloaders and good aim can kill kids distressingly quickly if someone has a mind to.\n\nSo gun control should, IMO, be a matter of keeping any gun out of the hand of crazy people. Background checks, red flag laws, licensing, and ideally some sort of psychiatric screening to ensure someone isn't intending to use their gun to harm themselves or others. Then stiff penalties for people who don't secure their guns properly. \n\nI just wish more liberal politicans understood guns so they could write their legislation in such a way as to reduce gun violence. My own state has some of the lowest gun violence rates in the nation due to our red flag laws, background checks, requirements for safe storage, etc... But we also have dumb things like banning barrel shrouds and half-banning pistol grips on rifles.",
         "I\u2019ve experienced the same but I\u2019ve also recently seen some have a change of heart too. Sometimes it takes more than it should to wake people up but with the right push (depending on the person) it\u2019s not impossible.",
         "I think it\u2019s more difficult when they\u2019re at the second coming of Christ level. If they\u2019re like the man in the story, one who seems open to somebody convincing him otherwise, sure. But if he was convinced that Trump is the second coming of Christ, that\u2019s deeper. I think it\u2019s why the founding father didn\u2019t want politics to be mixed with religion, it can blind one to other things.",
         "This is how my husband\u2019s extended family is too. His aunt will wax poetic about how he\u2019s such a good strong Christian man who will bring Christian values to the whole country. Any bit of news that is contrary to that (basically all the news about 45) she immediately dismisses as the media making things up. It\u2019s mind boggling and incredibly sad.",
         "That\u2019s definitely true for the die hard MAGA (we all know the type). But for someone on the fence (sounds like this guy was at least partially), I think this is much more likely.",
         "I don't know. \u00a0He seems like maybe he wasn't quite as hardcore as some of these maga people, as can be seen from the fact that his wife wasn't afraid to say that she was voting for Harris in front of him. \u00a0I think maybe he had already been leaning that way because of his wife, but couldn't really bring himself to change his stance until someone else gave him an excuse to. \u00a0 Probably some unexamined misogyny on his part there. \u00a0But the canvasser might have been the straw that broke the camel's back.",
         "It depends on why they support Trump. If it's because their family all does, and the person isn't interested enough in politics to inform themselves, then they'll trust the people who love them. \n\nThis guy clearly didn't have all the facts, and was glad to get them.",
         "That's a dangerous presumption to have. Do you not think there are still people out there who are unsure of themselves on the things they do/are? There are still many LGBT people who have never seen the representation needed to know that their feelings are not just real, but valid. And like, lots of children have something they don't take to heart about their parents, and they frow up with that uncertainty.",
         "Is this true? If so, I thank you from the bottom of my heart. Tbh, I\u2019m concerned and anxious that Trump has so much support. Thank you for restoring my faith in people \ud83d\udc99",

         "I don't believe a 2016 MAGA was talked out of voting for trump in a couple minute conversation. I work with enough of them to know better. We don't need fake anecdotal stories to make us feel better about the election, we just need to vote.",

Though, any republican that has been paying attention should be able to see the danger that trump represents.
