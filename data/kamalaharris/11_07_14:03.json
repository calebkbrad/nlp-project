         "Mine did not get counted and I had to call. I live in a blue state but a red district. Every time I vote by mail I get an automated text message that says that my vote had been counted. I did not receive that this year. So I called the elections office and they told me that they sent out a postcard the day after they sent out the ballots. My postcard was returnedand marked, unable to be delivered. So when they receive my ballot back, they voided it. I had to call and verify my address. They said that they would reinstate my ballot. I still have not received a message that my vote was counted.",

There is not a similar central precinct in my county this year, or any other county. There is a column with vote type breaking down day of, or mailed ballot, but the early vote line in every county is blank.\u00a0\n\n\nI don't want to be conpiratorial,\u00a0 but this doesn't 100% make sense, particularly given how many folks here were early voting the day I went.\u00a0\n\n\nCan anyone wiser than me explain?",

         "In Singapore, didn't vote (am not American), but can't emphasise this enough. We aren't 100% confirmed yet, but it's highly likely. CHECK YOUR BALLOTS, and even if Trump wins this election, the fight isn't over! KEEP FIGHTING because we WILL WIN, it's not a matter of if, but when!",

         "Trump\u2019s last election was just practice for how to cheat.  He ordered post offices throughout Michigan and probably other states to close down automatic mail sorters, causing a massive back up because staffing was not able to keep up with demand. a I mean who sorts mail by hand these days? My ballot took 10 days to make it 2 miles down the road from my house to the counting location. I knew about the shenanigans so I mailed it a month ahead and kept checking to make sure it was received and also that I wasn\u2019t removed from voting rolls. It\u2019s a banana republic for sure these days.  This is why I voted in person on election day.",
         "I received an email that my absentee ballot was counted in Colorado. If you didn't receive an email or text or any contact from your county elections division you need to investigate. Especially because Democrats are more likely to vote by mail and they know this.",

All while our city council and mayor are complaining that the four voters and three city workers (two of them being poll workers) made \"innocent\" mistakes.  Yeah, right.  I wouldn't trust the city now to *not* discard or make an \"innocent\" mistake and not tabulate ours because we didn't vote for the orange shitstain.\n\nI agree something's up.  Just about anyone I know among family and friends who formerly voted Republican have voted Democratic this year (and many in 2020 did as well).  The math's not adding up.  I think they've had four years to throw shade about how Democrats have been \"stealing\" votes while setting up their own covert operations behind the scene.",

         "How to spread the word ? Can someone use mainstream media outlets to do so?",
         "Not sure how people aren't connecting the dots here. Take a look at EVERY SINGLE accusation that the GQP threw at the Dems over the last 8 years..... They ALL turned out to be true of their own party.\n\nIf you think the claims of cheating aren't the same exact thing - you are blind \n\nTrump cheated. I have piles of papers proving it. It would blow your mind. Harris would have won almost every state had it not been for these scumbag criminals. When the truth comes out it's going to be a BLOODBATH. Stand back and stand by!",
         "Anyone have any idea when my vote would show up in the \"voting history\" in Ohio's voter info page? My ballot is listed as \"being counted\" on the absentee page. But it's not in the voting history yet.",

And I\u2019d bet the convenient \u201cRussia bomb threats\u201d in swing states only were designed as a distraction while someone messed with the voting process. My 2 cents.",
         "Do we believe that Russia deliberately targeted state after state with false bomb threats to have ZERO effect other than a temporary inconvenience offset by the voting place staying open longer?  Or that Russia targeted state after state so the voting place was less monitored for election tampering?  OR the bomb threats were to place scrutiny on the WRONG voting places so it would be easier for tampering with other voting places to go unnoticed?\n\nBaby monitors can be hacked. Can voting booths?\n\nCan a program be run that, for instance, deletes 10 or 15% of the overall vote and then flips another 3 to 5% to red?\n\nThen there\u2019s this:\n\n\u201cThough stories of long lines and extended wait times to vote popped up on election night throughout the Philadelphia area, for the most part, overall fewer voters in the region turned out to vote on Tuesday, Nov. 5, 2024, than the 2020 presidential election.\u201d\n\nThe entire article (link below) is full of worrisome hard to believe data. It\u2019s the big counties that vote blue that have a ton of voters that didn\u2019t vote. Numbers are down from 2020 despite historic voting numbers. \n\nHer rallies broke records. His rallies were poorly attended. Her donations broke records. Does it add up that LESS voters showed up in blue counties when voting records were being broken all over the country?  \n\nThey need to make sure mail-in ballots weren\u2019t \u201clost.\u201d They need to make sure there was no hacking done on voting booths. Etc.\n\nThey need to make 210% certain (Check and then check again) that this election was not interfered with\u2026 \n\nIf we lost, we hand the reins of power over peacefully. But, first make sure we lost. \n\nOne of Hitler\u2019s strategies was to use psychology as a weapon (Like Axis Sally) against their enemies. Our fierce belief in the peaceful transition of power could be counted upon to cause us to not closely look for election tampering. \n\nWhat if Trump accusing Bucks County and  Philly of cheating were simply to make the later election results look more credible\u2026 \n\nBeing the good guys means we respect our constitution and democracy. It also means we make sure there was no election interference. \n\nRussia is too smart to just resort to some silly clown car show of easily-handled false bomb threats\u2026\n\nIf we lost, we lost. It\u2019s horrible, but we accept it. First, let\u2019s make sure we truly lost. \n\n[https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/decision-2024/voter-turnout-throughout-philly-area-mostly-lower-than-2020/4020775/](https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/decision-2024/voter-turnout-throughout-philly-area-mostly-lower-than-2020/4020775/)",

Kamala knew that as VP. \n\nIran, NK, Venezuela, Cuba are all ancillaries to the greater problem that is Russia and China. Russia is just the more belligerent, overt force. China does it with smiles, trade and debt with veiled threats as compared to overt force. But they're building up to that more and more every day. Deal with Russia and China is more isolated and wary. Give into Russia, and China takes notes while buying the time they feel they need in the interim. \n\nA US that turns inward allows for the testing of waters, and the possibility of minimizing 'x' as not being worth an isolationist US' time. \n\nThat's why this election is so painful, not just for the dire domestic issues that will come. Globally, we've just really hurt democracies around the world in the preservation and defense of those ideals from the autocracies who hunger and thrive off of control.

As if the record donations, markers of blue enthusiasm being high (packed rallies, Dem enthusiasm to vote highest since 2008), and the polls showing an extremely close race were nothing. \n\nShe lost because the mood of the country shifted in a way that was not captured by the earlier polls, which turned out to be horribly wrong. Therefore the campaign\u2019s messaging, which she executed beautifully, turned out to be ineffective.",
         "Excerpts:\n\n\"The outcome of this election is not what we wanted, not what we fought for, not what we voted for,\" Harris said. \"But hear me when I say, hear me when I say, the light of America's promise will always burn bright as long as we never give up and as long as we keep fighting.\"",
         "There are a lot of apathetic democratic voters. People who are frustrated with the system, believe everything is corrupt, and never see any improvement in their lives no matter who is in charge -- but tend to have pretty open minded, liberal views.\n\nThese people turned up in 2020. I think we can all remember the absurdity of the pandemic, and there was a lot of anger about how it was being dealt with. Combine this with a huge surge in mail-in voting programs, where ballots were mailed to voters who simply had to fill them out and mail them back. This made it easy for angry people to just vote in 20 seconds and get it over with.\n\nBut these people weren't impressed by Kamala. They don't have a major emergency affecting their lives to ignite their passion. They've gone back to largely not giving a shit about politics, which is how they usually live their lives.",
         "I think a lot of people didn\u2019t vote because they think both sides are corrupt. In 2020, we were coming off 4 years of chaos and a pandemic so people were motivated to vote. This time some people were too lazy. FAFO coming.",

Continuing the campaign would give her and Dems the chance to completely change their relationship with voters, to a highly populist party fighting for everyday people against the big money selfish interests Trump represents.\n\nShe\u2019d definitely have to fight in an open primary, but that\u2019d be a good thing.\n\nKamala 2028!",

Biden inherited a horrible situation both in terms of the ongoing pandemic and in lack of legislative support. He did a great job considering the context, but a lot of people are hurting. I doubt many voters are interested in the international context because if they were, they would have seen how well Biden has done taking it on here (even though it was still pretty rough). We need to find a better way to put out simple messaging that will reach people on key issues.\n\nI don\u2019t know if there is a candidate who could have won this election under the circumstances Kamala inherited. Trump and the Republicans spent the last four years preparing to take office, whereas Politico [reported her campaign had issues with surrogates and ground game in key swing states like PA](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/06/how-bidens-vulnerabilities-led-to-a-bloodbath-for-harris-00187807). She did an incredible job of rallying enthusiasm, but even a sprint through the tape wasn\u2019t enough at that point.\n\nGoing forward, we need to start preparing NOW for the midterms in case we have the opportunity to vote meaningfully then. We lost this election in 2021 and 2022. I was so hopeful Kamala was going to do it, but we came up short.",

         "They were never \"missing voters\" Biden got 15 million EXTRA voters. The turnout totals for 2024 were right in line with the averages for the last 20 years. It was 2020 that was abnormally high. \n\nBiden activated an army of unlikely voters in 2020. Harris didnt.",
         "We're still processing the main reasons, and things can shift so fast it's impossible to 100% confirm things, but for the most part, I think Harris/Walz ran a solid campaign that just didn't vibe or match many.\n\nHarris being black and female unfortunately hurt with many people for very stupid and bigoted reasons, but inflation and the economy was just too much for Harris to overcome despite it being good on a macro level due to the information environment being terrible for Dems, and especially due to greedflation. The border hurt too, especially with Latinos and other minorities given that there's a non-negligible percentage of them who do not like illegals when they came over legally. Sadly, many didn't seem to care about Trump's character flaws and just voted on issues, not character.\n\nOne thing that scares me, but I also find plausible, is mentioned in this tweet:\n\n[Lyndon Baines Johnson on X: \"We're still reasoning this out, and will write about it at length -- but the rough thought is that the rapid progress of Civil Rights in the late 60s produced backlash, and comparable forces are mounting against LGBTQ. We're against repeating the past. -OS\" / X](https://x.com/lyndonbajohnson/status/1854397631071412503)\n\nI do fear that oppression against LGBTQ+ folks is only going to get worse, and that a lot of what happened on Tuesday might've been a sign. The worst thing the Dems could do is run away from civil rights. They need to figure out a clear and concise message for 2026 and 2028.",
         "Looking at WA State registered voter turnout numbers: 2024 was 58%.  2020: 84%.  That translates to nearly 600,000 votes.  \n\nWhy?  I don't know, but people simply decided to not vote.  I'm guessing it's not unique or different than the rest of the country.",

Trump ran a campaign of basically being not Biden/Harris and embodying that demo even though older and clearly not working class. that's basically what I learned from the exit poll demo.\n\nIs that Harris fault? Not really. You can't convince on policy when that demo is basically voting for a personification of themselves to be in the WH. So you have to dog whistle messaging on a working class baby boomer white male. \"What I am doing for you, just you, and really no one else in the country.\"",

         "It makes me so angry to see people both within and outside of the party try to throw her under the bus. Sorry, but saying that Tim Walz or Michelle Obama (yes ppl have said her name) or some other random person could have won ignores that millions of people chose hatred and selfishness and willful ignorance. It\u2019s also incredibly disrespectful and insulting. Kamala is an intelligent, experienced woman who worked her ass off in just 107 days. Love and support her for who she is instead of saying that if she was white or a man it could have been different.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s also making me feel very conflicted because people are half-joking that Dems will never nominate another woman in the next few decades and so I\u2019m going to be watching carefully to see whether they can actually fix core issues in the party and the way it operates or if they just keep women at arm\u2019s length of the nomination for the foreseeable future. People are mentioning Whitmer for 2028 and I love her but I will also be very critical if she is treated differently than Harris.\u00a0\n\nAnyway, sorry for the rant. Tired of seeing Black women be dismissed, scapegoated, and fucked over. Kamala, you deserved better in so many ways.\u00a0",

         "Kamala Harris was made captain of a sinking ship, which was the re-election campaign of an unpopular President in a global climate where all incumbents are unpopular regardless of ideology.\n\nOutside the liberal bubble, Harris was seen as Biden's VP and Biden was unpopular. That's it. She had the unenviable choice of trying to save the ship (defending Biden) or abandoning it. There probably was no right answer and either way she was going down. \n\nIMHO, her biggest mistake was in an effort to build unity, she brought in too many DNC/Obama people that ran the same ineffective campaign and ineffective messaging as Hillary Clinton did in 2016, instead of sticking more to what Biden did that won. Republicans were going to tie her to Biden no matter what she did. No separation was going to be possible, only fighting the attacks. As long as Biden's disapproval rates remained high, she was done. \n\nMeanwhile, the Biden-Harris turnout machine was the part of her campaign that worked the best, keeping her in the game in the swing states where she was getting buried elsewhere. The choice of Governor Walz was brilliant. Shapiro would not have won her Pennsylvania and probably only got the large margins in the Governor's race due to a weak opponent and Trump not being on the ballot. \n\nShe ran a good campaign, but the election might have simply been unwinnable.",

She was virtually unknown when she became the nominee and managed to close the gap significantly when people got to know her. Trump has been running for the last 9 years straight.\n\nAnd it\u2019s also looking like economic concerns were the driving force behind Trump\u2019s win. Incumbents around the world have lost recently due to inflation. Whether it\u2019s right or not, people just want to punish the party in power for their everyday struggles. \n\nKamala would have an opportunity to be a clear reminder of what we could have had, keep reminding people about the things Democrats wanted to do to help people and how it\u2019d be better than what Trump is doing, keep Trump\u2019s actual impact on our everyday lives in view, and keep building her name recognition.\n\nShe could spend the next four years traveling the country talking to working class people about their everyday struggles, and connecting that to policy proposals. Imagine her sitting around the dinner table with Trump voters in Montana and hearing about their grocery bills and healthcare debt, and talking about what might help them out. But also hearing about how uncomfortable they are with DEI or abortion, and presenting a reasonable counter perspective.\n\nI think a big part of Democrats\u2019 problem has been that we just feel like politicians. We awkwardly read through teleprompters and carefully consider every word in interviews out of fear of saying the wrong thing. Trump and everyone around him have built a brand around doing the opposite, and all that matters is that they don\u2019t seem like politicians.\n\nWe need to reinvent the party, and I feel like Kamala is in a great position to lead the charge, but she needs to do it right away or she\u2019ll fade away and her career in politics will be over.",

I think she can be an Al Gore type figure if she works towards a social cause, just like Gore has with Global Warming. I won't ever hold any resentment towards her at all.\n\nI enjoyed the time I spent with you all here. I am not giving up.

I actually cried watching his inaugural address, as it was such a relief to have a stable, kind adult in the oval office after the chaos and stress of Trump.\n\nBut Kamala\u2019s campaign checked all of the boxes for me.

So let their courage be our inspiration, let their determination be our charge.\n\nThen she concluded by saying\uff1a\n\n> And I will close with this:\n>\n> There\u2019s an adage and historian once called a law of history, true of every society across the ages.

         "Despite all sorts of hopeful posturing from good people trying to put a positive spin on this mess ( \u201cit\u2019s just another bad 4 years\u201d) I think the US just cast it\u2019s last free vote. This time, Trump is surrounded by the enablers he needs to fundamentally undermine democracy, and they think that\u2019s okay. Therefore, I see us entering a time of great volatility. Economic recession. More war. Intolerance. And I wonder how fast this will all unravel.\n\nI am not doing okay, and I am try to figure out how best to survive the coming storm.\n\nSelfishly, I am thinking about the economic impact that will come into play in 2025. Even Trump\u2019s best buddies predict that the cost of goods will increase. Even Elon Musk predicted this will be so: Trump\u2019s economic plans will lead to \u2018hardship\u2019 and cause markets to \u2018tumble\u2019 | The Independent\n\nGlobally - Zelensky and other politicians around the world are congratulating Trump and doing the normal diplomatic thing. But nothing is \"normal\". In truth, I think that Ukraine will now lose the support of the US; Russia, with the aid of North Korea, will take the Ukraine. Russia will be emboldened and could now take other USSR satellite states back, which was always Putin's ambition. The Middle East is in trouble; while the US may not send troops, it may send more money and weapons.\u00a0While I used to dismiss the idea of Iran retaliation against the US, I no longer feel confident that I can afford to be dismissive. \n\nMeanwhile, the USA may abandon NATO at some point, or else stay within NATO in order to disempower the alliance and it's member countries from within.\u00a0\n\nThe issue with MAGA on a US societal level is that MAGA gives permission to be openly homophobic, racist and misogynist. Anyone not following conservative role norms is in trouble.\n\nIn certain US states, the MAGA Republicans have been banning books (usually the ones that say anything positive about homosexuals or about evolution being real). Historically, the \"good guys\" do not ban books, and even \"Mein Kampf\" is available so that we may all learn from the wrongs of history. It's okay to read a book and conclude that you disagree with it, but to ban or burn it is another thing.\n\nPeter Theil \u00a0- he\u2019s the man who paid for JD Vance\u2019s education and for Vance\u2019s electoral campaign and who ultimately pulls a lot of the strings controlling what Vance says and does, and Elon Musk are the new oligarchs of the USA. (For now, we will ignore that Theil is gay and also a misogynist who thinks that women should not have the vote. Elon and Peter have history \u2013 they started PayPal and made their first fortunes together.\u00a0(The Broligarchs Are Trying to Have Their Way - The Atlantic\u00a0) If Trump kicks the bucket due to whatever, these are the guys who will be running the show, and they do not believe in democracy (Americans need to \u201cget over their dictator phobia\u201d \u2013 Valley Letter), or as Theil phrased it, \u201cI no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible.\u201d. \n\nI think the age of American Empire is palpably in decline. I fear the chaos which comes with this phase of history.\u00a0\n\nTrump's victory is happening on a platform of deregulation, isolationism and authoritarian leadership, and is without precedent in modern American history. \"Promises made, promises kept,\" Trump said in his victory speech.\n\nI also know what Project 2025 says, even beyond the cartoon version:\u00a0The Project 2025 Song!. \u00a0Schedule F permits a President do away with government departments and dismiss employees; many jobs that used to be independent could now be political appointments. Government \u201cefficiency\u201d and oversight is Elon Musk\u2019s new job (Trump says he'd put Elon Musk in charge of proposed efficiency commission \"if he has the time\" - CBS News). Along with mass deportations, reproductive choice is gone, and how does MAGA intend to rid itself of \u201cthe enemy within\u201d? \u00a0Last time he was President, Trump suggested using the military to control \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d protesters.\n\nI imagine the first few years of Trump's reign will be dedicated to bringing the USA into line with authoritarian control.\n\nIn closing, this fragment of a poem was shared with me today:\n\nempires\nare always rising and falling, and whole civilizations\ndie, they do, they get wiped out, this happens\nall the time, it\u2019s just a shock when it happens to your civilization,\nyour country\n\n\u00a0",

A con artist, a failed businessman, a TV charlatan and the worst president we have ever had who presided over millions of needless COVID deaths, dined with terrorists and dictators, dishonored our veterans, trashed our economy, spurned our allies, rubbed shoulders with pedophiles, cheated on his wives, convicted of 34 felony counts, and would have been convicted of far more if it weren\u2019t for the justice department dragging its feet and the complicity of corrupt justices appointed by the accused. That man won re-election.\n\nThe average voter is an idiot. The sheer majority of voters don\u2019t care about qualifications or experience or anything meaningful. They vote their feelings like stupid, stupid children.\n\nWhy do I promote comedians like Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert for public office? Because they\u2019re funny. They make people laugh. And in addition to being intelligent, they are good, decent human beings. We will never win against Republican candidates like Trump. Despite all his terrible qualities, he has honed his charisma over a lifetime of scamming people. We have to fight fire with fire. Hillary lost not because she wasn\u2019t qualified, she lost because she wasn\u2019t likeable. Even Harris was overqualified, and even more likeable than Biden (who won purely because of how bad Trump was handling things\u2026but people have short memories). But our nation hasn\u2019t evolved to the point of overcoming both racism and sexism. If we couldn\u2019t convince 20 million people who voted in the last election to make the effort for Harris against such a monumentally terrible opponent, we need to change our strategy.\n\nWe need a candidate who will humiliate his opponent and make voters laugh as he does it. We don\u2019t need to convince the opposition\u2019s supporters to vote for our candidate using reasonable arguments, we just need to make it too embarrassing to consider voting for people like Trump. They need to be made to feel emasculated, to finally feel ashamed of voting for Republicans and their policies. Nothing robs a tyrant of power more than being laughed at.\n\nSo shove your hoity toity ideas about what a proper candidate should be.

That's the mark of a true leader.  Could you imagine Trump doing the same if he lost?  No, he'd just incite another riot and go unpunished as per usual.\n\nI hope Harris knows what an inspiration she has been to so many people.  She is the real winner in this scenario.",

Sadly, the left has them too, and that shit voter turnout made that clear.   \n  \nIt sickens me to think that this is the reason, but let's face it. This IS who America is today. America elected Trump - a hateful, sociopathic, narcissistic convicted felon who has trouble with telling the truth and not behaving like a toddler. That says TONS about who America is now.

The economy was probably the largest issue. The truth is we have had the strongest recovery of any country post pandemic but at the end of the day, people don\u2019t care about that, they care about prices of food and housing right now. There are still a lot of people, including women that simply believe we are not ready for a woman president. Hillary was favored by FAR more in 2016 and also lost by significant margins. While abortion was incredibly important, and rightfully so, for many, it was not connecting, especially among young men, black men and Latino men who turned out in much higher numbers than expected. Finally, Kamala had the headwinds of Biden being very unpopular. While I don\u2019t agree with that, the truth is his approval rating was 40% and the one thing the republicans were successful at was connecting her to his administration. Gaza also hurt her tremendously despite the fact Trump being categorically be worse on that issue. \n\nThe one thing that most people from both sides agreed on was that the country was on the wrong track (for very different reasons) and when that is the sentiment that many people believe, it often leads to people voting for \u201cperceived\u201d change or in the case of democrats, apathy.",

Because I can guarantee you the founding fathers never intended for the Constitution to be used to elect a tyrant.\n\nSo if when all votes are in, if Harris ends up with the popular vote, I think Biden does have a democratic mandate under which to take extraordinary action.\n\nI think Biden intentionally referenced the declaration of Independence in his withdrawal from the race, to remind us that this election was about tyranny. \n\nSo the question is, does Biden leave us to eventually rebel under neofascist tyranny? Or does he start the rebellion now, while we hold the White House? In an attempt to reboot the Constitution?\n\n>The simplest solution would be to make a law that says no felon can become POTUS, the end.\n\nYes. \n\nFrom a *Justice* standpoint, the better solution would be to declare Trump and top MAGA leadership (including congressional members and justices involved in the conspiracy) a domestic terrorism organization. Arrest them. And sign an executive order saying that anyone under prosecution for domestic terrorism cannot hold government office. \n\nBut that would create the biggest crisis since the civil War.

The numbers don't make sense, especially since so many people had enthusiasm towards Harris while Trump was growing more and more unpopular to the point where it started showing in his own crowds and then so many Republicans sharing testimonies as to why they're never voting for Trump again. And then after all this, he suddenly wins the popular vote with more votes towards him than a Republican has had in two decades, and then also wins in a landslide while also flipping the Senate and now possibly taking the House too? It just doesn't make sense when you line it up with the enthusiasm towards Harris compared to the lack of it towards him. And while I do believe people did sit out this election, I also seriously doubt 15-20 million would sit this out given how much enthusiasm and energy was put towards people voting on both sides this year. It just doesn't make any sense to me.\n\nI do get that Harris would want to set a good example for America with accepting her loss compared to Trump, but I still think that Democrats playing too nice and staying in the background has been a huge problem. She can still accept the loss, but still look into anything if it seems suspicious, especially when things don't add up. And right now, she has a better chance of being able to take it in court, especially before January 20th if she did decide to go that route. I agree that a lot more should of been done about Trump that wasn't though.. and if the courts actually did do something and truly held him accountable, we wouldn't be in this position. What this country is missing is integrity, especially with this and them not wanting to imprison him because it would affect the results of the election. Well that's exactly why he should of been put in prison, because he's a felon, and courts need to uphold THEIR OWN laws instead of expecting us to when they can't even lead that same example.\n\nEdit: Fixed a typo",

And I know that a lot of voter suppression efforts Republicans were trying to be put in law that were denied by the courts, and then there has been them trying voter intimidation for the longest time (which I actually don't think worked as well this time). But tbh I do feel like at least some voter suppression and possibly even voter fraud was involved in this election, and it could be a big explanation as to why he suddenly got so many votes despite the lack of enthusiasm towards him. I will agree that a lot of it is also our country's stupidity playing a part of it because of all the cult mentality MAGA has. \n\n> If ballots have gone missing or something, what would a recount show?\n\nImo it would either show the complete opposite of what actually happened, or if Trump did turn out to still get more votes, it would of at least shown that he got less than what they're saying right now. Then again who knows since I definitely underestimated our country's stupidity and their hate towards women. \n\n> I think it's easier to accept people voted out of ignorance than the vote was rigged. Hanlon's razor and all that.\n\nI think it's definitely both in this case. \n\n> The biggest issue I think is actually the lack of education.\n\nThe sheer amount of people who don't understand correlation != causation is a huge factor here.\n\nI flat out think the people of this country are a bigger problem than Trump himself or what he represents.\n\nI definitely agree with you. And you'd think that after what's happened in the past (especially with Germany), we would know better, but I guess not. The uneducated people who voted for him are the root of the problem, and so is the media who's always been biased towards Republicans and owned by them. He got elected mainly because of the economy, but MAGA doesn't even realize or even think about the fact that he's a failed businessman in debt.. and they really think he's gonna help the economy? Yeah right. \ud83d\ude44 People have always been easier to manipulate than they have to educate, and I wish a lot more people were willing to learn something new than to accept the status quo."

There are a lot of people in America who live paycheck to paycheck, and there are a lot of seniors on a fixed income.  I voted for Kamala, and my whole family did.  I have significantly benefited from the booming stock market.  Most Americans can't scrap up $1000 for an emergency.  On top of high prices, it was ludicrous for the Biden Administration to let so many undocumented immigrants into the country.  He played right into Trump's hand, and Trump took advantage of that.  I know he killed the Bipartisan Immigration Bill, but it was after Biden allowed so many immigrants into the country.  You may not like this message, but that is why he won.  I thought Kamala ran a great campaign.  She's a gifted politician, much better than Clinton.  She organized her campaign in record time and came very close to winning.  I didn't know much about her before she became the nominee, but she really impressed me with her energy.  I hope the Democrats will learn from this.  Immigration is their blindspot, just as abortion is for the GOP.  If Trump sticks to his promise and deports them all, America will quickly learn the value they've brought when prices skyrocket again.",

His vile rhetoric was disgusting. His own party tried to kill him twice. And now he's going back to the White House again.

Getting out to overlooked rural communities and smaller cities is where she should have been, and it was gnawing at me that she wasn't doing this. However, she didn't have time on her side to do that--she had to rush the entire campaign due to the limited amount of time she had to get everywhere she needed to be.  \n\nWe may move to a blue state to see if we can preserve some sort of protections in our lives, but this country is *so* f\\*\\*ked now.

The dems and liberal leaning talking heads have blamed working class men for just about every problem and dismissed them off hand. \n\nAnd honestly we can't ignore the stuff like dems ignoring class issues and blaming poor white voters for issues that they have no control over while acting like other affluent groups (like Indian Americans, the most affluent ethnic group in the US) are somehow oppressed. \n\nSo the dems are losing both in terms of class and ethnicity and still haven't learned their lesson that religious conservatives are not really democrats, they're not allies and never were. Coalition building only goes so far when half the coalition actively hates you (like these religious social conservatives don't like queer people).",

And really the media is all he\u2019ll need. Even democrats will start to be fooled, either because they don\u2019t feel like stressing about it anymore, are scared to oppose a dictator, want to join the winning team, or they finally succumb to the firehose of falsehoods. \n\nIt is in our best interests to acknowledge that we have fallen to fascism. We should aim to destabilize the system, not play into its hand. I\u2019m talking real guerrilla tactics. We are going to need inside saboteurs, spies, and foreign allies.

All while the right encouraged the idea of Fake News and twisted truths. \n\nNow, in 2024, they can theoretically commit mass fraud and throw all of the Left's statements back in their face if they call them on it. If anything comes to light, they spout off about Fake News and misinformation. \n\nTrump hoodwinked the entire country. \n\nI just hope, with the slimmest little glimmer, because Al Gore and Bush's election was crazy.. that maybe, just maybe, something historic will happen. That democracy will prevail. That any fraud comes to light casting doubt on his count. That anyone's votes that weren't counted because their ballot boxes were under threat or bombed (look up headlines)... That they are able to still somehow fulfill their patriotic duty. That Kamala doesn't concede, and the hopeful truth comes to light. \n\nThat maybe it's her that is sworn in on inauguration day when this all ends.\n\nOur history has been stained with darkness, time, and time again, and the People did not lay down for it. We spoke out, and stood our ground. We can again. \n\nI just hope that good will prevail, no matter how naive that may sound. It is human. I am human. We are human. I hope for our humanity. I will hold out hope until the last vote is counted, and possibly recounted, and possibly investigated.\n\nBut in the end, no matter what, I will never stop believing that goodness, justice, and democracy will win.

Grated I don\u2019t get out often but I\u2019d put money on the fact that these ads run non stop as I\u2019ve heard them almost every time I\u2019m in the car running short errands a few times a week. \n\nI\u2019ve never heard a Kamala ad but I\u2019ve seen them on the tv but she never disputes the claims. Nor did she in her Rally\u2019s or during interviews. I think it was a huge mistake because they laser focused on her comment that she had never been to the border and inflamed the lies regarding border numbers and all blame on her. Plus gas prices and groceries which I hear so many complain about. I think these truly hurt her by not confronting head on and debunking!!!",

         "While foreign policies and Israel\u2019s mass genocide is a big concern for Americans, statistically most have been concerned for state of democracy WITHIN this country and the economy. I\u2019ve spoken to a couple of Trump supporters in my area, many of them make discriminatory comments about Kamala while also having a disillusioned state of mind Trump brings \u201cunity\u201d; which of course he does, he brings unity to white hetero cis Americans who benefit directly from white empowerment. \n\nProposing a bipartisan with Israel instead of assertively claiming she would cut Israel off from U.S. support isn\u2019t the main factor why Kamala is currently underperforming; a lot of people have been severely misinformed about immigrants and the economy due to fear mongering from Trump administration and Republicans. Also people simply not believing a woman should be our image of representing the president of the United States\u2014 it\u2019s unfortunate, but a WOC Madame President in the current state of hate and division that has been witnessed numerous times in U.S. history is really a dream you desperately wish can happen, but in reality too many men\u2014even some women\u2014truly will forever consider women less than dirt.",

So yes he has still lost in liberal places but by less than he has before. And he is still winning in conservative places but by a higher percent. Thus he is overperforming.",

         "I think a major problem in Christianity right now is viewing support for certain social issues as what makes one a \"good\" christian. I feel like it is the sociopolitical institutions of certain churches saying this, rather than faith inspired by a balanced reading of the Bible. How can abortion or marijuana, things not even mentioned explicitly (only by joining together verses) be more important than the actual words of Jesus himself calling out hypocrites and helping the sick and poor, or the Ten Commandments handed down by God himself on Mt. Sinai, calling out the sins of adultery, lying and jealousy. I also question why many self-professed Christians feel the need to make sin illegal. Although it is not our place to judge, wouldn't God give them a greater punishment anyway?\n\nAt the end of the day, most Christians should be agree that what makes one a Christian is belief in Jesus' divinity and his plan for salvation, not how you vote.\n\nSorry if I came off a little ranty: It really bothers me though how many people use the name of Jesus to hurt people and selectively pick Christian doctrine to suit their needs. It reminds me of the chopped up Bibles they gave to control the slaves. For the record, I myself am a Christian, although I am distrustful of the institution of the church currently and am unchurched at the moment. I also acknowledge the Bible can be interpreted a lot of ways, and there are a lot of Christian faith traditions that have widely varying views on both scripture and social issues.",

I have a bad feeling that we have lost the youth by seeing their Jesus loving parents voting for Trump and not being able up reconcile those two things. \n\nAs for abortion/pro choice, my argument is that the law of the land doesn't push people to have them,  it just gives them an option.   I'd love to see all the money and effort that goes to prolife to instead focus on reaching women in crisis and making adoption a realistic option for more Americans.  If you belive in a sovereign God, he knows what is going to happen with the pregnancy.  He doesn't need laws to help that, and we are not a Christian nation so it's ok if the laws of the land don't always reflect Christian views. \n\nWeed I'm more pragmatic.

         "\n\nThere are many Trump supporters, who have fallen under the sway of Christian Nationalism, believing they are bringing about \"God's kingdom on Earth.\" The hubris and arrogance is mind-boggling!\n\nMany Trump supporters believe that Trump is or has become Christian, following a path of repenting and starting a new life.\n\nLet\u2019s see:\n\nHe has been caught on tape attacking Gold Star family members and bragging about grabbing women by their genitals. \n\nA jury found him liable for sexually abusing a woman and defaming her. \n\nHe's bragged about extramarital affairs. \n\nA repentant sinner would apologize for these actions and make amends to the victims. Trump has never apologized. He never will.\n\nIn his letter to the Galatians, Saint Paul wrote that \u201cthe fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control.\u201d\nThese fruits are not in Donald Trump. \n\nChristian Nationalism misrepresents the character of God as exclusive and hateful. The Jesus of Christian Nationalism bears little resemblance to the one written about in the four gospels. The Christian Nationalist \u201cJesus\u201d does not teach His followers to beat their swords into plowshares, or to become the meek who will inherit the earth, or to love enemies, or even to love our neighbor as ourselves.\n\nWaving the Bible about without being contrite is hypocrisy. Even more, the selling of the bible with the added constitution and bill of rights, and the lyrics to Lee Greenwood's \"I'm Proud to be An American\" is heresy, it is an abomination!\n\nTo follow someone like that is idolatry. Encourage believers to honestly evaluate Donald Trump by biblical standards.\n\nJesus warned that the final deceptions would be in His name, (Matthew 24). In closing the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus warned about those who profess to do marvelous deeds in His name, but do not know Jesus.\n\nThe final apostasy that places humanity beyond the possibility of repentance and redemption creates a Jesus in our own image and worships a counterfeit Jesus who expects His people to assert God\u2019s authority on earth. \n\nThis is not Christianity!",

They dress the wound of my people as though it were not serious. \u2018Peace, peace,\u2019 they say, when there is no peace. Are they ashamed of their detestable conduct? No, they have no shame at all; they do not even know how to blush.\u201d Jeremiah 6:14-16 \n\nIn this passage from the Bible, God is upset. The religious people of the day are exploiting harmful problems for personal, political gain and not addressing their true solutions. They act like they care, but intentionally allow the issues to remain unresolved. They outwardly insist that they desire a way forward, but inwardly they have no real desire at all. \n\nTrump and many conservative Evangelicals treat \u201cabortion\u201d the same. They outwardly declare that they are \u201cpro-life\u201d and detest abortion. They feverishly rant against how many \u201cbabies\u201d are being murdered. Many make abortion their defining issue as to the reason why they support Trump. They posture themselves as wanting to make it illegal, as if that was the cure. It all looks and sounds so spiritual to the casual observer. Yet, inwardly, they have little-to-no heart for a real solution. For if they did, they would be addressing, providing for, and adopting the proven remedies that positively impact abortion. But, they don\u2019t. \n\nInstead, with deceit, they want to keep the abortion issue alive because it manipulates their voters. It\u2019s a political false flag, the last card they have in their deck. Without it, they have no drum to beat and no provocative enemy upon which to summon their troops to fight. The need to create the illusion that they lead the way against abortion while making sure it remains unresolved, that they might remain in power. \n\nIn fact, perfectly credible and widely known statistics show that abortion rates have gone down significantly with the kind of Democratic leadership that approaches abortion wholistically and addresses the real issues that can bring real change. Yet sadly, these same statistics reveal that under Republican leadership, abortion significantly increases\u2013that\u2019s the facts. Yet, with Trump at their side, conservatives \u201ddo not even know how to blush\u201d at the truth about abortion, how they expoit it, and how they resist actual remedies. Instead, they declare \u201cPro-life, pro-life\u201d where there is no pro-life among them. All in hopes of drowning the biblical voice crying out in the wilderness, \u201cMake straight the ways of the Lord to heal abortion and cure its causes.\u201d  \n\nLike most people, I detest abortion. I want to see it become a non-issue in our society. I want to see it remedied by real people who really care, who are willing to apply the difficult, but real solutions that work. I\u2019m tired of people who are more interested in politics than life.\n\nThat\u2019s why I can\u2019t vote for Trump, the Bible tells me so.",
         "Funny thing, there actually IS a part of the Bible that talks about abortion - and the only mention of it is how to properly perform it as a test of the woman's \"faithfulness\" to her husband (Numbers 5: 11-31 if you're curious).",

         "I don\u2019t know why that was downvoted. It\u2019s what many so-called Christians have said they believe. \n\nIs the belief that trump serves Christian values abhorrent? Certainly in my opinion it is. But, Christians have chosen to accept being lied to for nearly 2000 years so accepting lies now isn\u2019t that much of a stretch. That has been especially true at certain times in history, now being one of those times, especially since the rise of evangelicalism. \n\nBefore anyone starts beating on me about Christian values and lies that have been believed, let me say that I believe that Christianity went off the rails (i e., not following the actual teachings of Christ) fairly early in its development. The religion that developed around the teachings perverted them through the greed (for power and/or profit). IMO, true Christian values are those of honoring God and loving other humans (but not in a creepy trump or Matt Gaetz way).",

         "Or, how about unrepentant sin.\n\nMost everyone agrees that sin is bad. Even Trump supporters acknowledge that he is an overly sinful man. All of the Seven Deadly Sins listed in the Bible, Trump blatantly exudes\u2013no question about that. In fact, for some Trump supporters, they love his rebellious spirit, even against God. Yet, right in the face of the Bible, Christians who support Trump wave their many flags of excuses such as, \u201cEveryone sins,\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re not electing a pastor\u201d or, \u201cLook at David in the Bible, he sinned, but God used him.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, those statements are true. However, in Scripture, there is a huge, defining difference. God never raised up anyone for leadership who didn\u2019t first repent of their sins. Not one, period. Scripturally, repentance has always been a precursor for being lifted up by God.\n\nYet, without any pause in their biblical steps, for many Christians who support Trump, they believe God anointed Him for leadership and to do His will in America and beyond. However, given the fact that Trump has never repented of his sins, even when given the chance, this is a biblical impossibility. In fact, in many conservative Evangelical churches, Trump couldn\u2019t even qualify to become their janitor without a repentance of sins, but somehow he can become their God-appointed President?\n\nStill to this day, Trump refuses to repent. How do I know? The \u201cfruits of repentance\u201d that John the Baptist insisted upon in Scripture are nowhere to be found in Trump. \n\n\u201cBut when John saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his place of baptism, he said to them, \u2018You brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the coming wrath? Produce fruit, then, in keeping with repentance.\u2019\u201d Mathew 3:7-8\n\nTrump is undeniably the same lying, profane, greedy, mocking, bullying, divisive, jealous, arrogant, narcissistic, and hateful man he was at the beginning of his presidency. That\u2019s not a judgement, it\u2019s an inescapable observation. Despite the lipstick Evangelicals want to put on this pig, God is not interested in Trump\u2019s appearances of meeting with Evangelicals, closing his eyes during prayers, randomly using Christian jargon, or waving a Bible around. Instead, He is interested in a humble, genuinely contrite heart. Sadly, a heart Trump neither has nor apparently desires.\n\nAs Jesus warned in Scripture, no unrepented, sin-ladened Trump-like tree can \u201cproduce good fruit.\u201d \n\nI want divine goodness for America. I want integrity and decency in our leadership. I want humble, teachable, kind people at the helm who show strength through maturity and stability.\n\nThat\u2019s why I can\u2019t vote for Trump, the Bible tells me so.\n\nBut, what about the lies?\n\nYes, 20,000 documented lies or misleading statements since Trump was elected. Certainly, by now, he must be giving the Father of Lies a run for his money. With this blatant stronghold of deceit and lying manifested in Trump\u2019s life and leadership, to willfully follow him, vote for him, or give him loyalty is to pledge yourself to evil, is it not? How can it be anything different?\n\n\u201cNo one who practices deceit shall dwell in my house; no one who utters lies shall continue before my eyes.\u201d Psalm 101:7\n\n\u201cEloquent lips are unsuited to a godless fool\u2014how much worse lying lips to a ruler!\u201d Proverbs 17:7\n\n\u201cLying lips are an abomination to the Lord\u201d Proverbs 12:22\n\nMost Christian Trump supporters insist that the LGBTQ community is biblically declared an \u201cabomination\u201d to the Lord and should never be supported, followed, or given influence in our society. Yet, these same Christians joyfully give a man, who the Bible declares as a lying \u201cabomination,\u201d their praise, worship, and anointing as a healthy, worthy, divine leader. How can this possibly be? For it\u2019s certainly not biblical.\n\n\u201cLet me describe for you a worthless and a wicked man; first, he is a constant liar; he signals his true intentions to his friends with eyes and feet and fingers. He is always thinking up new schemes to swindle people. He stirs up trouble everywhere. But he will be destroyed suddenly, broken beyond hope of healing.\u201d Proverbs 6:12-16\n\nMost recently, Trump was caught lying to the American people about the severity of the  Covid-19 virus. Once again, declaring \u201cPeace, peace\u201d where there is no peace. In fact, long after he knew about the lethal severity of the virus he labeled it a \u201choax.\u201d Trump lied, 200,000 people have died. \n\nThe Bible clearly teaches, nothing of God ever comes from lying. \n\nI want a truthful President. I want leadership that places honesty over personal gain. I want to be led by people who believe that \u201cthe truth shall set you free,\u201d even if that truth is unpopular, difficult, or alarming. I want the Father of Lies not to be an object of political aspiration, but the subject of human and societal rejection. \n\nThat\u2019s why I can\u2019t vote for Trump, the Bible tells me so.",
         "Ok. My Christian church I grew up in has members that hate trump. A lot\u00a0",
         "Not always. Catholics believe you have to regularly go to confession for sins and a part of that process is suppose to making sure you make amends with anyone you wronged, and make a genuine attempt to better yourself. It's introspective too so it's not something the church tracks, you are obligated to be a better person. You can't just say a few words once and you are given a free pass.",

         "Enter, the immigrant, refugee, and the foreigner.\n\nNo one wants illegal immigration or open borders as a national policy, regardless of how conservative Evangelical Trump supporters label the position of progressives. Once again, Trump supporters seem to relish in creating issues that aren\u2019t real to deflect from addressing the ones that are.\n\nIf America is a Christian nation, what happens when immigration (illegal or not) happens? How, biblically, are we to treat the foreigners and immigrants among us, no matter how they arrive? What happens with refugees who come to our border? And, how are we to biblically treat those who seek asylum and new life within our country?\n\nThe Bible has crystal clear answers.\n\n\u201cDo not mistreat or oppress a foreigner, for you were foreigners in Egypt.\u201d Exodus 22:21\n\n\u201cWhen the alien resides with you in your land, you shall not oppress the alien. The alien who resides with you shall be to you as a citizen among you; you shall love the alien as yourself, for you were aliens in the land of Egypt:  I am the Lord your God.\u201d Leviticus 19:33-34\n\n\u201cWhen you reap the harvest of your land, do not reap to the very edges of your field or gather the gleanings of your harvest. Do not go over your vineyard a second time or pick up the grapes that have fallen. Leave them for the poor and the foreigner.\u201d Leviticus 19:9-10\n\n\u201cAs for the foreigner who does not belong to your people Israel but has come from a distant land because of your name\u2014 for they will hear of your great name and your mighty hand and your outstretched arm\u2014when they come and pray toward this temple, then hear from heaven, your dwelling place. Do whatever the foreigner asks of you, so that all the peoples of the earth may know your name and fear you, as do your own people Israel, and may know that this house I have built bears your Name.\u201d (1 Kings 8:41-44)\n\n\u201cThen I will draw near to you for judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers and against the adulterers and against those who swear falsely, and against those who oppress the wage earner in his wages, the widow and the orphan, and those who turn aside the alien and do not fear Me,\u201d says the Lord of hosts.\u201d Malachi 3:5\n\n\u201cFor the Lord your God\u2026loves the strangers, providing them food and clothing.  You shall also love the stranger, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt.\u201d Deuteronomy 10:18-19\n\n\u201cThe Lord watches over the strangers\u2026\u201d Psalm 146\n\n\u201cThe aliens shall be to you as citizens, and shall also be allotted an inheritance.\u201d Ezekiel 47:21\n\n\u201c\u2026I was a stranger and you welcomed me.\u201d Matthew 25:31 (Jesus speaking)\n\nNotice, Jesus doesn\u2019t say they, \u201ccaged me,\u201d \u201cabused me,\u201d \u201cneutered me,\u201d \u201cseparated me from family,\u201d \u201cstarved me,\u201d \u201cmade immigration nearly impossible for me,\u201d \u201cmocked me,\u201d \u201cslandered me,\u201d or \u201cmurdered me.\u201d  \n\nNo, he said of His true followers, they \u201cwelcomed\u201d me. \n\nSadly, this is not the policy of president Trump, nor the Republicans, nor the desires of many of his Christian supporters, even the ones who claim their faithfulness to the Bible and its infallible inerrancy. What God admonishes, they resist.  \n\nFor if you take the Scriptures seriously, the immigrant, the refugee, and the foreigner should not just be \u201cwelcomed\u201d with sacrificial hospitality, but \u201cwanted\u201d as God\u2019s own favored blessing. They should be lifted high among all others. They should be loved, protected, and provide for with the same passion we love, protect, and provide for ourselves. They are not to be objects of resentment, oppression, rejection, exploitation, or inconvenience. Rather, they should be honored as angels sent from above. They are us, and we are them. For in Christ, \u201cthere is neither Jew nor Gentile.\u201d\n\nI want a country in sync with God\u2019s heart for the immigrant, the foreigner, the alien, and refugee. I want a country in step with God\u2019s biblical, unconditional \u201cwelcome,\u201d \u201cwant,\u201d and generous care for those outside of our borders who desire to come, live, and find new life within us.  \n\nThat\u2019s why I can\u2019t vote for Trump, the Bible tells me so.",
         "But perhaps, most of all, loving your neighbor as yourself.\n\n\u201c\u2018Love your neighbor as yourself.\u2019 There is no commandment greater than these.\u201d Matthew 12:31\n\n\u201cBut I say, love your enemies! Pray for those who persecute you!\u201d Matthew 5:44\n\nThere is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear, because fear has to do with punishment. The one who fears is not made perfect in love. 1 John 4:18\n\nAs a former white, conservative Evangelical pastor of 20 years, I know deeply how the system works. I\u2019m not trying to slam the faith or the people within it, but the unbiblical evils must be chased out of the shadows, especially the hate of love among so many.\n\nFor most everything within white, conservative Evangelicalism isn\u2019t focused on having a neighbor to love, but rather based upon having an enemy that must be hated. Fear of these enemies is the ultimate motivator, not love. They will create it, fabricate it, and inflame it. For they are nothing without fear and the hate it awakens\u2026\n\nIf we love minorities as ourselves, they\u2019ll take over the church and society, and we\u2019ll lose our white church, white way of life, and white power. \n\nIf we love black people as ourselves with true equality, true police accountability, true legal fairness, true economic justice, and true opportunity, we\u2019ll have to admit our racism and white privilege, lose our white way of life, and surrender our white power.\n\nIf we love our wives as ourselves and remove the requirement that they must submit to us unquestionably, they\u2019ll take over the family, usurp male power, and run the church and society into the ground.\n\nIf we love the LGBTQ community as ourselves, our patriarchal power will be dismantled, God will punish our life, and all of white, male-driven, conservative Christianity will be flushed down the drain.\n\nIf we love special needs people as ourselves, we\u2019ll have to make an honored and equal place for them in society, overpowering our \u201cnormal\u201d lives with inconvenience. \n\nIf we love the least-of-these as ourselves with economic equality, free health care, free college, a living wage, social security, long-term care, and the removal of poverty, we won\u2019t be able to fund our industrial military complex and foster our diabolical economic system of socialism for top and capitalism for the bottom.  \n\nIf we love the environment as ourselves with significant building and development restrictions, environmental controls, and clean energy standards and investments, we won\u2019t be able to feed our insatiable appetites for economic and personal greed. \n\n\u201cDepart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink, I was a stranger and you did not invite me in, I needed clothes and you did not clothe me, I was sick and in prison and you did not look after me.\u2019 They also will answer, \u2018Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison, and did not help you?\u2019 He will reply, \u2018I tell you the truth, whatever you did not do for one of the least among you, you did not do for me.\u2019\u201d -Matthew 25:41-45\n\n\u201cHe who oppresses the poor to increase his wealth and he who gives gifts to the rich\u2013both come to poverty.\u201d -Proverbs 22:16\n\n\u201cNow this was the sin of your sister Sodom: She and her daughters were arrogant, overfed and unconcerned; they did not help the poor and needy.\u201d -Ezekiel 16:49\n\n\u201cThere is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.\u201d Galatians 3:28\n\n\u201cIf you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, \u201cLove your neighbor as yourself,\u201d you are doing right. But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers.\u201d James 2:8-9",
         "See, where God admonishes that our highest motivation should be the unconditional love and care for all of humanity equally, in contrast, there is truly no other fuel that drives the Evangelical Death Star than having enemies to fear, hate, marginalize, fight, and treat unequally.\n\nThis is why Trump has the addictive support and allegiance of most conservative Evangelicals. For the only thing they understand is fear, and Trump speaks their language like no other. He mocks special needs people, bullies his perceived enemies, embraces racism, fosters white supremacy, mistreats women, ignites division, worships greed, and loves himself above all things.\n\nBiblically, this is the ultimate blaspheme of the Spirit.\n\nTo see love as the enemy.\n\nTo see fear as the friend.\n\nTo see enemies as the goal.\n\nTo fight at all cost, with lies, violence, duplicity, and sin.\n\nTo see a white, conservative, Republican, American Jesus as the way, truth, and life.\n\nTo see white, conservative Evangelicalism as the Kingdom.\n\nI want a President with whom love is greater than fear. I want a country where to love all people equally is a friend and not an enemy. I want the character of a great person, a great society, a great economy, and a great nation to be defined by their love for all people equally, not fear nor hate. \n\nThat\u2019s why I can\u2019t vote for Trump, the Bible tells me so. \n\nGrace is brave. Be brave."

         "The low numbers are because Pennsylvania Democrats distrust the state\u2019s early-voting system, which is mail-in only and seems to potentially have been designed by their Republican legislature to make the Pennsylvania vote look more Republican than it is early in the evening (because mail-in votes have traditionally been used more by Democrats than Republicans). Therefore, many Pennsylvania Democrats have switched this year to voting in person on Election Day. Don\u2019t worry!",
         "The media spin is ignoring the difference in this election and 2020.\n\n2020: Dems encouraged everyone to vote by mail. Republicans said VBM was fraud and to vote on election day. This means many dems voted by mail, and few republicans did. \n\n2024: Dems don't encourage VBM in particular. Republicans try to push VBM hard in order to lock in votes in case Trump gets caught ~~sucking off a microphone hosting a nazi rally getting caught unable to open a garbage truck's door dancing for 39 minutes straight like a dementia patient insulting women, latinos, etc~~ doing something that would lose him votes. \n\nA 400k vote firewall in an environment like that is pretty good...

      "text": "I am a 23 year old man and I voted for Kamala Harris in Texas. I didn't think I would. If you asked me a month ago, I'd tell you I was holding my nose and voting for Trump. But I started getting second thoughts about it recently. \n\nI am not a Democrat or a Republican. I disagree with the Democrats (and Reddit) on a lot of issues. But this morning, I was thinking about the Supreme Court. I thought about Trump's actions following the 2020 election, and how the Supreme Court recently gave him immunity for what he did. I realized how much I despise the current Supreme Court for that and so many other things. It's more than just policy. I believe that this Supreme Court is flat out corrupt and I didn't want to reward them. \n\nI won't lie. I'm worried. I don't like the Biden-Harris economy and I want the 2019 economy back. But the economy has been getting a bit better lately, and I really don't like the current Supreme Court. Voting for Harris felt like voting against them. So that's what I did.\n\n**Edit:** Thanks for all the comments. I would like to note, I am well aware that Trump inherited a great situation from Obama and that Biden inherited a pandemic. What really frustrated me was how long the recovery took. I know it was a once in a lifetime event, but I thought we'd get over it faster than this. I could elaborate more on my exact thought process, but what matters is that I eventually decided to trust Harris to get us to where we need to be. \n\n",

And if he does that, Trump will have picked FIVE (5!!!) Supreme Court judges of the 9 member group. So literally over half of them. They're already given him immunity--imagine what else they would do for him and his autocratic, power-hungry allies with even more support.\n\nThat shit is absolutely terrifying--that honestly for me is one of the scariest parts of his candidacy.\n\nReally... thank you so much for seeing and understanding that it's not just about the one Presidential candidate themselves... it's about what they would do with their leadership that would affect the rest of the country.",

The most impactful economic policy is really decided by the non-partisan Fed board rates, or by other factors like the pandemic or migration in the case of home prices. It also can take a couple years for legislative policy to take effect (meaning the 2017-2019 economy was sort of set up by Obama's policies). Trump's biggest proposed policy, tariffs, would be a tax increase on everybody and a massive price increase throughout the supply chain, bad enough that it could lead to recession and would make the 2021-22 inflation look quaint.",

It's as if people who vote for trump don't listen to experts or facts at all even when they're barely listening to reason. The guy with dementia who didn't even know what NATO was when he got into office was never going to make you a millionaire, he doesn't have magical powers and neither does Biden.\n\nA President **can** *fix* things somewhat which is what Biden did but they do not control the economy, for the most part, that's going up and down no matter who is lucky / unlucky enough to be in office (depending on how the economy happens to be doing at the time). I kind of wish an economist would lose it and just start cursing up a storm at people who won't stop making the economy such a factor in their vote aside from some egregious circumstance like Trump's tariff obsession causing economic woes and Bush's dumb ass war on all the wrong countries.",

It's dampened by the aforementioned 'consequences of no economic growth'.\n\nReal strength is outwards and involves investing in people and their livelihoods; economically and emotionally. Fear is inwards and involves bowing to the worldly rich, building fences, regulating others especially the vulnerable, and an unwillingness to invest in regular people.

Economies are such complex systems, and our economy is tied together with other economies through trade, that most of what happens is out of the hands of our government. \n\nThere are a few things our government can do. They can raise or lower the national debt, which will affect the value of our currency. They can crack down on price gouging, or allow it. They can regulate Wall Street to allow or prevent actions that create instability in the market. And all those things only affect the economy years down the line. \n\nThe Fed, which is independent, can raise or lower interest rates. That usually has pretty immediate effects.\n\nThe president only has one thing he or she can do by themselves, and that is raise or lower tariffs.

         "The crazy thing about the economic recovery from covid is that the resulting inflation was a global issue, and we've actually bounced back faster from it than most other countries. The price issues you're seeing, especially at the grocery store, are now mostly the result of corporate greed. They know everyone needs food and we were willing to pay the high prices back when inflation was high, because we don't have a choice. We're still going to be shopping at grocery stores, and the cuts we'll have to make in order to be able to afford to eat will have to come from somewhere else. You're already seeing fast food prices start to drop again because a lot of people just cut that out entirely once it got too expensive. But groceries? They can screw us sideways and we'll still have to shop there. They used inflation as a convenient excuse to keep prices high, and people still think we have massive inflation as a result. Call me a socialist, but if a business is involved in selling something that is necessary for continued existence, the government should be able to step in and limit price-gouging. \n\nAlso, anyone concerned about the price of eggs in specific should know that there's a massive H5 bird flu outbreak. Started in wild birds, spread to poultry farms, and now the poultry farm workers are coming down with it. Not good. I shopped for eggs this weekend. It had been about a month since I'd bought some and the prices had gone from $4 a dozen to $6. I about lost my mind until I realized that there are a lot more factors at play than just corporate greed on that one.

I put on a funny voiceover for the 6th graders as they lined up to leave the class which just had some lame jokes (1 1/2 min long maybe). Principal walks through and waits and then asks me what I showed them as it was just the last few seconds. It literally was nothing \u201cpolitical\u201d at all. It was comedy. If you\u2019ve ever seen the football players voiceovers it was the same thing. Not a single thing about politics. But I didn\u2019t realize we had a \u201cno politics\u201d rule in place. Nothing was ever said to me as I wasn\u2019t a teacher/no curriculum and my Principal hired me and basically I never had contact with her unless I sought her out. \n\nI didn\u2019t get reprimanded or anything. Just told me no further political stuff. \n\nI personally recall talking about it in school growing up but I can see why they have steered away from it.

Had Harris been our president there would be a lot more living people.  We had to reuse masks because the supplies were not there and he did nothing to increase PPE (personal protection equipment) like masks, gowns, etc. I worked in a very wealthy Bay Area hospital system and we were given 1 N95 mask a week.

Most of them exited before me and none of us so much as had our temperature taken unlike SARS a decade before. \n3 weeks later I had to cut back my vacation home because Japan was about to close down and my wife and kids (and job) needed me.

The biggest one is that the voting machines used in my State are just fancy counting machines, and after the polls close and the last ballot is cast, I grab two other volunteers, they witness me break the seal on the password to transmit the scanned count, and they continue to witness me go through the process to transmit the count to the division of elections electronically. That's 95% or more of the votes for that precinct being submitted at once. That's happening across all precincts in the state, since we're all one time zone. \n\nThe other big jump is that absentee and mail-in ballots are scanned into the same type of machine and therefore submitted electronically after the scanning is complete. Depending on the state and how they handle these ballots, it could be one location with one machine, one location with multiple machines, or multiple locations with multiple machines. Each of these machines that transmits causes a sudden \"nearly instant\" change in vote count, and certain precincts are going to be significantly more red or blue, and absentee ballots tend to lean one way as well. \n\nDon't look at jumps in vote counts and say someone cheated - it just makes you look silly.",

So she could just lose to Trump here by a few less points? Florida isn't a swing state anymore, its best to just swallow that bitter pill and move on. It's what the GOP did after 2012 when Mitt Romney spent so much time and money thinking Colorado and Virginia were still swing states, they moved on in 2016 and didn't chase unicorns.

One of the statements I often make is that if you vote for Trump, you're either dumb or you're rich and you can check your bank account to figure out which one - he's been on the rich side of that. Voted for Trump in and 16 and 20. I found out over the weekend that he was NOT voting for Trump this year in Georgia and found out THIS MORNING that he actually voted for Harris. I know it's anecdotal but I'm hoping it's a sign of good things to come and that it provides some optimism for other people on here like your story did for me.",
         "That is BEAUTIFUL! And a testament to her social intelligence and empathy!",
         "This week my conservative inlaws told me that most of their house were voting Harris in PA. I am beyond elated, and seeing a ton of anecdotal evidence that this is happening a lot everywhere",
         "My bf\u2019s grandmother is 95 years old. She is lifelong Republican from LOUISIANA. She voted for Harris this year. \n\nHer words: I HATE that man. I despise him\n\n\ud83d\ude02",
         "I literally just texted my dad \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffc",
         "I got all ready to have the talk with my conservative religious sister in a swing state.  I said - I hope you will consider voting for Kamala\u2026.i was surprised when she immediately said - we already did.  A lot of people are fed up with him.",
         "Go, Auntie!",
         "That's amazing! I feel like some people are just waiting for the excuse or the permission to vote for who they know they should vote for.",
         "Thank you for this!",
         "Warm-and-fuzzy pilled",
         "I gave up on my asshole maggot brother, who has fully-embraced the hate.  He's only happiness comes from echoing sound bites from the glorious orange leader.  Anyone different, any variation from these views makes one a target.  It's scary.",
         "Give your aunt a hug for me! And keep these stories comin\u2019!",
         "Good job. Only family members can change someone's vote. I am reading many instances where a daughter convinced her father, her grandparents, aunts, etc., to change the vote because they trust her.\u00a0",
         "This is so sweet. I am happy she came around",
         "I did this and my sister now won't talk to me.\n\nI'm still glad I did though.",
         "Ok I know this is going to sound EXTREMELY corny but please hear me out:\n\nIf you watched The Walking Dead, remember when Rick/Team Family defeated Negan/The Saviors? Rick gave that whole big speech about working together and coming together and they accepted the Saviors into their lives (even though many didn\u2019t want to/were still villains)?\n\nThat\u2019s what has to happen with MAGA. We have to accept them - but educate them. They\u2019re still Americans by law. Even if I think they are traitors for voting for him, my opinion means nothing.",
         "Aww good on you. I hope she does it",
         "Oh wow, your aunt sounds absolutely amazing. Your story makes me teary eyed. Great job communicating so well and being able to move her to understand you more. This is awesome, OP \ud83d\udc99\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8",
         "My dad, a diehard Maga Republican and who adores Trump, told me that he voted for Kamala because he loves me and wanted me, his only daughter, to not be treated as a second class citizen. \n\nNo clue if he did or not. I'll never know if he actually did vote for her or just said it for brownie points. It's really sad to me that I can't trust my own dad about this :(\n\nI hope he did tho. I mean, CA was probably going to go for her anyway, but I really hope he actually told me the truth.\n\nMy brother is a lost cause tho. At least hopefully my mom's Kamala vote negated his Trump vote.",
         "Lots of stories like this. \n\n\ud83e\ude77\ud83c\udf0a",
         "Where are you people finding these wonderful open minded family members and can I join your family please?",
         "\"most likely\" ...",
         "> Likely change her vote. \n\nDid she?",
         "I am happy for you but my family will never be the same. I do t think I\u2019ll ever get them back and I\u2019ve made peace with it.",
         "You are optimistic, I will say that....",
         "I get an arguments with people on Reddit, who say that all Trump supporters are horrible evil racists. I know some really good people who support Trump. And it is hard for me to reconcile, but I believe they\u2019ve been brainwashed by right wing media to think that Democrats are literally demonic.",
         "That\u2019s amazing!!! \ud83d\udc99",
         "Honestly, they can rot for all i care. I draw the line at racism and sexual assault",
         "I\u2019m sorry \ud83d\udc99 holding space for you",
         "\ud83e\udec2 I also don\u2019t know if she actually did it. You are good to hope and to keep a line open to your dad. Let\u2019s see what happens.",
         "Just the fact that she acknowledged what I had said was enough for me and more meaningful than anything I\u2019d gotten from her in the last 8 years.",
         "I doubt that I\u2019ll ever know but even getting to be affirmed and acknowledged meant a lot and was way more than I was ever expecting.\n\nI did what I can. I\u2019m hoping to hear from her later today. We\u2019ll see.",
         "Better than believing my communities will give into hate \ud83d\udc99",
         "They have. And when they are starting to question things, you need to be ready to welcome them, not push them away."
