I was still a hardcore trump supporter, but last week I thought I would do some research. I remained blissfully unaware in previous years. I was taught by my family that the media lies and trump knows best.\n\nI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the pregnancy hormones or what, but I cried. Trump has gone off the rails. This isn\u2019t the future I want for my baby.\n\nIm voting for my baby. I\u2019m voting for my husband. I\u2019m voting for my rights.\n\nHarris/Walz 2024 \ud83d\udc99",

When I realized what the religious cult was doing to control me I also realized the Republican Party was doing the same thing. \n\nWhat helped me make sense of it all after I left are books by Steven Hassan, a cult expert.

If so, I\u2019d recommend a completely different set of things to watch. So, step 1) see what it is they actually care about, step 2) let us know and we can send you some links. Good luck!

After the remake made about PR, (SURE, not explicitly by Trump), the damage control was pitiful.  It\u2019s not the fact that Trump didn\u2019t say it, however, it\u2019s what he did not say to condemn the comedian\u2019s words.  Instead I\u2019m sure he laughed, along with millions of other racists.  \n\nI\u2019m tired of seeing the hate, tired of us not coming together as a country, I\u2019m tired seeing TRUMP MAGA flags flown from the back of trucks, with people acting as if he is the lord and savior.  It\u2019s a fucking cult. They blame the left for the blind leading the blind, calling us sheep when it\u2019s really the right and them placing blame on everyone else but themselves.

But she respects our constitution and respects election results. Trump embarrassed our entire country with his decision to resist the 2020 election results. It is the most baffling decision in presidential history. It is unparalleled by even Watergate. It is disqualifying.\n\nKamala Harris is not a \"moron\" who barely understands how the office of president works. I have confidence she knows more than Trump in this regard even though Trump has 4 years of experience \"doing\" the job. We need a president who isn't STUPID, so I am voting for HARRIS.\n\nBut my Republican party will be back. It will not go away forever. Remember, in American history, the Democratic party was once a much worse problem. Permanent political victory is a specter that we become radicals chasing. But for now: HARRIS and WALZ in '24",

There\u2019s no leadership in the Republican Party and it seems like a huge proportion of the electorate doesn\u2019t understand that fascism is bad.\n\nWe are in a very, very dangerous place and the power vacuum after Trump\u2019s exit is going to be dangerous too.",

I'd be happy to vote for Mitt Romney to save the country from Trump.",

Even though I am a liberal, I want to have conservatives in Congress that will work to pass legislation to help improve the country because there are some huge issues we are facing both internationally and domestically.

I imagine it was probably hard.\n\nI know if Trump was running against Mitt Romney or George Bush or Liz Cheney, I would have a very, very hard time voting. But at the end of the day, we can only solve big issues through a robust democracy, so that must be prioritized above all else. I would grit my teeth, but I'd vote for anyone over trump, even if I disagreed with them on many fundamentals.",
         "For the sake of our country, I do hope your Republican Party comes back. However, I\u2019m not so sure that will happen in the next 4 years. If (When) Trump loses, he\u2019s not going away. Trumpism is not going away. He\u2019s turned the base against all the traditional, old school republicans. \n\nThe cult/base is riled up.

         "Thank you for being a part of the solution! Much respect. We need to return to a state of normalcy and heal as a country. It won\u2019t happen overnight, but Harris being in office and maybe appointing a Republican to be in her cabinet will gradually make things better.",
         "Whenever a Republican puts country before party, an angel gets its wings. And I quote Victor Lazlo from \u201cCasablanca\u201d: \u201cWelcome back to the fight. This time I know our side will win.\u201d \n\nAnd I say, Thank you. With hot tears of hope streaming down my face.",

In the meantime, we Democrats are open to compromise in an effort to make our country stronger. \n\nYour party has proven to be full of cowards who cannot be trusted. It\u2019ll take a while to rebuild. Anyway, I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve seen the light and hope you\u2019ll continue to keep your options open as we heal.",

         "This is very true though. I\u2019m not sure how you keep both parties from going corrupt if they don\u2019t keep each other accountable. Sure, the Dems look amazing right now, but without a stable and sane GOP, there\u2019s nothing to hold them to it. We the voters need choice and competition!",

         "100%. They were bad pre 2015 too; not nearly as much but most of the same problems were all there. Obstructionism, appealing to fear/lies, fox news, etc.",
         "OK, but as much as I agree that it would be great to have two reasonable parties, racism has been a major factor in the Republican party for at least five decades, when the \"Dixiecrats\" moved over to the GOP (Southern strategy). Not that there aren't racist Democrats; naturally, there are. But as a party platform, racism has been far more of an open thing in the GOP for as long as I've been alive.",
         "this is exactly how i feel about it.  a romney republican i would vote for given that choice, because America\u2019s institutions are more important than a single president\u2019s ideas. \nwe can survive bad policy ideas. we may not survive someone who wants to burn the system to the ground  for their own power.",

That said, the difficulties in running elections in the country's biggest city shed some light. \n\nIt's sometimes really hard to find space to act as a poll site. The most common are local schools but not every community has a school nearby that works as a poll site. They need to be centrally located (to the districts around them), large enough to allow for the expected number of voters, ADA accessible, secure from violence or tampering, and usually hooked up for internet. \n\nFor this reason schools work really well (they tend to check all those boxes) but if you're far from a school, then hopefully there's a VFW, Masonic Temple, Knight of Columbus club house, rec center, or some other \"third space\" that the local Board of Elections can rent for the day.",

         "Keep in mind that in the US, people not just vote for the presidency, but there are multiple (sometimes up to 15-30 I believe) races and choices on their ballot. They vote for their national senator, their house representative for their congressional district, then also for the senate and house of their state, for local candidates in their county, sheriff, education board and sometimes multiple specific law initiatives or measures in some form of referendum. The ballot can be more than one page, and so it can be quite time consuming to fill it out entirely, especially if one is deciding on how to vote up to the moment they are in the voting booth.

Once you pinch through that Red wall of information that has been cultivated I think most people would be surprised to find how many people are willing to listen to common sense. Many of the people I grew up with just vote republican cause it\u2019s what they always have, and they don\u2019t pay attention to anything political.

      "text": "# \ud83d\udea8UPDATE 6:49 PM - They updated the reports once more! They increased the margin FURTHER 412,143!!!\ud83d\udea8\n\nHey all!\n\nChiming back in for ONE final time before election day tomorrow! This weekend saw a continuous rise in Pennsylvania Democrat mail-in ballot returns and have continued to outpace Republican returns with an increase of +9,000 ballots of separation from yesterday into today.\n\nAdditionally, we are seeing that almost a majority of Republican mail-in votes in PA are coming from those who voted in-person for previous elections, meaning that the \"red mirage\" *may* be heavily reduced - we won't know for sure until exit polling tomorrow / when the in-person numbers start coming in tomorrow night.\n\n**So far, Trump needs to find at least 409,000 more ballots tomorrow in Pennsylvania (I thoroughly believe this number will be close to 425,000 tomorrow).**\n\nThis is NOT the time to celebrate or to get overly confident. YOU. MUST. VOTE. No matter how long the lines are. No matter the rhetoric. No matter what happens. We stand in line until our votes are counted.\n\n# WE DO NOT STOP UNTIL WEDNESDAY. \ud83d\udc99\n\nI would just like to take the time and thank all the wonderful people I've interacted with over this election cycle. I know anxiety is at an all time high right now, but take a deep breath. Democracy will prevail as long as we vote. We got this.\n\n  \nMy Source is the Official PA Government Daily Mail-in Ballot Report available here -----> [Click Me](https://www.pa.gov/en/agencies/vote/elections/elections-data.html)\n\n*Last week --------------------------------------*\n\n>Sunday's Numbers (11/03)\n\n>Democrat Ballots - 973,363 Accepted\n\n>Republican Ballots - 572,481 Accepted\n\n>Margin not Counting Flipped Republicans / Independents - 400,882 Margin\n\n*>This week --------------------------------------*\n\n>Today's (Monday at 12:18pm EST) Numbers (11/04)  \n|Democrat Ballots - 1,014,744 Accepted  \nRepublican Ballots - 602,601 Accepted  \nMargin not Counting Flipped Republicans / Independents - ** 412,143 Margin** (+ 11,261 from Sunday)\n\n\n\nIf we take a look at where we started:\n\n>Dem Margin on Thurs 10/24/24 - +364,762 Ballots  \nDem Margin on Monday 10/28/24 - +379,486 Ballots (Increase of 14,724)  \n**Dem Margin on Monday 11/04/24 - +412,143 Ballots (Increase of 32,657)**\n",

It feels like the whole election hinges on that group.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0I\u00a0looked up final results exit poll Wikipedia. Looks like Democrat and Republican registered defectors were about the same % in 2020. 7-9% Independents were 52% Biden.\u00a0 No idea how those margins shook out in mail in though. Wondering if that info is out there.\u00a0\n\nThis is only like 25% of total votes in 2020 though. So you got possibly 5 million or more voters tomorrow. If Trump has that 60/40. He easily wins. 55/45 it\u2019s really close. We cant really use 2020 split of in person votes since it was so diffferent.\u00a0\n\nSo this is better than her being tied with mail in but I don\u2019t know if it gives me much confidence with 75% of votes yet to come.\u00a0",

If less Republicans are voting on Election Day, this means that there will be a lesser chance of a \"Red Mirage\" of which Drump could (once again) could use to stir his base.",

         "In 2020, Trump told Republicans to vote in person and not vote by mail. Conversely, Democrats followed health guidelines for COVID and predominantly voted by mail. But many states count in-person votes before they start counting previously-received mail-in votes. This resulted in the so-called \"red mirage\" where initial results showed a Trump win before they finished counting and showed a conclusive Biden win. (Many believe this red mirage outcome was actually Trump's objective, because it made it easier for him to claim the election was stolen.)\n\nThis year more Republicans are voting by mail and more Democrats are voting in person, so we expect this \"red mirage\" effect will be reduced or disappear. That means the early results are more likely to match the final true results.",

         "Republicans are doing mail in ballots at a higher rate this election than 2020, so it would make sense that the lead is smaller, but that then means less day of Republican votes and more votes they need to find because democratic performance has been better than expected",
         "> I realize that 2020 probably had more mail in votes than this year because of Covid,\n\nThis is exactly it. There has also been discussion that a lot of democrats may have decided to go back to election day voting because of the fuckery with the postal service, and the attacks on ballot boxes here in Washington and Oregon",
         "You should watch Simon Rosenbergs stuff on this! But tldr \n\n1. Lots of Dems are moving back to day of voting \n2. Repubs have been promoting mail in and early voting more so we expected more of them to do it \n3. Lots of the repub folks mailed in also voted in both elections prior which means they arnt generating as many new voters. It\u2019s more shifting folks who were gonna vote anyways to early voting methods",
         "Anecdotal but I'm in PA and all my dem friends are voting on election day, they felt it was such an important election they wanted the feeling of actually voting in the booth. I'm a dem too but me and my husband voted by mail early October. I personally think I would be too anxious to wait to vote on the day.",

         "I'd love to post a photo of her with her [,LA](https://upliftersranch.com/cdn/shop/files/CommaLATruckernavy.jpg?v=1722036558) hat on, but she's pretty shy and unlike the conservative majority of the Supreme Court I firmly believe in a woman's right to privacy.",
         "I don't think we can accurately predict that number. All we can go off of is looking at the results of 2020 through the lens of the 2022 midterm election. In 2022 midterms we saw that Dems were still showing up to vote in person. \n\n# If we go off of 2022 results we can see that...\n\n>5,368,021 people voted in PA (Counting ALL parties)  \nDemocrats Mail-In Ballots: 960,405 (Dems currently have 997,450)  \nRepublican Mail-In Ballots: 234,371 (R's currently have 587,546)  \n**Democrat Election Day Ballots: 1,759,658**  \n**Republican Election Day Ballots: 2,244,209**\n\nSo Dems are exceeding 2022 levels with low-percentage of day-of voters mailing in (meaning just as much if not more Dems will show up in-person tomorrow)\n\nRepublicans are exceeding mail-in A LOT. This isn't as good as it seems as a large majority of those mail-in votes are going to eat into their day-of totals because a large percentage of these mail-in ballots are coming from day-of voters. \n\nI think we will know instantly who the winner will be in PA once the first sets of numbers come in from Urban counties.",
         "1.7 million dems voted in person during a midterm senate race. The people that voted in 2020 are still voting, they\u2019re just changing how.",

         "Yep that's what I said. It sucks. I wish they could start counting earlier.",
         "Just with voting patterns. We saw that 2020 was an outlier because Covid and most Dems voted by mail because that\u2019s what was safest and most convenient to do. In 2024 things are so, so different. In 2022 was had 1.7 million people show up to vote in person. More people vote in Presidential elections.",
         "No problem pal!",
         "Thanks for the explanation. I was unaware of the changes",
         "I guess my concern is that the mail in ballots for Biden in 2020 were double what they\u2019ve received so far (assuming I\u2019m understanding the numbers right). Is there an indication that Dems are voting more in person, or is that just an assumption?",
         "I'm in PA and while me and my husband voted by mail, all the my other dem friends are voting on election day.",
         "I\u2019m in Maryland. Last presidential election I did mail in but this year chose to do in person because it just makes me feel like I actually did something. Can\u2019t explain it better than that.",
         "We voted and mailed ours, the day our ballots arrived.",
         "I'm a PA D voter who has voted by mail in the past but decided it was safer to do so in person this year. My boyfriend and my  mom have made the same choice and they were both mail-in voters in past elections as well.",
         "Yes! I voted last week!",

         "There was a pandemic, it\u2019s logical the people who took the pandemic seriously would try to vote early and avoid crowds.",
         "I can say on a personal level, I know people who were mail in voters and are now voting in person. I can\u2019t say what I\u2019ve seen in the data would prove any of that mostly because I have not dug that deep into it, but I assume from the raw numbers that it\u2019s going to be a lean R split on Election Day but not as massive as 2020",
         "You can\u2019t compare 2020 for this exact reason. The pandemic loosened mail in voting rules through out much of the nation. \n\nThe source for the data doesn\u2019t tell us who anyone voted for either.\n\nI\u2019d find it more likely that Republicans voting for Harris would mail-in/early vote before MAGAs would vote that way for Trump.",
         "Also, for now, according to our campaign, only 16% of democrats that had voted in person in 2020 voted early this cycle. While 84% of republicans that had voted in person on election date in 2020 have voted early this year.\nThe analysys suggests that their voters just voted early, no massuve amount of new votes for them are appearing.",
         "As did we!",
         "I felt the same and that was my plan but I started getting way too anxious that like, I'd fall into a coma and not be able to vote. Or something less dramatic. It was getting intense so I just sent in my ballot.",

Harris' campaign is heavily focused on women's rights, and flowers have a potential double-meaning: Flowers are used metaphorically to refer to wombs (budding flowers specifically in regards to gestation), and Kamala means lotus in Sanskrit, lotuses are a flower that grows in water, water of the womb and stuff in addition to Harris' first name\n\n\nOr maybe I'm reading too far into it",

She's distancing herself from the sinking ship to avoid going down with him. She knows she has absolutely nothing to gain by remaining associated with him, and everything to lose. She's extremely shrewd and conniving and is smarter than her father and two brothers put together, even before Donald's dementia. She's taking care of #1 just like the very few smart members of her family did. It's entirely self-serving, and if that happens to serve other people, well it's nice but not intended.

He's said she is very smart\u2026then again that could've easily been how he kept her quiet.

Might sound like splitting hairs, but there's a real difference.\n\nI'm actually even somewhat hopeful of a \"reverse 2016\" where the polls and everyone thinks it's a coin toss race, but she runs up the score with a decisive, irrefutable landslide win.\n\nAnd this feeling isn't totally without evidence.  The most respected pollster in the country, Ann Selzer has Harris up by 3 in Iowa.  She's the real deal, and I trust her enough to suspect that this might be a bellwether indicating a dramatic shift in late-deciding voters that also translates to decisive wins in other midwestern states with similar demographics like Wisconsin and Michigan.\n\nSelzer got onto my radar in 2020 when it looked like Iowa's senate race between Joni Ernst and Theresa Greenfield was neck and neck, with Greenfield mostly ahead in the polls.  The Sunday before the election, the Selzer poll dropped and put Ernst at +4, bucking the trend of the rest of the polls.  I naively hoped this outlier poll was wrong, but she was right, as Ernst won by +5 or +6, I can't remember now.\n\nBut I'm optimistic.  I'll never forget that feeling in 2016 when they called the race for Trump and I'll be crushed if he wins again, but I feel like I'm more prepared than last time to handle it.

         "I hate that this election is turning out to be men vs women, but I guess we play the game in front of us. \n\nMy husband also doubles my vote. We didn't vote identically (for some local races we think similarly, but ultimately fell on opposite sides of an imaginary line), but for president? Hell yes.",
         "I first read this as the husband cast 2 votes for Trump lmao.",
         "So, I figured this would be as good a place as any to post this comment.\n\nI'm an alienated ex-Republican who has come around to voting for Harris this time, because she's a good human being, and we need to turn the page on the civic cancer that is Trump. \n\nBut, of the two of us, I, the man, tend to be the more liberal. My wife is more conservative. Granted, she's never been a fan of Trump, but I just figured she'd be the kind to hold her nose and vote for him anyway. You know, one of those types.\n\nSo imagine my surprise when we had a few minutes to discuss the election Saturday morning. Sitting in the car, I said that in this election, Harris is the only choice for civic-minded Americans who care about democracy, institutions, and the rule of law. My wife said, \"Yep. Me too. I'm in for Harris.\" I was FLOORED. And she went even further, on the topic of abortion, basically saying that while she would not encourage it, and doesn't think it's ever a good outcome, \"at the end of the day, that's not my choice to make for her. It's between she and God.\" This, coming from a quiet, faithful evangelical Christian who would, by all outward appearances, seem to be your typical Trump voter.\n\nBoth of us voted for McCain and Romney back in the day. But enough is enough. The GOP has alienated people like us, and they will reap the whirlwind tomorrow. That's two votes that would've been a lock for the GOP in 2012 that will go to Team Blue this time. I know we're in a very red state. But, extrapolate our situation to the swing states, and how many more cases like ours are we talking? Especially when it comes to Dobbs. Again, I think there are millions of women who may publicly code as pro-life, but inside, they have a more nuanced view.",

Thing is I don't actually know for sure how she voted and it doesn't matter. (She doesn't like Trump at all)\n\nShe also is getting me to eat my veggies and making sure I go to doctor appointments. It's like she wants to keep me around. But ultimately we are our own people and I am glad she is in my life. \n\nThing is as a young man, if I knew the ladies were all voting democrat I probably would have been too. I don't get the incels that want the Trump and Vance vision of America and marriage. I prefer a partner who wants to be with me, and actually carries on a real conversation. That's the thing it's a partnership it has to be. \n\nDo I always want to eat a dam salad, no I want pizza and wings, but if she makes me a salad I'll eat it.

The world is complex.",

We looked the candidates up and one had endorsements from 2020 election-deniers, which was a very obvious giveaway, while the other wanted to form a mental health crisis intervention unit. Made the choice far too easy. I\u2019m in a red county in a blue battleground state so I don\u2019t have any illusions here that my candidate will win, but it was eye opening and really displayed how important ALL races, from the Presidency to our critical local positions, are in the democratic process.",

Trump campaign is very please and some democratic operatives see his impact. \n\nFrom [this](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/what-elon-musk-is-doing-pennsylvania-trump.html):\n\n> Trippi pointed out not only that Musk has enormous personal reach, which he uses to amplify positive messages about Trump and spread negative ones (including some falsehoods) about Democrats \u2014 but also that the X platform itself now compounds those effects. Anyone who clicks on the algorithmically controlled \u201cFor You\u201d tab on the site is likely to see multiple posts from Musk himself, accompanied by viral posts that skew Trumpian (for instance, clips depicting a country overrun by migrants and criminals)\n>\n> Trump-campaign officials have looked on with amazement as messages that they struggled to call attention to, such as J.D. Vance\u2019s visit to the border, suddenly go megaviral online thanks to Musk\u2019s boost. The help is even more appreciated, they say, since under the previous regime of the website, many conservatives felt that their voices were being censored or suppressed.\n>\n> \u201cIt\u2019s amazing,\u201d said one Republican operative close to Trump. \u201cHe\u2019s engaging in politics in a way that no one in that kind of position has really done before, and he is hitting all of the pro-Trump and anti-Kamala notes you could ask for and making things go viral left and right. It\u2019s not even that he is the owner of the site; it\u2019s the fact that he is engaging in a way he never did. Twitter, or X, or whatever you call it, is still the place where media narratives are created on both sides of the aisle. Twelve percent of the U.S. population is on Twitter, and that includes top Republican and Democratic operatives.\u201d\n>\n>...\n> One Trump campaign official described Musk as being like Mike Lindell, the MyPillow magnate who was a relentless promotor of Trump in 2020 \u2014 except that Musk is someone \u201cwith real money.\u201d\n>\n> \u201cWe just stand back and marvel.

Which is weird and shows something pollsters are doing this year is different than previous years. That at least substantiates the claim that they are \u201cherding\u201d the data, meaning they are essentially tweaking the results to look more like other polls out there to avoid outliers.\n\nEdit: [Apparently, it was an article, and not a paper.](https://ash.harvard.edu/articles/using-ai-for-political-polling/) It still seems plausible to me that they might already be using techniques like this.",

It\u2019s a whole other beast to use generative AI that\u2019s prone to \u201challucinations.\u201d",

         "Generative AI employs neural networks in a way that shouldn\u2019t be used in any serious data analysis. They are just word (image/video/etc) calculators that predict the next probable word based on the input text and the previously generated words. It\u2019s great at mimicking speech, and the data sets they are trained on have a lot of information to draw from, so there\u2019s a tendency to provide good information, but they also frequently \u201challucinate\u201d and confidently provide inaccurate information. Look at Google\u2019s Gemini telling people they should use glue to get the cheese to stop sliding off their pizza or telling people how many rocks you should eat in a day.\n\nModels that are trained specifically on polling data, with accurate labels can be useful in analyzing polls. But large language models are ridiculous to use for this. It\u2019s not a matter of scale, because generative ai isn\u2019t just bigger neural networks, it would be the complete wrong application of the technology.\n\nAlso, totally agree that it\u2019s a bit moot to argue at this point, because there\u2019s not actual evidence. All I\u2019m saying is that if Harris wins in a landslide, and we start digging into why the polls were so off, and it came out that one of the reasons was that *some* pollsters incorporated large language models (like chatGPT) to make up for the fact that it\u2019s been increasingly difficult to get good data from the under 30 crowd, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised. It\u2019s been a year where CEOs and investors have wanted generative ai shoehorned into everything without an understanding of what the technology actually is and what its limitations are.",
         "\ud83c\udfc6",
         "I think for lxms (x because the models are taking in more modalities than just language now) are a relatively novel tool that yes a lot of industries are playing around with, but for the reasons you\u2019re describing I\u2019d be very surprised if a language model like chatgpt was being used seriously for data analysis at any kind of professional level, not least of all because the process by which it arrives at conclusions is very hard to interrogate. \n\nI do agree that pollsters are in a bit of a disarray given that their modelling is predicated on norms that have been distorted by this surreal political decade."

That base, at that time, was made up of a large scoop of people who were so disaffected by the political process and candidates that they were ready to vote for ANY change, on top of a base of racists and morons who couldn't tell the difference between what they watch on TV and reality.  The result was the razor thin victory in 2016, and the chaos which ensued.\n\nEasily forgotten here in 2024 is the first, MOST STUNNING reaction to Trump's inauguration was on January 21, 2017.  At least half a million women gathered in D.C. along with women all over the world (there were a couple of dozen expat women who met up at a bar here in BKK in solidarity) marched together that day.  \n\nWhen history looks back, this event will mark the beginning of the end for Trump and the entire theocratic agenda that Republicans have exploited to gain national power as a minority party.  During his administration, Trump was revealed to be the worst sort of misogynist, and also willing to use his power to repress women in any way possible.  This didn't go unnoticed.\n\nThen came Dobbs.. and we all know the rest. Democrats have not lost an election of any consequence since Dobbs in red and blue states.\n\nTomorrow, Trump will find out that his radicalized army from 2016 has had it's scoop removed and only the idiots and racists(same thing?) remain.  And, in spite of his delusions, it's nothing like 50% of our electorate.\n\nBUT, women are more than 50% of the electorate, and they are showing up in record numbers.  Just ask Ann Selzer.  And, old folks like me, who remember the days of women living in a world of highly restricted rights, and watched women claw their way forward to now where they lead us, only to watch this hatred and meanness on the Republican side rip those rights away, are fired up.  \n\nTrump is about to learn that 2016 American women are NOT 2024 American women.   Me too, Dobbs, and the wave of women moving into offices all over the country have created  a confident, really pissed off, majority of voters.\n\nSo, as he's led off to prison, he should bear in mind that underestimating women is what put him in clothes the same color as his face.\n\n\n\nLet's go\n\n ",

It's been shocking for me, and I assume many others, to realize just how sexist and racist some of our fellow Americans really are, but I get it now. They are there and they aren't going anywhere.\n\nStill. The man has done zero to gain any new voters. Everything he's done since losing in 2020 counts against him. Two impeachments. Criminal schemes to over throw democracy, including a violent insurrection. Dozens of felony convictions. A court finds him a sexual abuser. Women are beyond pissed about Roe.

         "There's no doubt in my mind that Nikki Haley wants Harris to win. Not because she thinks Harris would be better for the country, but because a crushing defeat of trump gives her the best in as The heir apparent. She can argue that Trump lost a bunch of her voters that would have voted for her and conservative principles if they had nominated her. I don't really know how it's going to work because at this point it seems like a lot of mega would rather lose than nominate anybody other than Trump or Trump endorsed candidate, but I definitely think this is what Haley's thought process is.  \n  \nOf course she can't actually endorse Harris as that would alienate her permanently from the Republican base",

But she can speak in complete sentences and can pretend to be the \u201cchange\u201d candidate, and low-information voters will buy it. Project 2025 is not dead at all, just potentially postponed. Haley will do a better job of hiding Project 2029.",

         "If Trump loses, Republicans are in serious trouble. \n\n1. Trump won't give a a damn about anything political other than his own revenge. That may work when you're the defacto leader of your party, but it's only a liability when there is new blood in charge.\n\n2. Trump will burn the party down if anyone approaches his popularity, if they cross his interests, or does not praise the king. Problem here is that if the king is unpopular, then any heir apparent will be even more so. \n\n3. Trump has pushed the party into a single identity: grievance. While this was building before Trump, it is the only thing the party had left. There is no coherent policy on anything. In fact, what few factions remain are in direct confrontation : libertarian vs authoritarian, pro Ukrainian vs pro Russia. Pro business vs anti-globalization. And we know the one policy they used to agree on: pro life, it's now an electoral loser.\n\nIf Hailey wants to build a new party coalition, she has a lot of work cut out for her.",
         "Haley has no courage.    If she did, she would have spoken up after the primaries and suggested her people NOT vote for trump.   Her giving approval to him shows a not dependable character.\n\nWhen Mitch McConnell and Lindsay Gayham have more courage, it is pretty fricken bad!",

         "Unironically, I want to see trump run in 2028 lmfao. \n\nNo one is capable of sustaining any growth or support after losing the popular vote 3 times in a row.",
         "I think it's less selfish than \"Nikki Haley wants to be the heir.\" A lot of old-school Republicans are sick of Trump's antics. They feel like their party has been hijacked. If Harris has a resounding win tomorrow you can bet that disaffected Republicans are going to want to strike while the iron is hot, if for no other reason than to avoid another prolonged period of Trump sucking all of the air out of the room (and donations out of the coffers) as he insists that he won the election.",

         "Should give Haley some more credit; there's a lot of air between her and Trump on policy.\n\nShe's not going to use the military to deport immigrants. She's not going to do blanket tariffs on everything. She's not going to just hand Ukraine to Russia.\n\nShe's just going to do normal Republican things, like ban abortion, cut taxes for the wealthy, blow up the deficit, and then say we need to cut Social Security because we have too much debt.",
         "She's not proposing tariffs though. That is at least one meaningful difference.",
         "People can still use her endless support for him and his policies against her though. Every republican supporting him hard and loud right now is forever tainted.\n\nIf the GOP suffers a huge defeat and has to reconstruct itself we may find it circling around a new candidate that hasn't been in the news at all.",

The reason why I think Haley specifically is being selfish and trying to position herself as heir is she's simultaneously criticizing the Trump strategy but also endorsing him. She's positioning herself to say \"I endorsed Trump because of his policies but I knew his strategy sucked and that's why he lost, I can win with the same policies but better strategy\".",
         "My point is that for her play to work, she needs to keep up a front of Trump support as to not alienate the MAGA base she hopes to inherit in the future. My belief that she wants Harris to win isn't because I think she cares about the danger of Trump, it's a political calculation about her own future",

Jr won\u2019t have that same kind of \u201cfame\u201d and thus won\u2019t be able to have the same kind of grasp on the base.",

There's a small town nearby that's surrounded by farms and orchards, typically what you'd consider red country. About a month ago I went up there to go apple picking and I was blown away to see how many Harris/Walz signs there were. They probably outnumbered the Trump signs 4-1. I know in NY it doesn't mean a whole lot but if there's surprises like that in other states, it gives me a glimmer of hope.",

More people in the neighborhood did the same, there are still Trump signs, but significantly less than the last two elections and I haven\u2019t actually counted but I think there might be more Harris signs around me.",
         "Mhm, I feel similarly in a way, yes there are still many more MAGA voters than Harris at the polls when I was there (not Matthews, a smaller town, all MAGA afaik) but, there *have* been less Trump signs over the past few months which is promising. People are afraid, and rightly so, I've been told some egregious and nasty stuff in regards to votes from folks, but, people still get out and vote, and still some for Harris hopefully! But yeah, I have some hope but, I'm scared haha",
