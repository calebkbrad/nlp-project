I asked him not to vote republican just because there's an R next to it and asked him to vote for his daughters future. I told him about Roe vs. Wade and several other issues he had no idea about. He decided not to vote, which is sad in a way, but it's one less vote for Trump, so I suppose it's a win. After talking to him, I realized a lot of trumps votes are going to be from uninformed people who don't keep up but vote because there is an R, and they were raised Republican. I get it because I was like this, too, in my twenties, but something needs to change. We need something to help inform the masses. Most don't watch news unless it's Fox, and it's hard to trust most social media news. In fact, if it wasn't for my son's, I'd still be an uninformed Republican as well.",

Had Harris been our president there would be a lot more living people.  We had to reuse masks because the supplies were not there and he did nothing to increase PPE (personal protection equipment) like masks, gowns, etc. I worked in a very wealthy Bay Area hospital system and we were given 1 N95 mask a week. It was pure hell being a nurse at that time and he did absolutely nothing to help solve very solvable problems.

Most of them exited before me and none of us so much as had our temperature taken unlike SARS a decade before. \n3 weeks later I had to cut back my vacation home because Japan was about to close down and my wife and kids (and job) needed me. But not before the shit show of ages spun up over here where just getting water and toilet paper involved heated negotiations with other shoppers. \n\nAnd that was just the beginning to an awful almost 2 years of that shitty timeline for me.

But I started getting second thoughts about it recently. \n\nI am not a Democrat or a Republican. I disagree with the Democrats (and Reddit) on a lot of issues. But this morning, I was thinking about the Supreme Court. I thought about Trump's actions following the 2020 election, and how the Supreme Court recently gave him immunity for what he did. Then I realized how much I dislike the current Supreme Court for that and so many other things. It's more than just policy. I believe that this Supreme Court is flat out corrupt and I didn't want to reward them. \n\nI won't lie. I'm worried. I don't like the Biden-Harris economy and I want the 2019 economy back. But the economy has been getting a bit better lately, and I really don't like the current Supreme Court. Voting for Harris felt like voting against them. So that's what I did. ",

         "Thank you!\n\nIf Trump wins, the oldest (and most extreme) 2 judges of the Supreme Court, Alito and Thomas, would likely retire during his next term, so Trump could install 2 more extreme judges that would be much younger (so they would stay on the court longer). And if he does that, Trump will have picked FIVE (5!!!) Supreme Court judges of the 9 member group. So literally over half of them. They're already given him immunity--imagine what else they would do for him and his autocratic, power-hungry allies with even more support.\n\nThat shit is absolutely terrifying--that honestly for me is one of the scariest parts of his candidacy.\n\nReally... thank you so much for seeing and understanding that it's not just about the one Presidential candidate themselves... it's about what they would do with their leadership that would affect the rest of the country.",

         "As I think of it: Trump is off the rails, and there are no guardrails with the SCOTUS decision. Makes me think America will derail with Trump as president.\n\nAlso, a little secret about economics. The most impactful economic policy is really decided by the non-partisan Fed board rates, or by other factors like the pandemic or migration in the case of home prices. It also can take a couple years for legislative policy to take effect (meaning the 2017-2019 economy was sort of set up by Obama's policies). Trump's biggest proposed policy, tariffs, would be a tax increase on everybody and a massive price increase throughout the supply chain, bad enough that it could lead to recession and would make the 2021-22 inflation look quaint.",

The Fed has stopped inflation caused by Covid, & the overall economy is looking much better than people were projected 1.5 years ago at the start of the inflation surge.\n\nHarris/Walz will consistently choose thoughtful policy with working folks in mind.

But especially in his false allegations of fraud in 2020. \n\nWhich was, quite simply, a blatant lie made to hold on to power. If we look at the facts, the election boards and state legislature of Arizona and Georgia, the two states he pushed hard with the fraud allegations, were Republican. Bill Barr was a Republican and the senior member of his old Administration. Mike Pence was his Vice President. General Mark Milley is a Republican and was his Military Chief of Staff and he's called Trump a fascist. The Federal Elections Commission that worked under Trump found no fraud. Fox News was too damn scared to fight Dominion on election lies so they settled out for almost a billion dollars without a fight. Trump took this lie to Judges, some of which he appointed and others were registered Republican and Independent, and they found no fraud after reviewing legal cases brought forth by the Trump campaign and administration. \n\nThis lie was so big, he tried a coup on January 6 when he exhausted all of his legal options. The fact that so many of his supporters still push this lie today shows that they follow this essential command.",

It's struggle to apply compassion, for example, to an external person or group....but when the issue is suddenly *affecting YOU directly*, you suddenly see the light. Because nothing about the issues has changed in the past couple years, just your own personal circumstance did. \n\nI think this is part of why gay rights became such a broadly accepted issue.  Lots of conservatives found out they had gay people in their families, or as close friends.  Suddenly, gay rights wasn't some abstract concept, it affected conservatives on a personal level...and gay rights suddenly didn't seem so bad anymore, because they wanted their son/cousin/neighbor to have them.",

He has managed to convince a significant portion of the population to ignore their senses, to ignore common sense, to ignore *anything* other than what he says is true. \n\nIf you listen to Trump, the left is to blame for all the world's problems. The political divide that we face today, that is the fault of the left. I don't know how old you are, but I can assure you that historically, despite rhetoric, prior to Trump, politics had limits. Trump is the one who destroyed those limits. Trump is the one who mocked a disabled reporter. Trump is the one who attacked a gold star family. Trump is the one who called Mexicans rapists. Over and over again.\n\nAnd, yes, the dems have responded in kind. Hillary called his supporters \"deplorables\" and Biden called them \"garbage\".

         "If historical political pendulum swings still work as usual, Trumps voter base has only shrunk since his peak in 2016, which he only really won because of about 40,000 votes in a few states.

         "Significantly more people. I always go around the same time so I feel safe in saying that at least at that time the turnout was like triple what it would normally be. I\u2019m sure that doesn\u2019t hold all day. But very interesting data point",

         "I'm just thankful the Republicans are so loud-mouthed about everything. I honestly think the abortion stuff finally pushed a lot of women over the edge. Trump bragged about sexually assaulting women before 2016 and still won. \n\nBut telling someone what they can/can't do with their own body? There are a significant number of unreligious Republican women out there where this crossed the line. I think the Republicans know this too, as seen by Trump and Vance both trying to walk-back the party's stance. \n\nI think most people would be surprised to learn that a lot of Republicans only identify as Republican because they think Republicans are the party of the rich and Democrats represents poor people. All their stances on social issues are aligned with Dems. The decades of propaganda have convinced millions of low-information Americans that Republicans make you richer and Democrats take your money for welfare. \"I am rich (or want to be), so therefore I'm a Republican.\"\n\nThe Dobbs/abortion issue however is one of those things where you're directly stripping a right away from someone that has been there for decades. Something like this is powerful enough for people to put their party affiliation aside and not vote out of disgust. \n\nIf the Dems suddenly pushed through a decision that men can't have shoulder-length hair (for example), it would be the same reaction I think. Even though there are millions and millions of men that don't and never will have longer hair, there'd be a fair number of Dems that didn't vote (or flipped to the other party) just because the principle of the thing. \n\nThey thought the Dobbs decision was going to be a boost going into this election and empower their base or something. I think if they just waited until Trump won in 2024 to push this stuff through we'd have a much much scarier situation.",

They\u2019d continue to make incremental changes as red meat for their base but never actually overturn it. \n\nI underestimated how stupid they were.",
         "On average early vote was 55% women vs 45% men, so men have a lot of catching up to do if Trump is to have a chance. It's an even larger gap than that in PA. We shall see, but if men aren't turning out at least 6% to 8% more than women today then I would be extraordinarily surprised by a Trump win. That could happen, but we shall see.",

         "They say that 2016 had terrible turnout, which was about 58%. Yet 2020 turnout was record breaking and it was 67%. America seems to have significant turnout problem. If I was in a tram and it had 9% more passengers than usual, I'd barely register it. With these facts, I tend to be bummed out that at the end of the day, the turnout isn't 90% or so. With so many stories coming out that the turnout is double of the last time and stuff like that.",

         "100%. They were bad pre 2015 too; not nearly as much but most of the same problems were all there. Obstructionism, appealing to fear/lies, fox news, etc.",
         "The cravenness of the Republican \u201cleadership\u201d since Trump was elected has been stunning. I\u2019m not a young person, technically Independent, definitely not a Dem activist, but I\u2019ve probably have ended up supporting Dem candidates most all of the time due to being much more aligned on the major issues. Still, in years past, I would usually give Republican candidates a look, particularly in statewide races. TBH, I even seriously considered voting for Trump in \u201816, not really on the issues then, but I struggled with the idea that after McConnell and the rest gave Obama such a hard time, they were SO obstructionist, I feared that the Clinton \u201cbaggage\u201d would just stall the country in any kind of signifiant legislative progress for another 4 years. There were probably even a whole day or two where I might have said I was gonna vote for Trump, some weeks before the election. I\u2019d been angry at him when he first came to prominence with his birther bullshit, I never appreciated his schtick, but I imagined holding my nose and voting for him hoping the country could move forward. Still, by a month or so before the election I\u2019d heard enough from him that I quickly changed my mind. I saw how flawed his character is, how ignorant the man was yet still aspired to the highest office. So, I couldn\u2019t bring myself to do it and I was WAY more comfortable voting for Hillary. This is a long way to say that I\u2019m not a knee-jerk partisan. So, I have been terribly disappointed in how the Republican party allowed this all to happen. The massive hypocrisy and abasement on the part of the likes of Rubio, Cruz, McConnell, McCarthy, etc., the so-called \u201cleadership.\u201d And now we have JD Vance, the worst kind of political opportunist. The worst thing is that these people have allowed our institutions to fail us, they failed to live up to their constitutional responsibility. The founders probably couldn\u2019t imagine serious people in high office being so  utterly irresponsible. The failure of the 2nd impeachment was the nadir of this failure. From Mitt Romney\u2019s telling, it may well be that several Senators that otherwise would have voted to convict, vote for acquittal out of literal fear for their own safety and that of their families. And that was essentially a fear of the same fascist reaction of retribution that hangs over us all today, as we await the results of this election.",

         "This is very true though. I\u2019m not sure how you keep both parties from going corrupt if they don\u2019t keep each other accountable. Sure, the Dems look amazing right now, but without a stable and sane GOP, there\u2019s nothing to hold them to it. We the voters need choice and competition!",
         "The last time the Democrats completely fell apart was the election of 1860. That did not end well. \n\nEarlier the country mostly did okay (apart from breaking treaties and ethnic cleansing Native Americans) in the period when the former Federalists were figuring out how to make a viable Whig alternative to the Democratic-Republicans and the succeeding Jacksonian populist Democrats. \n\nParty realignment is fairly frequent in American politics. One-party government at all levels is much more unusual.",

Not that there aren't racist Democrats; naturally, there are. But as a party platform, racism has been far more of an open thing in the GOP for as long as I've been alive.",
         "this is exactly how i feel about it.  a romney republican i would vote for given that choice, because America\u2019s institutions are more important than a single president\u2019s ideas. \nwe can survive bad policy ideas. we may not survive someone who wants to burn the system to the ground  for their own power.",

Obama was incredibly popular and Bush was universally disliked (and the recession started a month or two before the election) so I think people were ready for change (see what I did?). McCain was always a longshot in 2008. He picked Palin because he was losing and needed a gamechanger. Another person considered for his VP pick was Joe Lieberman (a Democrat). I do wonder what would have happened had he done a cross-party ticket.",
         "Thinking about the inverse of the situation we're in is super funny to me.\n\nImagine if there were a Democratic candidate, \"Tom\" and they pick a nut job for VP, \"Hank\", that has some extreme and questionable authoritarian views, but is progressive nonetheless, and was chosen in an effort to gain more support of progressives. This strategy ends up failing and Tom/Hank lose the election. Those that were given a voice now no longer have it and are super pissed, so they go full extreme conspiracy butthurt mode and before you know it, in the next election cycle the country is attempting to elect an actual communist as a Democratic candidate that is very overtly attempting to consolidate power, eliminate rivals, stack loyalists, the whole 9 yards, but the brainwashed that gawk over this commie don't see it. All of us have to then vote Republican to save our country's democracy and free market system and such.\n\nLike, WHAT THE FUCK TIMELINE IS THAT, MAN!? LMAO. It's like some Cold War propaganda movie or something. Wild. Anyways, I thought I'd share this, as I think it puts into perspective just how big of a deal defeating Trump is in our nation's history. This is a very important timeline, and our children/grandchildren will ask to interview us about how it was like living in these times."

      "text": "I doubt this will be seen by many but I felt like adding my voice to the din of Harris support just to be heard.\n\nI voted last week by mail and I proudly chose Harris--for literally one reason even though I like her for others.\n\nI voted because of women's reproductive rights.\n\nMy dad was a staunch Republican growing up. He proudly stood for all the things the party claims to stand for: family, values, and morals. He was enraged by Clinton's blow job and he was thrilled when Bush won. He was an extremely proud Christian who believed in saving yourself for marriage.\n\nHe didn't practice what he preached, though. He moralized and pontificated on purity while sexually abusing me, physically hitting me, and verbally assaulting me almost every day I was with him. He choked both of his ex-wives and me before we left. He threatened to kill me weekly if I didn't do exactly what he said and it only got worse as I got older. We read the Drudge Report daily online, we listened to Limbaugh on long car rides in which he ranted for hours about immigrants, and I wasn't allowed to think about any issue unless I parroted his opinion back to him in his exact words. All women existed for was to serve men according to my dad and for years I believed him.\n\nIt was not until the police removed me in 9th grade that I began to actually truly realize how wrong he was--and I lived in one of the most progressive states in the country, yet was subjected to this level of \"brainwashing.\"\n\nThis is why I am a single issue voter now in my mid-30s. When I voted for Harris this election cycle, what I really voted for was abortion because I don't want another vulnerable girl somewhere to lose the rights I had which thankfully I didn't need to use. \n\n  \nAdmittedly, too, I love the idea of my estranged father losing his mind over a woman commander in chief too. \ud83e\udee1\n\n  \n",

But when people come from many different backgrounds, and they discuss their ideas respectfully, you really do learn a lot.\n\nIf we want America to work like that, we need to support people who disagree respectfully, and oppose anyone that tries to tear the country apart.",
         "Same here! My whole family is republican so I grew up listening to Rush Limbaugh and Laura Schlessinger lol Was super indoctrinated and believed tons of the lies about dems. Luckily grew out of it over time!",
         "What I wouldn't give to have McCain style conservatives at the helm of the Republican party again. I miss the days when there was nothing to do politically more than have civil policy debates with my friends and neighbors. \n\nWhen did the insane lies invade the conversation? I can't remember when exactly but I feel like it really started with Rush Limbaugh and then expanded with Fox News and then politicians began actually winning elections based on it.\n\nYou can't have a conversation with someone who is starting from a space of denying actual reality, and demonizing people who didn't do the things that they're being accused of. It just...somehow respect and civility got away from us. And I remember that moment with John McCain so clearly.\n\nWe need that back, Conservatives need to demand that from their representatives. Honesty. Integrity. IT MATTERS.\n\nMaybe the problem is that we can't fix any problems when we're fighting with each other based on things that never actually happened...? When the discussion is not in good faith that's not a path to solving anything. If we agree that there are problems that need to be solved, we need to ALSO agree to be honest about the actual issues and what's happening.\n\nThat's what civility, honesty, integrity, respect and decency are for. It's the basis without which nothing can be solved going forward.\n\nHere's to tomorrow representing a return to that vision of ourselves as Americans. It's the one way that I am comfortable in \"going back\", back to the days when we behaved with respect and with an eye towards building a great future for our Nation, not tearing each other down.\n\nAnd OP you're very welcome here, because we may disagree on policy but we agree on what's really important, and I appreciate you for being here today.",

And it's a big responsibility to try to make a decision as to what any one of us thinks will be the best outcome for the rest of us.\n\nBut the central American tenet of respect, freedom, equal rights for all, and that we're all Americans at the end of the day is what holds this country together.\n\nI will be glad when Harris wins because I feel like she's the clear best choice for all of us. I will be glad when Trump goes away because I feel he has been a horrible and toxic chapter in American political history.\n\nIt's not about this side or that side. I don't have a side. I have fellow Americans and a country.\n\nThank you for understanding and feeling the same.",

What you mentioned reminded me of that video because hearing each Republican speak reminded me that you truly can\u2019t have a conversation like that with someone.  If you\u2019d like, I can DM you the video if you wanted to watch it.  I\u2019m not sure if we can post links on posts and I don\u2019t want to upset mods if we\u2019re not allowed to.",

         "Have you been in a thread even tangentially related to relationships or mens/womens rights in a large sub lately? It's a complete shitshow, and reddit is relatively progressive compared to some other platforms. History has thought many conservative heterosexual men that they should be able to get a woman and kids and with the sexual revolution many of them expected to be able to have a lot of sex all the time if they want it. As it turns out, when women get to choose you have to be an actual decent person (not just claim to be one) and make some efforts regarding hygiene and looks to have a shot at a partner/sex. They also have to contribute to both finances and household chores, especially if both partners are working, to keep a relationship. Those things are hard. It's far easier to listen to the shitstains online who say women should be forced into relationships, that women exist to serve men and that society is wronging these men. It's laziness, jealousy and envy driving this. Edit: and greed, I forgot greed.",
