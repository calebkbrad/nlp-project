But I started getting second thoughts about it recently. \n\nI am not a Democrat or a Republican. I disagree with the Democrats (and Reddit) on a lot of issues. But this morning, I was thinking about the Supreme Court. I thought about Trump's actions following the 2020 election, and how the Supreme Court recently gave him immunity for what he did. Then I realized how much I dislike the current Supreme Court for that and so many other things. It's more than just policy. I believe that this Supreme Court is flat out corrupt and I didn't want to reward them. \n\nI won't lie. I'm worried. I don't like the Biden-Harris economy and I want the 2019 economy back. But the economy has been getting a bit better lately, and I really don't like the current Supreme Court. Voting for Harris felt like voting against them. So that's what I did.\n\n**Edit:** Thanks for all the comments. I would like to note, I am well aware that Trump inherited a great situation from Obama and that Biden inherited a pandemic. What really frustrated me was how long the recovery took. I know it was a once in a lifetime event, but I thought we'd get over it faster than this. I could elaborate more on my exact thought process, but what matters is that I decided to trust Harris to get us to where we need to be. \n\n",

The most impactful economic policy is really decided by the non-partisan Fed board rates, or by other factors like the pandemic or migration in the case of home prices. It also can take a couple years for legislative policy to take effect (meaning the 2017-2019 economy was sort of set up by Obama's policies). Trump's biggest proposed policy, tariffs, would be a tax increase on everybody and a massive price increase throughout the supply chain, bad enough that it could lead to recession and would make the 2021-22 inflation look quaint.",

I created a chart of their [GDP growth rate by president since 1947](https://imgur.com/a/qyDYBxB)\n\n* \"What are the consequences of no or limited economic growth?\" \n   * A: This is a summation - The consequences of no economic growth (Trump) --> is inflation, corporate greed (price gouging, predatory practices), layoffs, and more.\n* Even if we ignore the bungling of the COVID crisis by Trump that extended its devastation, the chart is clear that Biden's plan was helpful. It's dampened by the aforementioned 'consequences of no economic growth'.\n\nReal strength is outwards and involves investing in people and their livelihoods; economically and emotionally. Fear is inwards and involves bowing to the worldly rich, building fences, regulating others especially the vulnerable, and an unwillingness to invest in regular people. Even dogs don't like nervous and fearful dogs. Economics is similar IMO, there needs to be calmness and that takes strength.",
         "Thank you for voting for the right candidate. You were never going to get a 2019 economy back. Those days are gone. Trump wouldn't have brought them back and many economists have already said that. We have the strongest economy post-Covid in the world right now.

         "Thank you \n\nIf it helps, presidents don't control the economy. Economies are such complex systems, and our economy is tied together with other economies through trade, that most of what happens is out of the hands of our government. \n\nThere are a few things our government can do. They can raise or lower the national debt, which will affect the value of our currency. They can crack down on price gouging, or allow it. They can regulate Wall Street to allow or prevent actions that create instability in the market. And all those things only affect the economy years down the line. \n\nThe Fed, which is independent, can raise or lower interest rates. That usually has pretty immediate effects.\n\nThe president only has one thing he or she can do by themselves, and that is raise or lower tariffs. Raising tariffs causes pretty immediate price increases for consumers. \n\nSo your vote for president isn't going to affect the economy any time soon, unless the president changes tariffs.",

         "The crazy thing about the economic recovery from covid is that the resulting inflation was a global issue, and we've actually bounced back faster from it than most other countries. The price issues you're seeing, especially at the grocery store, are now mostly the result of corporate greed. They know everyone needs food and we were willing to pay the high prices back when inflation was high, because we don't have a choice. We're still going to be shopping at grocery stores, and the cuts we'll have to make in order to be able to afford to eat will have to come from somewhere else. You're already seeing fast food prices start to drop again because a lot of people just cut that out entirely once it got too expensive. But groceries? They can screw us sideways and we'll still have to shop there. They used inflation as a convenient excuse to keep prices high, and people still think we have massive inflation as a result. Call me a socialist, but if a business is involved in selling something that is necessary for continued existence, the government should be able to step in and limit price-gouging. \n\nAlso, anyone concerned about the price of eggs in specific should know that there's a massive H5 bird flu outbreak. Started in wild birds, spread to poultry farms, and now the poultry farm workers are coming down with it. Not good. I shopped for eggs this weekend. It had been about a month since I'd bought some and the prices had gone from $4 a dozen to $6. I about lost my mind until I realized that there are a lot more factors at play than just corporate greed on that one.

You have many years left of seeing the economy flourish, stagnate, dip down, maybe recess, and climb back up again. Ask your parents about the 80\u2019s recession, or your grandparents about the 70\u2019s recession and having to only buy gas on certain days. Life is crazy. \n\nBut having Trump reinstated in office will do more harm in the long run. You might not be able to choose how many kids you have (zero if IVF is banned or 6+because birth control is banned under p2025), your taxes will go up because of the billionaire tax breaks, you could end up a widow because your pregnant wife couldn\u2019t get a life saving D&C after losing your wanted child. Think about how you want your life to look in the next 10 years.",
         "I work in a large hospital. I do not understand why anyone expects the country to have recovered from a pandemic. It isn't going to recover in this lifetime, my lifetime, anyway.

You're blaming Biden-Harris for fuckups trump made, and that they've fixed.   You're not going to see disinflation (prices going down), but Biden's Federal Reserve managed to get inflation under control and down to very low levels faster than any other major western economy *and without provoking a recession* (which most economists thought impossible).\n\nBoth Biden and Harris have been wanting to take on price gouging like the ridiculous shit at the grocery stores, etc - which isn't inflation, just corporate greed and the billionaires are successfully suckering you into blaming the people trying to stop them.\n\n**Your vote for Harris lets us keep having this dialog.

Trump bragged about sexually assaulting women before 2016 and still won. \n\nBut telling someone what they can/can't do with their own body? There are a significant number of unreligious Republican women out there where this crossed the line. I think the Republicans know this too, as seen by Trump and Vance both trying to walk-back the party's stance. \n\nI think most people would be surprised to learn that a lot of Republicans only identify as Republican because they think Republicans are the party of the rich and Democrats represents poor people. All their stances on social issues are aligned with Dems. The decades of propaganda have convinced millions of low-information Americans that Republicans make you richer and Democrats take your money for welfare. \"I am rich (or want to be), so therefore I'm a Republican.\"\n\nThe Dobbs/abortion issue however is one of those things where you're directly stripping a right away from someone that has been there for decades. Something like this is powerful enough for people to put their party affiliation aside and not vote out of disgust. \n\nIf the Dems suddenly pushed through a decision that men can't have shoulder-length hair (for example), it would be the same reaction I think. Even though there are millions and millions of men that don't and never will have longer hair, there'd be a fair number of Dems that didn't vote (or flipped to the other party) just because the principle of the thing. \n\nThey thought the Dobbs decision was going to be a boost going into this election and empower their base or something. I think if they just waited until Trump won in 2024 to push this stuff through we'd have a much much scarier situation.",

Things shouldn\u2019t have to affect you personally before you realize that they are important and worth caring about. Right wing extremism depends on people being uneducated, ignorant, and fearful. If everyone were like you (open to doing research and forming new opinions based on said research) the Trump cult would be practically nonexistent. \n\nBut seriously, thank you for giving a fuck.

If we look at the facts, the election boards and state legislature of Arizona and Georgia, the two states he pushed hard with the fraud allegations, were Republican. Bill Barr was a Republican and the senior member of his old Administration. Mike Pence was his Vice President. General Mark Milley is a Republican and was his Military Chief of Staff and he's called Trump a fascist. The Federal Elections Commission that worked under Trump found no fraud. Fox News was too damn scared to fight Dominion on election lies so they settled out for almost a billion dollars without a fight. Trump took this lie to Judges, some of which he appointed and others were registered Republican and Independent, and they found no fraud after reviewing legal cases brought forth by the Trump campaign and administration. \n\nThis lie was so big, he tried a coup on January 6 when he exhausted all of his legal options.

He also worked 2 jobs, including his teacher job, to pay for the lunches of under-privileged students at his school. he\u2019s a small town dude, likes hunting and is pro 2nd amendment, but also cares about the american people and our safety. His policies as governor were very pro middle class.\n2. The polls in the last 72 hours have rapidly shifted in our favor. Trusted pollsters such as Ann Selzer and election oracle Alan Lichtman, who has a 9/10 success rate in predicting elections, both have predicted big wins for blue. the odds are good.\n3. next time, don\u2019t drink the kool-aid. always do your research before blindly following an ideology. i didn\u2019t care for Kamala too much at first, but I did some policy research and figured out that she is a strong candidate. try to use more centrist sources to avoid political bias.",

Would you roll the dice and want a world that favors the rich, and hope you\u2019re born into that, but willing to take the risk you\u2019re born poor and have the deck stacked against you? Or would you want to a society that closes the wealth gap and offers everyone equal justice and opportunity?\n\nYou chose as I have.\n\nI am a high-earner and have done well and surely would pay tens of thousands of dollars more under a Harris tax plan than a Trump one.

Conservatives will incorrectly call us \u201csocialist\u201d or some other stupid term and say we \u201clike\u201d high taxes but really it\u2019s just that we believe in everyone contributing to help the less fortunate get a leg up.

MAGA isn\u2019t really Republican and certainly isn\u2019t Conservative. It\u2019s truly just a cult.

She sacrified her power, and her political career. And she worked 70-hour weeks to document what happened on January 6th. And she has never passed up a chance to oppose Trump since. I respect that when she was faced with a tough choice, she had the courage to do the right thing, full steam ahead.\n\nAnd now, Trump is threatening her.

It's struggle to apply compassion, for example, to an external person or group....but when the issue is suddenly *affecting YOU directly*, you suddenly see the light. Because nothing about the issues has changed in the past couple years, just your own personal circumstance did. \n\nI think this is part of why gay rights became such a broadly accepted issue.  Lots of conservatives found out they had gay people in their families, or as close friends.  Suddenly, gay rights wasn't some abstract concept, it affected conservatives on a personal level...and gay rights suddenly didn't seem so bad anymore, because they wanted their son/cousin/neighbor to have them.",

He has managed to convince a significant portion of the population to ignore their senses, to ignore common sense, to ignore *anything* other than what he says is true. \n\nIf you listen to Trump, the left is to blame for all the world's problems. The political divide that we face today, that is the fault of the left. I don't know how old you are, but I can assure you that historically, despite rhetoric, prior to Trump, politics had limits. Trump is the one who destroyed those limits. Trump is the one who mocked a disabled reporter. Trump is the one who attacked a gold star family. Trump is the one who called Mexicans rapists. Over and over again.\n\nAnd, yes, the dems have responded in kind. Hillary called his supporters \"deplorables\" and Biden called them \"garbage\".

Which honestly has probably kept her married since her husband is the stereotypical MAGA, got laid off for sexual harassment, now works a job with all men, has a chronic health problem that\u2019s caused him to max out his insurance deductible every year and need a go fund me to pay it. Loves his guns, anti abortion even though their daughter is his favorite child and is getting married soon.\n\nAnyway my attempts to engage my friend were responded to with \u201cboth sides bad\u201d, my response that we don\u2019t need to fall in love with candidates, just don\u2019t vote for the candidates that will hurt the people we love, were all ignored. \ud83d\ude44",
         "Also, major things with Medicare, since this seems to be an issue they care about:\n\nHarris administration would continue the new policy brought to us by the Biden administration being able to have Medicare negotiate drug prices with pharmaceutical companies, Trump would scrap that. \n\nFurthermore, Harris has pledged to get home healthcare benefits paid for by Medicare which is **HUGE.**",
         "\"She's proposing to add hearing and vision which sounds good but it's nothing.  We need a lot more ....\"\n\nSo a person who isn't paying attention to what would happen to Medicare and ACA if Trump gets elected is mad because the person who would protect those programs isn't giving ENOUGH.\n\nIf we descend into authoritarianism, this person will be the one in line bitching about the condition of the vegetables.  It will be a relief when the secret police drag her out for complaining about the government.",
         "Where did they hear 3m *rental* units? That isn't true. For healthcare, their top issue, I say federalize medicaid and offer a public option under medicaid MCOs- I think we can make that case. The Biden presidency was a very pleasant surprise for lefty voters. With a seat at the table we can argue for more progressive policy. But to get a seat at the table we have to vote. There are only 2 groups with power- the people who write the checks and the people who vote.",

He proudly stood for all the things the party claims to stand for: family, values, and morals. He was enraged by Clinton's blow job and he was thrilled when Bush won. He was an extremely proud Christian who believed in saving yourself for marriage.\n\nHe didn't practice what he preached, though. He moralized and pontificated on purity while sexually abusing me, physically hitting me, and verbally assaulting me almost every day I was with him. He choked both of his ex-wives and me before we left. He threatened to kill me weekly if I didn't do exactly what he said and it only got worse as I got older. We read the Drudge Report daily online, we listened to Limbaugh on long car rides in which he ranted for hours about immigrants, and I wasn't allowed to think about any issue unless I parroted his opinion back to him in his exact words. All women existed for was to serve men according to my dad and for years I believed him.\n\nIt was not until the police removed me in 9th grade that I began to actually truly realize how wrong he was--and I lived in one of the most progressive states in the country, yet was subjected to this level of \"brainwashing.\"\n\nThis is why I am a single issue voter now in my mid-30s. When I voted for Harris this election cycle, what I really voted for was abortion because I don't want another vulnerable girl somewhere to lose the rights I had which thankfully I didn't need to use. \n\n  \nAdmittedly, too, I love the idea of my estranged father losing his mind over a woman commander in chief too. \ud83e\udee1\n\n  \n",
