         ">\"Throughout his campaign, President-elect Trump made multiple clemency promises to the January 6 defendants, particularly to those who were nonviolent participants,\" their filing said. \"Mr. Carnell, who was an 18 year old nonviolent entrant into the Capitol on January 6, is expecting to be relieved of the criminal prosecution that he is currently facing when the new administration takes office.\"\n\nCome to think of it, I wonder if the Tiger King is also expecting a pardon.",
         "Awww, that's cute.  He thinks Trump gives enough of a fuck to pardon him.",
         "They\u2019ll get pardons anyways if Trump even remembers about them.",
         "Go ahead and send the traitor to jail.  Trump will let him out soon enough.",
         "None of  those Jan 6th defendants should have their cases delayed or  dismissed. They all need to be tried and convicted for the crimes they committed. If re-elected Trumpy wants to pardon them, that is his problem. Those Jan. 6th bastards should have the stain of the conviction remain permanently on their record, to show what they did was fucking stupid. It's one thing if you vote for Trumpy, that is your right, but you don't have the right to storm the capital and try to hang the former VP.",
         "They\u2019d be cell mates with ***trump*** \u2014 if our legal system actually worked.",
         "Yeah, someone forgot that loyalty is a one-way street in Trumpworld.\n\nThe buyer\u2019s remorse is coming, but it\u2019s going to be cold comfort for those of us who wanted no part of this debacle.",
         "He\u2019ll just pardon all of them, anyway, won\u2019t he?",
         "I\u2019m betting Trump eventually pardons all the convicted\u2026.",
         "This country failed. There will be no punishment for the traitors. Everyone will get away with their crimes. California is couldn't even ban slavery ffs.",
         "Suddenly he doesn\u2019t want the government to be tough on crime.",
         "I bet he won\u2019t even pardon the Jan 6 folks.  Trump has no reason to appeal to anyone now. He\u2019s not running for reelection after 4 years.",
         "They sure can have their pardons, they just need to have a million bucks in spare change lying around.",

         "Not that it fucking matters anymore...",
         "US democracy is fucked, it now comes down to which side will use the tools the Supreme Court gave them first. We know the Republicans and Trump will absolutely use them. Biden and the Democrats could grow some balls and enforce Colorado\u2019s decision on a national level and straight up bar Trump from taking power since he isn\u2019t eligible to hold office. SCOTUS just said Colorado can\u2019t leave him off the ballot, they never said they were wrong on deeming him ineligible. So, enforce that ruling as an official act and send the insurrectionists to Gitmo.",
         "straight to jail, traitors!",

         "Well, the republicans will be responsible now for the country's complete lack of any moral authority over its citizens. If this guy is so not responsible for his behaviors to the point we reelect him, then why oh why would ANYONE really care about right and wrong now? Situational ethics will be the least of these moral lapses now.",
         "Wouldn't matter. Trump won't pardon any of these fools. That would be like admitting he sent them to the capital to riot.",
         "He won the election. These people were useful to him when he cried about it being stolen. He doesn\u2019t need them anymore he doesn\u2019t need any supporters anymore. This man doesn\u2019t give a damn about anyone who voted for him",

         "I don\u2019t see any reason why he wouldn\u2019t. And then he fires and jails every prosecutor and agency staff that worked on their cases. Same thing he\u2019ll do for his own cases. It\u2019s all about ego now.",
         "TBH, Trump and his cronies might do it now. They have full control of all three branches plus the supreme court, releasing a couple of low level jackasses for brownie points from the cult wouldn't be beyond consideration now.",

         "Maybe Trump cares for the guy maybe not, I don\u2019t know. But regardless a motivation for him to pardon him would be to send a message that \u201cif you fight for me you\u2019ll be protected\u201d, which then inspires other people to fight for him. \n\nAnd if it happens enough, pretty soon people might not want to speak out as much.",
         "He no longer has any reason to pardon him. He's won and will use the GOP majority in the house and senate to establish a new monarchy. \n\nIn 4 years we will be choosing between Trump Jr. and Eric Trump as POTUS.",

         "Trump hates losers. To him the Jan 6 mob lost and so he hates them",
         "Don't they have to admit guilt? So far they have been crying they're innocent, but to get a pardon, I believe admittance of doing the crime is needed. \n\nI'm sure they will because now it will be a badge of honor to them and not the shameful shit show it truly was.",

You don't know how anything works at the Federal level, but you're ready to write a fictional scenario where you demand that Democrats pull a coup on the incoming President by executive fiat, which is the exact insurrection sin that you'll never forgive... At least, when it's the other side. Hilarious, if it weren't so sad. I'll save you some heartache now, what you're suggesting is not legal, not enforceable, not justifiable to the public, not good for the already tarnished image of the Dem party who want to win midterms in 2026, and not going to happen. Don't get mad at Biden for not doing your literal impossibility, either.",

If you don't put these people away for good, if you don't lock up Trump, then their prison time will only organize them and fuel their rage.\n\nI mean we can talk about the Harris campaign all we want, but I hoenstly think this lands on Joe Biden. \n\nHe needed to fix shit post 2020.

At the time, basic rights were not being legislated on by the state government. Instead lots of niche concern issues were being enshrined in the constitution because they couldn't get traction with elected leaders. This led to election day ballots that were 7, 8+ pages long since the full text of each one was printed so you either did a lot of reading in the voting booth, or a lot of prep work going through all the issues. The 60% threshold was sold to voters as a way to reduce or eliminate the practice. \n\nThe proverbial straw that broke the camel's back was the amendment whether pregnant pigs should be allowed to turn around: [https://ballotpedia.org/Florida\\_Amendment\\_10,\\_Treatment\\_of\\_Pregnant\\_Pigs\\_Initiative\\_(2002)#:\\~:text=Florida%20Amendment%2010%20was%20on,turn%20around%2C%20with%20certain%20exceptions](https://ballotpedia.org/Florida_Amendment_10,_Treatment_of_Pregnant_Pigs_Initiative_(2002)#:~:text=Florida%20Amendment%2010%20was%20on,turn%20around%2C%20with%20certain%20exceptions)\n\nIt was wrong then in hindsight and wrong now, but emphasizing again - the state GOP of the time was still very much laissez faire.

Look on the ass beating received and reflect on the things liberals are amplifying every single day on social media.

That used to work in like ...the 90s. The democrats clearly don't understand modern people's view points. Now all that does is show that they are the party of the 'establishment', the party of the 'liberal elite'. To contrarian working class voters who want to do a protest vote because they lost their job at a factory or something, the other party will become far more appealing. And yes I know Trump is a billionaire but these people have been manipulated to believe he is in their corner.",
         "That's a high price to pay for 4 years with bad memes.",
         "Does anybody know where to find the complete list of things Trump says he was going to do, starting with the day after Election Day?  I think he said mass deportations start immediately when he takes office and I think he said the Ukraine war will be over on Day 1.  I\u2019d like to keep track of his lies and failures.

It doesn\u2019t matter about the stock market, or how the US economy is doing relative to the rest of the world. \n\nWhen inflation spiked in 2022 this outcome was predetermined.",

Shame.\n\nFor people who don\u2019t understand, Pennsylvania isn\u2019t done voting and once Philadelphia is counted it will be much closer.

         "The democrats have been shitting the bed for years. They\u2019ve failed to host primaries, pushed this agenda of a 80 year old president running again and never addressed issues that the public was saying we need to address in their campaign. They chose to rather hope the Democratic Party had a mutual agreement with people and chose to rather go after Trump. They needed to address hot button issues like the economy or inflation but instead they told us why they don\u2019t matter. That\u2019s a slap in the face.",

         "Those numbers are damning. Just complete rejection of the Democratic Party by both their usual base and by swing voters. \n\nI don\u2019t even know what the party is supposed to do in 2028. Feels like the US is shifting more and more right, to the point an Electoral victory is further out of reach in the future.",
         "The margins in \u201cblue\u201d states are shockingly narrow. I couldn\u2019t believe how close Illinois and New York were.\n\nEdit: her margin of victory in these is getting much larger.

         "Yep, democrats didn't go out and vote. Trump had 73 million votes in 2020. Counts aren't finished, but it's looking highly likely he won't reach 73 this time. **Trump won 2024 with fewer votes than 2020**.\n\nBiden won 2020 with 81 million votes. Kamala will be lucky to reach 68. That's over 15% fewer votes on the Democrat side. That's more than a swing vote.",
         "Their campaigning blows my mind. It\u2019s like they intentionally made all the wrong decisions. How do you fuck up so badly and bet the house on candidates who are less likable than Trump? They basically reran the Hillary campaign. Calling half the country stupid doesn\u2019t really help get new votes.",
         "They really screwed over their entire voter base this election and it's really hard to see materialize into a loss this bad. We may never recover from this in our lifetimes. I'm not even 40 yet, this is horrible.",

         "Trump got roughly the same votes as 2020.  Harris performed worse than Biden in 2020.  We lost to the couch.  Democrats didn\u2019t make good enough of a case to get off the couch and vote.\n\nWe\u2019ll get what we deserve.",
         "Things are still getting counted, but yeah, he'll probably get the popular vote too.  I'm also curious to see what turnout will be.  I thought Harris was a stronger candidate than Biden and I thought she would do better.\n\nThe democrats missed an opportunity to have Biden not run, go through a proper primary, and let a strong, non-administration candidate win.",
         "I lived in Italy for a few months as a teen in 2011 and it was so crazy for me to see how deeply most Italian citizens (at least the ones that I knew) *hated* their own leader. Like Italian nonnas would curse at the TV when he\u2019d come on. I so clearly remember trying to imagine what it would feel like to be that at odds with your country\u2019s leader and what an unsettling idea it was (I was steeped in Obama and Aaron Sorkin optimism). \n\nUnfortunately I got to experience it myself not too long after\u2026.",
         "The problem isn't Trump. If he was never born, someone else of similar bad character would be doing what he's doing. Maybe not in as \"Trumpian\" of a way but he or she would be like that.

         "You are absolutely correct.",
         "This is the correct answer. Inflation isn't something like 20% over 4 years. It's more like 100% in all the things that matter without substituting products (the govt started doctoring inflation statistics in the 80s to minimize Social Security COLA increases). And it's in the big 3. Energy, food, and shelter. Add to that regulations have a habit of killing jobs (of which many citizens are working multiple) and it becomes pretty simple to vote for a guy who goes \"I'm going to bring back jobs by making american labor more competitive\".",

There's just.. no interest in long term consequences, only the right here and right now.\n\nedit: if y'all need some proof of this, [here](https://i.imgur.com/zYNe5oi.png) is a chart of the government deficit to gdp ratio over the last 40 years, coloured by the active government party. As this chart is by fiscal year, the moments of changes of party might look a bit odd. But remember, a president elected in 2000 only enters office 3-4 months into the fiscal year 2021, and the first budget passed under their government is actually the budget of 2022.\n\nAs you can see, whenever democrats are in power, the deficit tends to shrink each year. When republicans are in power, it tends to grow.",
         "Here\u2019s the problem though. The GOP playbook on the economy for about 100 years has been to do nothing, it\u2019ll fix itself on its own. Their policies have historically led to recessions and depressions.",

Their entire platform is built on not trusting media and they are fully incentivised to lie and say they'd vote democrat because that makes it look worse for Trump and they convert what looked like one vote for Harris into two votes for Trump. And the reality is the focus on minority groups isn't going to work because minority groups and well...a minority.

The reasons are many and complex, but much of it is due to the disappearance of old-growth forests and the increased reliance on tree farms with much younger trees. In the 1940s, most construction lumber was cut from trees that were decades old, today they may be as young as 9 years old. As a result, the 2x4s in the commons bin in a typical American lumberyard are cut from small, fast-growing trees, mostly \"white wood\" (SPF on the stamp, spruce, pine, fir).\n\n\n\u00a0With younger trees being lumbered, many mills have relaxed grading standards.\u00a0 The folks I have talked to who buy lumber from and for lumberyards consistently tell me that what we consider #2 grade lumber today (a common construction grade) would have been classified as #3 not long ago. Furthermore, boards are not graded for twists and bows. Carpenters are expected to \"crown\" the studs in a wall so the boards all bow in the same direction and the wall appears flat. The result is that even though the wood may be suitable for construction, the overall appearance of common 2x4s sucks dead toads.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0And if the lumber's appearance is not bad enough, there are other problems you may encounter that are not so visible: \ufeff\ufeffFast-growth wood is more likely to rot. \ufeff\ufeffYoung trees have poor dimensional stability - they may even shrink lengthwise. \ufeff\ufeffThe sugar in the sapwood may attract fungi and insects If the wood is dried quickly, it's more likely to develop checks, shakes, honeycomb, and other drying-related defects \u2022 Young wood is more likely to have \"reaction wood\" that bows or warps as you cut it.\n\n\n\u00a0 But I did notice that the 2x12s that we used for the steps and stringers were of a much higher quality. Because they were wider, there were necessarily cut from bigger, older trees. They weren't perfectly clear, but there were fewer knots and defects than in the 2x4 stock, and the knots tended to be tighter. So we bought some 2x10s* and ripped our 2x4 railings from them - it worked wonderfully. *Why not 2x12s where you can get three 2x4s out of each? Because you have to use the middle board, and most of the defects, especially the pith, are closer to the middle than the edges. Furthermore, the outside boards tend toward quartersawn and riftsawn grain, which is a good deal more stable than the plainsawn middle.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0As a bonus, the 2x10s were lumbered from Southern Yellow Pine (\u201cSYP\u201d on the stamp), a much stronger wood than the white wood 2x4s. If you want the numbers, the specific gravity of Ponderosa Pine (a common SPF) is just 0.38 on the average, compared to Southern Yellow Pine at 0.59, making SYP much denser and harder. Ponderosa Pine has a bending strength (modulus of rupture) of 1.29 Mpsi and a stiffness (modulus of elasticity) of 9,400 psi; while Southern Yellow Pine stands at 1.98 Mpsi and 14,500 psi respectively.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThere is an important consideration you should be aware of, especially if you plan to use any of these woods in woodworking projects. Construction lumber is typically kiln-dried to just 19% moisture content. You will want to get that down below 10% before you can rely on the stability of the wood. At 19%, it\u2019s still shrinking! This may mean air-drying the wood for 6 months to a year before you use it. \u201c",

When she was younger she would read and re-read each graphic novel dozens of times  as she was learning and piecing it together. I think parents may be too quick to discard the medium like it's junk food. But it's fantastic for getting them into it.

We are currently reading through Little House on the Prairie series. I read it when I was a kid, too. My best friend got me the first two books for my bday when I was in 2nd/3rd grade (my daughter's age).

I read stuff on my phone, too, if I'm not reading from a book. It starts at home getting children interested in some sort of book. I went the route of graphic novels for my daughter, because she liked to read but books without at least some pictures was daunting for her in the beginning. I take them to library to get books and their school does library day once a week where they check out books to read and bring home. Not liking to read isn't an option in my household. I tell my kids there's always SOMETHING that could interest you in any of the books you see. My daughter loves animals and horses so she gravitates to those type of books.

Manga is in black-and-white and you read it backwards. And manga\u2019s popularity rose at the same time as the rise of video games and social media.

I think this has more to do with parents approach to reading (or lack thereof) and a consistent decline in funding school and public libraries. \n\nIt also seems like schools have a great difficulty teaching literature that connects with students. There was such a blow back to Harry Potter and other YA that it wasn\u2019t the \u201cright\u201d kind of reading and with conservative \u201cuproar\u201d over basically anything recent, school curriculums are stuck with really outdated books that bore kids to tears.",

When I was a kid(I was born in 1990) there was all of this children's programming that touted the benefits, and fun, a book contains; Reading Rainbow is the most prominent example of this, but there were many other programs that would emphasize the fun in reading.  I grew up loving books so much, and I genuinely believe I grew up a better person, and smarter, because I was exposed to so many sources of imagination, and learning, during my formative years.  Ninety percent of the content children absorb now is just brainrot content, and I fear it's going to get more concentrated as newer generations of parents who were exposed to that sort of content aren't going to encourage their children to read.

They can't go play outside on their own, partially because of parental paranoia and partially because our physical neighborhoods are increasingly hostile towards children being out playing. They are at home, and their drained parents, many of whom are addicted to screens themselves, engage in neglect by just letting them sit in front of a screen for hours. I cannot imagine the friction these people are going to have with expectations of them as they get older. Schools have responded to this by lowering expectations of students themselves. We didn't teach these kids how to read right, we let social media shape their brains from a young age and damage their ability to learn and function in classrooms, and they get to go into a world with few safety nets and little care for their well-being.

I hated having to do that and it made me not want to read because I didn't care at all about the topic I was being forced to research.\n\nWhat made me a reader was the fact that I simply didn't have access to anything else to do growing up. We had 1 TV in the house, and I didn't have any say as to what to watch, which meant I spent a significant amount of time sitting in my room finding ways to entertain myself. And that meant reading. \n\nAnymore parents stick TVs in their kids room playing videos 24/7. Then they give them tablets/smartphones/video game consoles so they can be engaged with those constantly.

         "But kids can literally carry their 'TV' around with them 24/7, and everything else has to compete with it for their time.\n\nThat, combined with the absolute destruction of their executive function due to binging on hours of rapid-fire, short-form social media content (i.e. TikTok), makes it obvious why kids are less likely to sit down and spend more than a few seconds looking at anything that isn't a screen these days.",
         "Not at all the same. TV and what you got on it was pretty much just passive entertainment. It had a singular purpose, and for the longest time, that was just fine. What we have today in just one device are MANY elements within it that are aggressively trying to hijack your brain in order to keep your eyes on them, and a great many of them are interactive, which makes them all the more exciting and extremely addictive. Sure, this affects adults too, but imagine the effects on a younger, developing brain. It's basically crack, and no book is going to stand a chance against it without some kind of external intervention.",
         "So, TV is designed to attract and maintain your attention, but through very different methods and with different abilities to track habits. The element of false socialization isn't as high with TV at all. The influencer economy is a huge part of why social media is more predatory towards kids than cable. Watching Nickelodeon and staying glued to the TV all day is not good for kids. But we don't have studies showing that it is causing as much lasting harm as the various apps and instant on demand gratification that a phone inflicts on people. The ability for your device to be with you everywhere is also a large component. Barely anything on the Internet is regulated, so the programming these kids get is on another level from what got on TV in terms of manipulation. And we all know that what got on TV wasn't very good in the first place. The ability to have interaction, even in small ways, is a game changer for getting people hooked.",

There\u2019s certainly a lot more emphasis being put on trying to make things addictive these days than there used to be.

         "You have a lot of replies but I'll still throw in my two cents. I was nearly held back for my development and then 2 years later was in the top of my class for English and reading (Texas has/had a graded reading program separate from English class)  \n\nManga comes in a variety of genres and targeted age, some series can be extremely wordy like hunterxhunter or death note while others focus on the art and the flow of action. A good place to start imo would be to first branch out from manga and see if they have any interest in manwha and manhua which should be an easy sell and would really broaden the number of cultures exposed too as well as genre options and of course options over all when it comes to teen vs adult stories. \n\nAll 3 of these are effectively the same medium, and culturally all 3 typically either start as light novels/webnovels or are later adapted into a light novel etc. In fact you are much more likely to find a \"comic\" form of the story cancelled early while the book form is continued or properly finished in most cases. Watching a show or a movie that is based on a previously read manga will highlight the differences and artistic choices made while telling the story and once a person understands that the book version is typically the most detailed and well thought out version it's all about personal taste. \n\nAs an example, I watched sword art online over a decade ago and like many was disappointed by the brevity of the first arc before the turn that the next 2 arcs went for. The manga was new and short and then I discovered the light novels were something like 8 or 9 books deep. So I chewed through those and ended up liking the series as a whole much more due to the overarching points the author was trying to make about Ai and \"artificial life\". The entire context of the story gets changed a bit by the intentional focus on things the anime itself downplays while also being much further along, something the anime took a decade to catch up on while everyone was being critical of the shows dressing while never discussing what the author is going for, which would also be a fair criticism of the books but the release schedule for the light novels was fairly short and complaints were limited to book by book discussions while the anime was broken up by arc and the manga made last of all. \n\nIt's fairly typical as well for a crappy manga with bad art to actually have a well written story underneath that gets cancelled due to popularity, or for the inverse of a beautifully drawn story covering for what is effectively a grade school level story. If you can broaden the options and introduce the novel forms of some of their favorite stories eventually they will develop preferences",
         "It's a lot like training wheels, at some point, they have practiced enough that when they get given the right opportunity and just the right book they just start picking it up. But it doesn't magically happen. Plenty of people go their whole lives just doing the bare minimum reading to get by school (not even that sometimes) and just never reading again when they get to the real world.\n\nAlso! Never treat graphic novels and manga as something childish. Having a love for them is still a great thing as an adult. Let them have that as they get older. Just also keep trying with text only books.",

So, you need to view getting to \"real reading\" as a progression or ladder.  Start with the lightest stuff and work your way up.  \n\nAs for that specific jump from graphic novels to full chapter books, find a series that does both. Get them invested in the characters, world, etc, and let them make that jump. Added benefit of the rigor/text load is probably similar so they will still be accessible. \n\nAlso don't be above rewards for being a successful reader.  Kids respond to extrinsic motivators. Just try to avoid bribes.  The key here to differentiate between a reward and a bribe is rewards are proactive and your idea as the adult.  Bribes are reactive and generally a compromise.",

If these children are engaging with print on paper that\u2019s a win to begin with. Then you help bridge the gap with maybe lower level novels and build up with buddy reads,  read alouds, audios, etc. Then hopefully the teaming wheels are off and they can engage with full length novels. I am in no way shape or form advocating that they stay with a graphic. I know the value of reading because I deal with the effects every day of students who don\u2019t like to read. They can\u2019t write well, they even have issues with expressing ideas. They don\u2019t test well.

And was forced to read novels written by age appropriate novelists in high school. I did not come from a supportive home. My mother and father had a 4th and 6th grade education respectively. They did their best.\n\nI've read a graphic novel or two out of curiosity for this trend. I read Waltz with Bashir. And to American adolescents who have read this graphic novel, I'm sure it was a great cultural exchange and informative. Hopefully this led to a further explanation of this conflict.\n\nBut it really skims the topic of a complex issue.\n\nWe are at an intersection where too many people lack basic critical thinking skills. Media has become silo'd and too often digested in 60 second burst on social media. If Kids aren't \"forced\" to cultivate these skills in high school, I worry the window to acquire the skills to read and digest longer texts will be lost.\n\nKids at Ivy League schools are approaching professors telling them that are not able to read novels. I was reading Virginia Wolfe, Faulkner, Louise Erdrich, Chinua Achebe, Christopher Isherwood and EM Forster in college.\n\nThese novels touched on women's rights, racism, the Indigenous Genocide, Colonialism, the rise of an authoritarian state and Queer Culture.\n\nI went to a middling state school. These novels incited a curiosity. And coming from a White, working class background opened up radical new viewpoints that I continue to explore decades later.\n\nI think these kids are being coddled. And with the rise of the STEM fields, I am concerned that the Arts and Humanities will become a smaller part of the undergraduate experience. And in turn remove the opportunity to explore other views. Especially those different from the reader. This in turn allows for a celebration of diversity. And not the current trend with one party to outlaw teaching about slavery and other marginalized groups.\n\nThanks for your opinion. I offer mine with the greatest respect for yours.",

On his own, he wasn't hurting anyone by that, even though I thought it was a waste to live like that 24/7, but now he has a boy who just wants to run around and be a kid. Hell he bought a house with no yard. I think he's preferred that his son be an introverted hermit like him, working at a library like him, hating people and small talk like him, but everyone is different, and I can just tell he tolerates with gritted teeth, but is annoyed and stressed out even by his son's exuberance.",
         "It's 100% why.\n\nYou can exercise it like any muscle. If you're interested in improving your reading stamina, I would first recommend that you keep reading things you enjoy.\n\nAlso, you should take things that are just on the edge of your comfort zone and set a stopwatch to see how much you can handle at once. If it's only ten minutes, set a goal to read ten hard minutes every day until it feels easier, then bump it up by 5 minutes or so. \n\nEventually, you'll get to a point where you can read hard stuff for an hour at a time, and your textbooks will stop feeling so challenging.",

         "I have issues with my old man from childhood, but one thing I will say, is that he always supported my brother and I being outside, we played sports, little league, did scouts, rode bikes, went fishing, to the beach, etc. He moved us to a more rural area when they really couldn't afford it, because they wanted us to have a yard to play in, and it paid off. Maybe someday I can be a cool uncle to that kid. We'll see."

         "I used to work at a cemetery. They had a common crypt or tomb for the remains of people who have never been claimed dating as far back as almost 100 years. It\u2019s legit, they were laid to rest with dignity and the tomb itself is at the heart of a memorial for the very people who left this world alone. It\u2019s sad, but it\u2019s not uncommon for families to discover long lost relatives have been entombed there. I even assisted a family in reclaiming the remains of a relative who passed over 20 years ago. They were cremated, but nobody claimed the decedents remains. After one year, their urn was placed in the crypt where it sat for 2 decades before relatives came to retrieve them and give them a proper burial. The paperwork was lengthy as chain of custody can get more cloudy as time passes.",

The funeral home may not have even known they were veterans of the Civil War - they just cremated the bodies and kept the cremains in storage. If the funeral home that handled the cremations had been acquired by another funeral home, which happens often, any knowledge of those cremains could have been lost in the process or just due to sheer time. \n\nNothing malicious, just sheer circumstance. \n\nAnyway, they have now been identified and can finally have their remains placed permanently instead of just sitting on a shelf.",

I watched the documentary referenced in another comment.\n\nI miss the booming economic optimism from the 90\u2019s that carried over into the 00\u2019s.

That place is eerie...I used to go there to fish in the pond/lake there because it had killer gar and bass, and after katrina was a crabbing hot spot. Company knew the security so we could just go in. Creepiest place in the world and I grew up in a haunted house. \n\nThe smell of decay, swamp, and just nobody else around in all that is like nothing else. You don't feel safe, even during the day. I was hoping they'd just let nature reclaim it because that area is not exactly near other things and floods so damned much. Just make it a memorial park for fishing and nature because nobody is going to go there for anything else otherwise. It was in a terrible location and new orleans east became a bit of a joke and a bad part of town even before the hurricane. We even stopped servicing the east because of crime and people trying to rob us.\n\nLocals never got why they built it out there, and honestly it should never have been. There are places on the west bank that would have been better, or even out near Kenner, or maybe take out some of the blighted warehouses and near empty areas around Jefferson highway in southwest metairie.",

         "Yeah but didn't the hurricane happen in 2005?",

When they chose to build \"Jazzland\" as it was originally called, and then stuck it way out in the east, it was destined to fail.  I had an annual pass the first year and I only went one time - it was dismal from day one and never got any better.

         "None of that will ever happen, unfortunately.\n\nNew Orleans East, which is where the park was located, has been suffering blight since the 1980s.  The city experienced a boom as a result of increased oil drilling activity in the area but since then, oil companies have been importing more oil since it's cheaper, and the whole area and population has been in decline.\n\nAt one point, the world's largest shopping mall was located in the area.  That shut down prior to Katrina.  The whole east New Orleans region is in decay.  It makes no sense to do any development out there that isn't industrial, and even then, it remains to be seen if the location is practical.  Plus Louisiana has a long history of enticing corporations to come to the state, then screwing them over.  Most recently they keep doing this with the film industry: one minute there's tax breaks, the next there isn't.   This often is the result of the alternation of republican and democratic governors.  When the republicans are in, they unleash fossil fuel industry restrictions and screw everybody else, including any deals previous administrations made with industries they deem \"un-friendly\" to the right.\n\nRight now, Louisiana has a governor that's more concerned with forcing schools to display the 10 commandments and taking children's scholarships away if they don't kneel for the national anthem, than they are in fostering a healthy business environment.\n\nThe reason the park failed is precisely because they decided to build an amusement park in an area that was in decline - they ignored all the market research.   And then they proceeded to design a park in the swamps that had virtually no shade.  It was dumb from the start.  The only brilliant move made was getting Six Flags to buy it.",

         "These corporations need to clean up their shit afterwards.",
         "Six flags bought it after it went bankrupt. Never had a chance to reopen. While he\u2019s right none of it was six flags fault.",
         "they probably would have fixed stuff, and re-opened, if they thought the park was a real money maker. but they didn't",
         "Jazzland was bankrupt in two years. Sounds like a non viable market and with high risk factors.",
         "LOL.. sorry that's not correct.\n\nThe park was poorly designed.  I was offered a job there and turned it down due to the horrible working conditions.\n\nThe park lasted from 2000-2002 when it went into bankruptcy.  \n\nThen Six Flags took it over and re opened it as \"Six Flags Over New Orleans\" - that lasted until 2005 when Katrina hit and they never reopened it.  If the park was profitable, they likely would have reopened it.  But it wasn't.  And Six Flags was having financial problems.  It made more economic sense for them to declare the park a \"total loss.\"   The main reason being, it was a stupid idea in the first place and poorly designed and located in a bad area that had multiple issues.",

         "Agreed, this shit however was still actively used for a long time as a movie set \n\nhttps://www.nola.com/entertainment_life/10-movies-shot-in-new-orleans-old-jazzland-theme-park/article_7955e6da-bbdd-11ed-ba1e-9f604df3d37b.html",

They were losing tons of money so it was a great excuse to never re-open.\n\nJazzland opened in 2000.   Went bankrupt in 2002.  Six Flags took over the park in 2002 and reopened it.  Katrina hit in 2005.",
         "That's not right, Six Flags leased it in 2002 and launched in 2003.\n\nThe park didn't reopen after Katrina, written off as a loss in 2006 then the lease ended in 2009 when the company went bankrupt.",
         "Well yea, hurricane made a real mess of it.",
         "Not to mention, Six Flags also confirmed that this was one of their least profitable parks in their portfolio.",
         "Jazzland was a fun theme park though, just built on a house of sticks essentially. The Megazeth(?) was my first roller coaster.",
         "Maybe? Who knows how it would've turned out. We'll never know on account of the hurricane that destroyed the whole thing. Seems like maybe that played a factor. You know, Katrina. The hurricane that destroyed it?",

         "This is why I oppose corporations not being tied to specific people. I believe that the 1% highest compensated individuals should be directly responsible for all of their doings. So if Facebook goes into bankruptcy, Zuckerberg would be directly financially responsible for all of their debts and clean up of their facilities. If a corporation does something that an individual would be personally held liable for then the top 1% individuals go to prison. \n\nThe reason I say top 1% is because if we tied it to specific titles then I think they would just put random people into those titles",
         "I once hiked through a field full of rusty, non-working wind turbines in Hawaii. They just left them there to rot.",
         "Even to this day, there's been groups rallying to reuse, rebuild and re-open the park.\n\nI've toured it over the years and the idea that even half the structures could still be used is laughable, but there were a constant parade of groups lobbying the city to let them try to engage in development -- this is why the park wasn't demolished earlier.  There was always routine talk of somebody re-opening it.\n\nThe problem was, all the proposals to do so were devoid of any substance.  Lots of press releases and plans, but no committment of the kind of money needed to really follow through.  (One of my favorites was local businessman Frank Scurlock's \"dream\" of building a huge Noah's Ark there - visible from the Interstate) and creating a Christian-themed family fun park.   Basically everybody jockey'd to get the properly from the city under the plan it would be re-opened and re-used, but what they really wanted was a sweet sale/lease for a large swath of land they could do something else with later.  The city wasn't stupid though, and wasn't about to give anybody that kind of deal.  At least give them credit for that, that it didn't turn into a giant landfill.",

It attracted 1.1 million visitors for its first season, but that decreased to 560 to 580 thousand the next season; Alfa filed for bankruptcy reorganization in February 2002.[20] Citing its benefit to the local economy, HUD loaned $25.3 million to build the park, and after Alfa went bankrupt, the city of New Orleans became liable for the remainder of the loan.[21] In 2001, the lease was put up for sale, and in March 2002 Six Flags purchased it for $22M,[21] although the park\u2019s name did not change that year. The New Orleans city council approved the 75-year lease in August 2002; under the negotiated agreement, repayment of the remaining $24.4 million loan from HUD was to be split between the park ($1.4M/year) and the city ($1M/yr).  \n\nReference [Six Flags New Orleans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Flags_New_Orleans)",

If you have old 767s, you are going to choose one of those, whichever makes the most sense for your route network.\n\nThe A350 kinda competes with the 777, but also doesn't at the same time. The 777 is bigger by a significant margin, and whenever the X actually finishes certification, will be more efficient. But the A350 has RANGE going for it, incredible range.\n\nAirbus has the Bombardier C Series (A220) in a segment that Boeing does not compete in. Likewise, Boeing offers a super heavy freighter in the 777F, and even when the A350F comes out, it will still have a smaller payload capacity.\n\nOffering wise, both companies have very competitive lineups. Decisions on what to buy are not made based off feeling. Lots of complex calculus goes into what aircraft an airline chooses to buy.",

Similar to mental health institutions built in the West after World War 1, a lot of them have facilities for \"controversial\" therapy techniques like electro-shock therapy. \n\nSome of the better ones were built by charities. Some of the best medical facilities in Iran are doner/charity funded. It's not easy to get into those, and I doubt the government sends detainees to those places. \n\nAnd Of course, Iran has private mental health hospitals, which are mostly meant for drug rehabilitation. They tend to lean toward the expensive side. \n\nIranian government has a habit of sending people to mental institutions as a way of discrediting them. Especially political prisoners. Something as simple as a tattoo can be considered a sign of mental illness as far as the government is concerned. \n\nPrisoners who are sent to mental institutions don't usually stay there for long.

         "So this went exactly as expected. No court wants to be the one to make the decision. And in the end Elon Musk gets to pay people to vote, even though that's supposed to be illegal. There is nothing you cannot do or get away with in the United States if you're rich enough.",

That still doesn't explain how the winners are selected...merely that once selected, they are vetted. That's still not a game of skill, but one of chance.\n\n2. Vetting voters to make sure they \"align with the group\" is a fucking crime, punishable by up to 2 years in federal prison (plus state-level crimes). It is awarding money to voters only if they agree to support the values of the PAC. It's pretty blatant.\n\n3. This is in complete contrast with the public statements made by Elon Musk in announcing the sweepstakes. \"'We are going to be awarding $1 million RANDOMLY'\" (emphasis added) \"'to people who have signed the petition, every day, from now until the election,' Musk said at a campaign event in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.\"\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2024/10/20/politics/elon-musk-voter-giveaway-legal-questions/index.html\n\nThat's fraud, if they changed the rules of the event without notifying participants.",

         "A LOT of misinformation in the comments, likely because the article doesn't understand what they are actually reporting. To be clear, Musk is still in trouble here, but he got one small win in that the injunction request has been denied. The injunction request was essentially denied because it would be a legal proceeding that is unnecessary since this whole \"not a lottery\" scheme is over tomorrow and that they have admitted that the scheme is not a lottery, that no one had a real chance of winning anything unless they were picked.  \n   \nThis is not the end of the legal troubles in this case, it literally only says, \"Fine, give the last 1 million out, we don't want to be bothered in stopping it, instead we are going to punish you in a later hearing for breaking the law.\"  \n   \nWhile I would argue the injunction still should have went through and that it is a \"public relations\" win for Elon, it is not a legal win at all. He still has the legal shit storm of paying people to vote/register, and he still has to deal with any new legal issues that his admission in court will now cause.  \n   \nHe got a short term win here 100%. If Donald Trump gets elected, he gets a long term win as well - but even that is a murky win since technically this is a state case and Trump can't pardon it. If Harris wins, Elon has screwed himself over in so many ways that long term this is pretty bad for him.",

If they had insufficient evidence to convict the individual then the proper course is to drop the case. It isn't to try to get some level of 'justice' anyways. That isn't justice. That is why I take issue as I said with this kind of deal. If they felt strongly about their case then a deal like this is insufficient. If they felt their case was weak enough that this deal was appropriate then they should be dropping the case instead. It is insufficient in either way.",

I understand it was Sheila's hair, the whole point is that her hair was in a place it reasonably should be and there seemingly was not anything that tied the vehicle to the murder. In fact it seems to be the opposite that there is testimony that excludes the vehicle from being the one used by the murderer. If there was additional evidence that linked the car to the murder then that would certainly help, though it doesn't really change the fact that it is not unusual for her hair to be in the car.",

For all the families that can only put enough on per week it\u2019s like paying for an extra meal, it\u2019s not fair for people that are struggling. I bet with the COL crisis it\u2019s not just low income families struggling either.",

The winner could be black - or a Democrat - or hate him - or say bad things about him online!  Or, god forbid, all four!\n\nSo, you knew from the start that it would all be a lie, and he was just going to be giving money to his friends.\n\nThe fact that his lawyers are coming out and straight-up admitting to massive fraud - tells you how scared they are of the illegal-lottery charges.",
         "The reason they are saying it wasn't a lottery has to do with the requirements around sweepstakes versus a contest. Essentially the one they want to avoid is a sweepstakes/lottery, where there is random selection. Where random selection occurs there is more rigorous requirements from laws, such as alternative methods of entry. A contest on the other hand can have other rules, including the organization selecting the winners with intention. The difference between the two is nuanced, but essentially they are trying to argue this was a contest not a sweepstakes or lottery. Contests allow for it to be a qualified marketing expense to giveaway money, so long as there is not an equal chance of winning for every entrant. [https://nationalsweepstakescompany.com/blog/sweepstakes-vs-contest/](https://nationalsweepstakescompany.com/blog/sweepstakes-vs-contest/)\n\n  \nThe thing I don't think they did though was layout the requirements of how winners would be selected in advance. So they may still run afoul of the rules around contests. The thing is here though there are two sets of laws, one is around election interference, and then around sweepstakes/contests. I would argue that they have violated both, but election laws may carry more than civil penalties and fines. I would imagine the lawyer wants to keep this as close to a marketing campaign for Trump, and them just not following all of the rules they should have and end up paying a fine. The reality I hope for is there are some actual criminal charges, but we will have to wait and see.",

At least one device was located and neutralized in Birmingham, UK, and another in Leipzig, Germany. These specific instances are believed to have been practice / test runs for later, larger scale sabotage. This occured in July, but underscores the effort Russia is actively putting forth to sabotage the US and NATO allies, to include harming civilian commercial transportation.  \n\nEDIT: Thank you for the correction, GRU is not KGB successor but a contemporary. More analogous to the American DIA vs KGB~CIA. Either way, nefarious and Soviet-era linked nature still stands",

Coy, who is white, was fired after the shooting. He later told jurors that he thought Hill was holding a silver revolver.\n\n\u201cI thought I was going to die,\u201d he testified.

If you can't definitively say your, or someone else's, life is actually in danger then you shouldn't be shooting. It's nuts to think \"split second decision\" is somehow a defense.\n\n> The officer\u2019s attorneys argued that Hill\u2019s lack of a weapon did not matter because Coy thought his life was in danger. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t reckless, he was reasonable,\u201d Collins said during the trial.\n\nJust for context, Hill was just sitting in his car. Some neighbor thought it was \"suspicious\" and called the non emergency line. Somehow this POS cop came to the conclusion Hill was robbing the place and had a gun. In actuality, Hill was visiting a friend's place. Oh and it's not even known of it was Hill's car that was reported as suspicious. Literally nothing about this was reasonable.\n\nAnd the cherry on top? They let him bleed out on the ground:\n\n> Video recordings from Coy and others show that none of the multiple officers on the scene made an attempt to render first aid to Hill until ten minutes after he was shot.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Andre_Hill",

We hold our bartenders to a higher standard, so why not the \"protect and serve\" city employees?",

Prosecutors asked that the former officer be sentenced immediately.

         "[Here's a much better article](https://abcnews.go.com/US/adam-coy-verdict-ohio-shooting-andre-hill/story?id=115326088). It doesn't add the courtroom bullshit or that the cop is being treated for treated for Hodgkin lymphoma, both trying to make you feel bad for the cop.\n\nI'll just copy the text.\n\n\n>Former police officer Adam Coy was found guilty of murder on Monday by a jury in the 2020 fatal shooting of Andre Hill, a 47-year-old unarmed Black man who was shot four times after the defendant ordered him to emerge from a darkened garage while holding a cellphone and a large set of keys.\n\n\n>The jury in the high-profile Franklin County Court of Common Pleas case announced its verdict after deliberating for about two-and-a-half days.\n\n\n>Besides murder, the jury also found Coy guilty of felonious assault and reckless homicide.\n\n\n>\"This verdict delivers a measure of justice for Andre Hill's family, who have waited nearly four years to see criminal accountability for his tragic and unnecessary death,\" national civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump, who represents Hill's family, said in a statement. \"Andre was an unarmed, innocent man, and his life was taken with disregard for the duty to protect and serve. Today\u2019s verdict underscores that no one is above the law, including those sworn to uphold it.\"\n\n\n>Crump added, \"We hope these verdicts bring some healing to the Hill family and send a powerful message: accountability in law enforcement is not optional.\"\n\n\n>Coy asserted during the trial that he feared for his life when he mistakenly believed Hill was leveling a silver revolver at him as he stepped out of the garage on Dec. 22, 2020. But the silver revolver Coy testified that he believed Hill was holding in his right hand turned out to be a set of silver keys.\n\n\n>\"I thought I was going to die,\" an emotional Coy, a former member of the Columbus Division of Police, testified last week.\n\n\n>Coy faces a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole. He is scheduled to be sentenced on Nov. 25.\n\n\n>After the verdict was announced just after noon local time, Judge Stephen L. McIntosh revoked Coy's $1 million bond and Coy was immediately taken into custody by court officers who led him out of the courtroom.\n\n>Coy was fired from the Columbus Police Department about a week after the shooting.\n\n>About a month after the shooting, Coy was arrested and indicted in the killing of Hill.\n\n>Coy did not turn on his body-worn camera until he shot Hill, but the device has a \"look-back\" function that automatically activated and recorded 60 seconds of the episode without sound, including capturing the shooting.\n\n\n>The body camera footage, which was played for the jury, also showed that as Hill lay dying on the floor of the garage, none of the officers who responded to the incident appeared to immediately provide first aid. The footage showed a woman coming out of the house and telling officers that Hill was a guest and that \"he was bringing me Christmas money. He didn't do anything.\"\n\n>The jury reached its decision after hearing closing arguments on Wednesday.\n\n>During his summation, Franklin County prosecutor Anthony Pierson told the jury that the evidence proved beyond reasonable doubt that Coy's use of deadly force was not justified, according to his training and national police standards.\n\n>\"This case isn't about someone who is resisting arrest, where officers pile on him, put a knee on him or something like that and he died,\" Pierson said. \"This case is not about someone who tells cops, 'I hate you. I'm going to shoot you,' It's not about that. It's about a man who was following police orders and was killed for it.\"\nMORE: Jurors in murder trial of former Ohio police officer offered contrasting theories in killing of Andre Hill\n\n>Coy's attorney, Mark Collins, slammed the state's case, saying prosecutors did not prove the charges beyond reasonable doubt.\n\n>\"We now know that the government's theory that somehow he [Coy] shot an unarmed man and made the entire thing up after the fact,\" Collins told the jurors, referring to Coy's claims of self-defense after wrongly believing he saw a gun in Hill's hand. \"But that's perverse ladies and gentlemen. That's desperate ladies and gentlemen. That's the government ladies and gentlemen.\"\n\n\n>Collins added, \"I'm surprised they didn't say that he planted the keys.\"\n\n>In May 2021, the City of Columbus agreed to a $10 million wrongful death settlement with Hill's family, the highest amount ever paid by the city.\n\n>The indictment of Coy in February 2021 came just days after the Columbus City Council also passed Andre's Law, which was named after Hill and requires Columbus police officers to turn on their body cameras when responding to calls and to immediately render first aid after a use-of-force incident.\n\n\nI think we know who the defense attorney is voting for.\n\n>Coy's attorney, Mark Collins, slammed the state's case, saying prosecutors did not prove the charges beyond reasonable doubt.\n\n>\"We now know that **the government**'s theory that somehow he [Coy] shot an unarmed man and made the entire thing up after the fact,\" Collins told the jurors, referring to Coy's claims of self-defense after wrongly believing he saw a gun in Hill's hand. \"But **that's perverse** ladies and gentlemen. **That's desperate** ladies and gentlemen. **That's the government ladies and gentlemen.\"**\n\nYeah, I do think he made up the I feared for my life story after the fact, he didn't even think his body cam caught the shooting because he didn't turn it on until after he shot him. But he didn't know the bodycam has a \"look-back\" function that automatically activates and recordes the 60 seconds before it's turned on, just without sound. \nThat video captured the shooting and what's probably got him convicted. \n\nAlso the feared for my life, they get 24 hours to meet with union reps and superiors before they have to give an official statement, where they have their union lawyer and union representative also sitting in. For context you get arrested and formally charged you must give your statement immediately.\n\nThat's why the few cops in the videos that cry and say things like I didn't know, or I'm sorry, or show a normal human response for killing an innocent person. Suddenly on their official statement they feared for their life or the life an safety of a colleague/civilian/rich white guys money. We could've lost all of them unless I shot and shot and shot and shot until my magazine was empty\n\n\n>**Collins added, \"I'm surprised they didn't say that he planted the keys.\"**\n\nWow, that's an experienced attorney everyone.",

         "More than a dozen of Lewisville Police Department\u2019s officers faced disciplinary action after an investigation found that they acted inappropriately while trying to catch prostitution suspects at local massage parlors.\n\nIn a statement, Lewisville Police Chief Brook Rollins said the misconduct happened between October of 2022 and June of 2024.\n\nThat\u2019s when the department\u2019s undercover officers began an operation targeting alleged prostitution at massage establishments in the city.\n\nThe operation yielded 23 cases in two years with 32 criminal charges against 28 suspects at 10 businesses. However, the Denton County District Attorney rejected all of those cases.\n\n\"The DA\u2019s office stated they were not able to prosecute these cases because the undercover officers had been engaging in inappropriate physical contact with the suspected prostitutes. I obtained the list of declined cases from the DA, and we immediately began an administrative review,\" Chief Rollins said.\n\nAn internal review found 13 Lewisville police officers violated the city and department's policy prohibiting physical contact once probable cause for a prostitution arrest has been established.\n\nIn other words, once the undercover officers agreed to pay for the sexual contact, probable cause was legally established, and no touching needed to occur.\n\nIn the end, three officers were fired, one was demoted, and seven were suspended without pay. Two were also given counseling, and several were reassigned from their undercover roles.\n\nThe department also had to return two seized vehicles and $247,807 in seized cash.\n\n\"To the residents of Lewisville, this entire incident is embarrassing and disappointing. As the Chief of Police for the Lewisville Police Department, it is my job to ensure the department operates with the utmost professionalism, integrity, and honor. I am sorry that we fell short of that,\" Rollins said.\n\nThe results of the department\u2019s internal review were turned over to the Texas Department of Public Safety and the Texas Rangers for a criminal investigation.",
         "This same thing occurred in another jurisdiction many years ago. I can't remember where it was though.  Cops actually went through with receiving sexual services.\n\nAlso, I spent  2 1/2 years as a police reservist.  In my experience, cops can't keep their pants zipped up.  They screw police groupies, many screwed the same one.  One had a wife about to drop a baby in a month and was cheating on her.   I looked up to one of the officers who seemed to have his stuff together and seemed like a solid person.  Turned out he was screwing the dispatcher while his wife was undergoing treatment for blood cancer. \n\nAnother story is one screwed known local prostitute.  Other guys on the force found out about it, got stationary from the hospital and mailed the letter to him that the proustite had aids, named him as a John and that he should get checked.   They let him believe that for over a week before telling him.",
         "\u201cThree were fired. One was demoted and seven were suspended without pay.\u201d  \n\nSo police officers broke the law and then arrested the women who they paid for sex with. Only three were fired. None of them charged with crimes.",

A lot of stuff is already priced ridiculously high according to what you can barely afford... what happens when a woman who's uneducated with maybe not even a high school diploma, has to turn to prostitution to pay the bills? And what happens when said prostitution industry becomes mainstream enough where a few big companies run the entire industry and lobby out anyone else? \n\nIt'll likely turn into the amateur acting, modeling, and music industry with extremely predatory and confining contracts. Once your sex life becomes a valid and marketable commodity, suddenly you can begin enforcing forced sex contracts, virginity contracts, chastity contracts... Look, I love chastity as a kink - it can be fun when both parties are consensually involved. But I genuinely fear that parents will start enforcing their childrens' virginity once it becomes lucrative, parents grooming their children to become popular stars... but instead of of stars, it's just being a contracted five-star prostitute.\n\nHonestly I'm fine with the status quo but that's just my potentially biased perspective - not ridiculously heinous as long as you're not bragging everywhere, but also not mainstream enough where everyone wants a piece of the pie. It's already not bad since women have a reasonable amount of freedom to run OnlyFans / other sex work on their own (other than credit card companies trying to ruin the fun) even though there's still some shaming. But trying to institutionalize this would strip all the freedom from them.\n\nI would like to hope that this doesn't happen - but given the current trend of politics with abortion rights being taken away from women, I don't doubt that there would be people who would ***wholeheartedly support*** selling off their children or wives into prostitution.",

Unfortunately, this one was much worse than previous red alerts.\n\nEDIT: for those who can read Spanish, check this link.\n\nhttps://las4esquinas.com/la-aemet-activa-la-alerta-roja-en-valle-de-abdalajis-por-fuertes-lluvias-y-tormentas/\n\nThe same day, there was ANOTHER red alert for flooding in the south of Spain. Nobody has heard of it... Why? Because nothing happened there, apart from some damage to roads.\n\nBesides, this summer, we've been given constantly red alerts for intense heat. Spain would have collapsed if every red alert for heat had received the same attention that people are saying this red alert for flooding should have received (people are saying Valencia should have been paralyzed prior to the flooding - this summer, that would have meant large areas of Spain paralyzed for long periods of time).",
         "Germany had the NINA app for those warnings. Which nobody knew existed before the govt responded to questions about the floods with \"we warned them with the NINA app\".",

         "Spain is unbelievably federal, it's literally a bunch of autonomous states loosely united as a country. Bear in mind that the 2 main regions don't even share a language, and that most counties (such as Valencia, the region here) have their own democratically elected president. You are calling him a regional premier, but he is literally the [President of the Valencian government](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_Valencian_Government).\n\n\nThe regional authorities literally do not have the authority to issue alerts to the public, that is the responsibility of each region, and the regions send alerts to their citizens. For comparison, saying 'the Spanish government' should have sent the alerts is like saying the EU should have made a broadcast on French TV, or that the United Nations should stop false election posts in the USA.\u00a0\n\n\nThere are decisions that bodies can make and pass down, urging the relevant authorities to act, but if they don't have the legal authority (or means) to somehow leapfrog the authorities below them, it's absurd to say they're responsible.\n\n\n\n\nIt's also worth noting that Valencia is one of the regions in Spain that does not have a hugely active independence movement, and seems reasonably content to be part of Spain (whereas a majority of Spain has independence referendums every few years which are ignored). The local government is of a very, very different ideology from the main government, decided last year to disband the regional emergency response teams, and the president spent the day before the flood receiving alerts and making public statements like 'The worst of the storm seems to have passed' and 'we are in no danger'.\n\n\n\n\nSo it's incredibly disengenuous to say it has anything to do with the local government and to brush off the regional governments responsibility, especially in this rare case when the people have voted for the existing powers of local and national government responsibilities.\n\n\nNow that's got nothing to do with the royal family, but it's not the first time a right-wing nationalist party has screwed up and the people who voted for them have blamed a random figurehead.",

The king has use of various palaces but they don\u2019t actually belong to him, they belong to the Crown which basically means the government. He can\u2019t sell the Crown Estate for profit nor does he have direct access to the revenue. The government uses some of the revenue to fund official royal duties but they pocket most of it. Duchy of Lancaster is a substantial amount of land and investments set aside to generate a private income for the sovereign but it\u2019s also not his private property.\n\nHis personal assets are in the form of property like his residences of Sandringham and Balmoral, other real estate and various shares in companies, a bunch of jewelry, artworks, cars, racehorses, and an extremely valuable stamp collection worth over \u00a3100 million originally started by Queen Victoria\u2019s consort Prince Albert.

         "I don't think his contribution to music can really be overstated. He wrote so goddamn many songs for an absolutely massive range of artists. From big band swing with Count Basie to the king of pop himself. Produced the absolutely legendary Thriller album. Everything he touched was absolute gold. He has the third most Grammy awards out of literally everyone. \n\nElla Fitzgerald, Dizzy Galespie, Frank Sinatra, Louis Armstrong, Count Basie, Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, Michael Jackson, and dozens more. He composed, arranged, and produced for fucking *everyone* and was a big part of keeping jazz alive through the 50s and 60s when rock and roll was much more popular. He worked behind the scenes (and in front of them as well, he had a bit of a well-earned ego) as the beating heart of an entire genre of music.\n\nRIP to an absolute legend. The world of music is a worse place without him in it",
         "Damn. He was instrumental in making The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air happen.",
         "My Quincy Jones story - in 1986 I was 14 and I visited my older brother who was living/working in downtown LA (we were from the rural mid-west).  Since I was a basic bitch I was a huge Lakers fan at the time (Kareem, Magic, etc) and my brother took me to a game at the Forum.  About half-way through the second quarter during a time-out, my brother said, \"Come on, we're upgrading\".  We walked down to the floor, directly behind the Lakers' bench (3 ft from KAJ!), passing right in front of Jack Nicholson!, and grabbed a couple of seats in the 2nd or 3rd row mid-court behind the Lakers' bench.  When I asked whose seats these were, the only thing my brother said was, \"Be cool.\"  So I enjoyed the game.  At half-time, the lady seated next to me starting talking to me.  She eventually asked, \"So how do you guys know Quincy?\"  I just mumbled something about my brother working for IBM (which he did) and she moved on.  Even little old rural me knew that there was only one Quincy who had season tix to seats like these.  I spent the rest of the game enjoying myself but more than a little scared that the night would end with Quincy Jones hollering at me.  But he never showed and at the end of the game the lady next to me said, \"Say hi to Quincy!\"\n\nThanks Quincy for all the music etc and the great seats for 2/3 of a Lakers game in 1986!",

He studied under [Nadia Boulanger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nadia_Boulanger). If you don\u2019t know who she is look her up. She taught and worked with so many twentieths century composers it\u2019s incredible. (Stravinsky, Copeland, Glass, etc) She was tough as nails and quite literally whipped you into musical shape. And she only took on people she considered rare talents that could handle themselves as such. Clearly she saw the true talent of Quincy Jones",

So Will and Jazz went off on their own and made their own theme song in secret (the theme which was used), complete with the rapping.

         "Article Text:\n\nBEIJING (AP) \u2014 Three Chinese astronauts returned to Earth on Monday after a six-month stay on the Tiangong space station, part of China\u2019s effort to be a global leader in space exploration.\n\nA parachute slowed their capsule\u2019s nighttime descent to a remote landing area in China\u2019s Inner Mongolia region. The crew emerged after touching down at 1:24 a.m. A Chinese national flag stuck in the ground near the capsule flapped in the wind.\n\nIn recent years, the country\u2019s space program has brought back rocks from the moon and landed a rover on Mars. It aims to put a person on the moon by 2030, which would make China the second nation after the United States to do so.\n\nThe space station astronauts returned after welcoming a replacement three-person crew last week for the latest six-month mission. The new team of one woman and two men will conduct experiments, carry out spacewalks and install equipment to protect the station from space debris.\n\nA space agency official said in April that Tiangong had maneuvered several times to avoid debris and had partially lost power when the solar wing\u2019s power cables were hit by debris, according to a report from the official Xinhua News Agency.\n\nChina is among the countries that have created space debris, including the reported break-up of a rocket stage in August during the launch of the first 18 satellites for a global internet service similar to Starlink, the still-growing constellation of satellites operated by Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX.\n\nTiangong, which means Heavenly Palace, was completed two years ago and orbits the earth.\n\nOnly Chinese astronauts have gone to the space station so far, but a space agency spokesperson said last week that China is in discussions to select and train astronauts from other nations to join the missions, Xinhua reported.\n\nAstronauts from several nations have traveled to the International Space Station, but China is blocked from that program mainly because of U.S. concerns over the military\u2019s involvement in China\u2019s space program.\n\nChina laid out an ambitious plan last month to become a leader in space science research by 2050 in conjunction with its advances in space exploration.",

It merely allows Iowa to require some voters to submit a provisional ballot which will be counted when the propriety of their voting is established.  Yes it's an inconvenience, but it's not a deprivation of rights.\n\nThe political reason I like it is that it is going to blow up in Republicans' faces when they find NO NONCITIZENS TRYING TO VOTE.  They've made their hunt public and now they'll have to tell us what they find.  It's the best proof there is that there is no issue with noncitizens voting.\n\nThe philosphical reason I like it is that it is a decision in favor of the Republicans' position by a judge appointed by Joe Biden.

Trump won on a fluke, or more likely, he won because Bannon and many others found a pretty ingenius way to capitalize on social media and hypertarget electoral districts to eke out an improbable win. \n\n2.

The category also includes certain stimulants, sedatives and opioids.\n> \n> It\u2019s the first time a state has classified abortion pills as controlled substances.\u00a0\n> \n> The new lawsuit, filed Thursday, alleges that the law could create barriers for health care workers who need to administer mifepristone and misoprostol quickly in an emergency, thereby delaying patients\u2019 access to the pills and creating a risk of harm. The complaint also says the law discriminates against people who need the medications, since patients with similarly severe medical needs aren\u2019t subject to the same delays if they need other drugs. It seeks to prevent the law from being enforced.\n> \n> According to the American College of Medical Toxicology, mifepristone and misoprostol do not meet the definition of a controlled substance.

         "MAUMERE, Indonesia (AP) \u2014 Indonesia\u2019s National Disaster Management Agency said Monday that at least 10 people have died as a series of volcanic eruptions widens on the remote island of Flores.\n\nThe eruption at Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki around midnight spewed thick brownish ash as high as 2,000 meters (6,500 feet) into the air and hot ashes hit several villages, burning down houses including a convent of Catholic nuns, said Firman Yosef, an official at the Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki monitoring post",
         "Guys, I wouldn't live near a volcano",
         "I think there might be a mistranslation there. The eruption was big, but not that big. Like maybe very low end VEI3 Vulcanian eruption from what I understand for this specific paroxysm. Unless these houses were in a river valley and hit by a lahar due to rain after the eruption, it does not appear that that much material was actually released.\n\nFor reference, the eruption of the Ruang volcano earlier this year, also in Indonesia, emitted 3 separate pulses, one of those was VEI3, and the other 2 were Plinian VEI4, the entire eruptive sequence was a VEI5 eruption. This was a much, much larger eruption, producing much more volcanic debris. The eruption plume from both large VEI4 pulses was over 25 kilometers. Yet, it resulted in only a few inches of accumulated ash 4KM away on the neighboring Tahulandang.\n\nPutting this in scale, the Lewotobi eruption ejected between 10 and 100x less tephra compared to Ruang. Considering the stated plume height of only 2 kilometers, I would put it on the smaller side of that so closer to 100x smaller than Ruang's eruption.\n\nThis being a mistranslation also matches up with the pictures I have seen of the aftermath of this eruption.\n\nhttps://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2182153098.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill/f_webp\n\nhttps://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2182149018.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill/f_webp\n\nhttps://static.dw.com/image/70679718_1006.jpg\n\nhttps://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/8597/live/f203b220-9a7e-11ef-8db6-ef78bfd874ce.jpg.webp",

         "\"The vote was closely watched in Brussels a week after Georgia,\u00a0[another ex-Soviet state](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/georgia-moldova-votes-show-challenges-eu-enlargement-push-2024-10-29/)\u00a0seeking membership, re-elected a ruling party regarded in the West as increasingly pro-Russian.\"\n\nWRONG!

         "Domestic and international observers reported attempted meddling by Russian state actors..so, regardless the entities trying to interfere gained nothing.",
         "They won but ?",
         "I think you're confusing diaspora with citizens voting from foreign countries where they work. Like the Philippines and Tajikistan, many citizens of Moldova work abroad and send earnings home to family. As citizens, they are entitled to vote, which is not meddling. They have a voice in their country's future.",

         "By that logic, as an American living in the UK, still paying taxes in the US, intending to return to the US at some point because that's my home, I'm \"meddling\" somehow by voting.",
         "lmao cope harder tankie",
         "Right, they won, but apparently a substantial swathe of voters support the pro-Russian party, so the governance challenges continue.",
         "I don't think there is any question about which side is better for Moldova but it's also fair to note that there was certainly interference from all kinds of governments and interests. Any election in the area is going to have foreign influences and I'm not going to be sad if the western ones win out.",
         "Does Transnistria vote in the Moldovan elections?",
         "Apparently they do, but as the article at the link I attach reads, there are usually low voting turnouts by residents in that region..\nhttps://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2024/10/20/7480548/"
