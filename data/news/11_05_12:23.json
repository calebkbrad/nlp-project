         "Article text, which is short:\n\nBernard \u201cBernie\u201d Marcus, the billionaire Home Depot cofounder and a Republican megadonor, who in recent years became an outspoken supporter of Donald Trump, has died, according to an internal memo obtained by CNN. He was 95.\n\nThe Home Depot didn\u2019t immediately respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment.\n\nMarcus, who had a net worth of about $7.4 billion, according to Bloomberg\u2019s Billionaire Index, gained his fortune from establishing the Home Depot with Arthur Blank in 1978. The duo grew the orange-clad retailer into a retail behemoth that now has 2,300 stores and a stock market valuation of nearly $400 billion.\n\nMarcus was Home Depot\u2019s CEO until 1997 and served as the company\u2019s chairman until his retirement in 2002.",

You could build clean water facilities in some impoverished area.  Nobody had enough resources to fix a problem area in the entire world, but you could make a meaningful difference in just one city.  They'd build statues after you. You'd be known for something.  Marcus will forever be just another rich asshole.",

I dry rubbed them basically with just salt and pepper, seared them on both sides over a high flame, then popped them into the oven at 450 until the center got to 135.\n\nSo, the reason why I am posting is I think this was a little too done.  I mean, the flavor was great, and they weren't dry, but the texture had just gone a bit harder than I was hoping, and the meat in the center looked like it *just* turned from pink.\n\nWhat do you guys prefer?  Everything I see online says pull pork at 140, should I have pulled them at 130?  125?\n\nSince it was on cast iron, maybe the residual heat from the pan kept it cooking after I pulled it?

The reasons are many and complex, but much of it is due to the disappearance of old-growth forests and the increased reliance on tree farms with much younger trees. In the 1940s, most construction lumber was cut from trees that were decades old, today they may be as young as 9 years old. As a result, the 2x4s in the commons bin in a typical American lumberyard are cut from small, fast-growing trees, mostly \"white wood\" (SPF on the stamp, spruce, pine, fir).\n\n\n\u00a0With younger trees being lumbered, many mills have relaxed grading standards.\u00a0 The folks I have talked to who buy lumber from and for lumberyards consistently tell me that what we consider #2 grade lumber today (a common construction grade) would have been classified as #3 not long ago. Furthermore, boards are not graded for twists and bows. Carpenters are expected to \"crown\" the studs in a wall so the boards all bow in the same direction and the wall appears flat. The result is that even though the wood may be suitable for construction, the overall appearance of common 2x4s sucks dead toads.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0And if the lumber's appearance is not bad enough, there are other problems you may encounter that are not so visible: \ufeff\ufeffFast-growth wood is more likely to rot. \ufeff\ufeffYoung trees have poor dimensional stability - they may even shrink lengthwise. \ufeff\ufeffThe sugar in the sapwood may attract fungi and insects If the wood is dried quickly, it's more likely to develop checks, shakes, honeycomb, and other drying-related defects \u2022 Young wood is more likely to have \"reaction wood\" that bows or warps as you cut it.\n\n\n\u00a0 But I did notice that the 2x12s that we used for the steps and stringers were of a much higher quality. Because they were wider, there were necessarily cut from bigger, older trees. They weren't perfectly clear, but there were fewer knots and defects than in the 2x4 stock, and the knots tended to be tighter. So we bought some 2x10s* and ripped our 2x4 railings from them - it worked wonderfully. *Why not 2x12s where you can get three 2x4s out of each? Because you have to use the middle board, and most of the defects, especially the pith, are closer to the middle than the edges. Furthermore, the outside boards tend toward quartersawn and riftsawn grain, which is a good deal more stable than the plainsawn middle.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0As a bonus, the 2x10s were lumbered from Southern Yellow Pine (\u201cSYP\u201d on the stamp), a much stronger wood than the white wood 2x4s. If you want the numbers, the specific gravity of Ponderosa Pine (a common SPF) is just 0.38 on the average, compared to Southern Yellow Pine at 0.59, making SYP much denser and harder. Ponderosa Pine has a bending strength (modulus of rupture) of 1.29 Mpsi and a stiffness (modulus of elasticity) of 9,400 psi; while Southern Yellow Pine stands at 1.98 Mpsi and 14,500 psi respectively.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThere is an important consideration you should be aware of, especially if you plan to use any of these woods in woodworking projects. Construction lumber is typically kiln-dried to just 19% moisture content. You will want to get that down below 10% before you can rely on the stability of the wood. At 19%, it\u2019s still shrinking! This may mean air-drying the wood for 6 months to a year before you use it. \u201c",

We are currently reading through Little House on the Prairie series. I read it when I was a kid, too. My best friend got me the first two books for my bday when I was in 2nd/3rd grade (my daughter's age).

I read stuff on my phone, too, if I'm not reading from a book. It starts at home getting children interested in some sort of book. I went the route of graphic novels for my daughter, because she liked to read but books without at least some pictures was daunting for her in the beginning. I take them to library to get books and their school does library day once a week where they check out books to read and bring home. Not liking to read isn't an option in my household. I tell my kids there's always SOMETHING that could interest you in any of the books you see. My daughter loves animals and horses so she gravitates to those type of books.

Independent play is a great skill to teach, but children also need lots of quality time with their parents, doing things together and especially reading together.\n\nFor every baby shower I always give a couple really good books for infants along with my other gifts from the parent's registry (and diapers, always some diapers).

I grew up loving books so much, and I genuinely believe I grew up a better person, and smarter, because I was exposed to so many sources of imagination, and learning, during my formative years.  Ninety percent of the content children absorb now is just brainrot content, and I fear it's going to get more concentrated as newer generations of parents who were exposed to that sort of content aren't going to encourage their children to read.  Teachers, those few parents who love reading, and libraries, are really our last bastions of hope for this.\n\nI hate to sound like an old man, but I miss the old days.",

But graphic novels contain more rare words than traditional novels and help children develop visual literacy.

Not sure if its a fair comparison.\n\nEdit: a few seem to be misunderstanding when I mean its not a fair comparison. Both have had ill effects on society,  but as u/Calydor_Eastalon said below, comparing the two is akin to comparing the addictive qualities of sugar vs that of heroin.",
         "But kids can literally carry their 'TV' around with them 24/7, and everything else has to compete with it for their time.\n\nThat, combined with the absolute destruction of their executive function due to binging on hours of rapid-fire, short-form social media content (i.e. TikTok), makes it obvious why kids are less likely to sit down and spend more than a few seconds looking at anything that isn't a screen these days.",
         "Not at all the same. TV and what you got on it was pretty much just passive entertainment. It had a singular purpose, and for the longest time, that was just fine. What we have today in just one device are MANY elements within it that are aggressively trying to hijack your brain in order to keep your eyes on them, and a great many of them are interactive, which makes them all the more exciting and extremely addictive. Sure, this affects adults too, but imagine the effects on a younger, developing brain. It's basically crack, and no book is going to stand a chance against it without some kind of external intervention.",
         "So, TV is designed to attract and maintain your attention, but through very different methods and with different abilities to track habits. The element of false socialization isn't as high with TV at all. The influencer economy is a huge part of why social media is more predatory towards kids than cable. Watching Nickelodeon and staying glued to the TV all day is not good for kids. But we don't have studies showing that it is causing as much lasting harm as the various apps and instant on demand gratification that a phone inflicts on people. The ability for your device to be with you everywhere is also a large component. Barely anything on the Internet is regulated, so the programming these kids get is on another level from what got on TV in terms of manipulation. And we all know that what got on TV wasn't very good in the first place. The ability to have interaction, even in small ways, is a game changer for getting people hooked.",
         "It\u2019s also what they said about novels. The moral panic around these things is the same shit with every new medium. \n\nThat said, I do think that modern internet video as a format is rife with problems previous ones did not, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unique to kids and is indicative of broader issues in our culture as a whole. There\u2019s certainly a lot more emphasis being put on trying to make things addictive these days than there used to be. The rise of video games as a niche hobby to massive industry is pretty much a case study of that process in action. But, it\u2019s not so much the format that\u2019s the problem as it is the people trying to exploit it for profit.",

They\u2019re basically designed to make you hate reading and not teach you any practical way of engaging with texts. To the point that I never used any of the methods they taught me in high school to ever analyze a text in college.

Reading Red Dragon got me to read the whole series, A Study in Scarlet had me blasting through Sherlock Holmes on my own. And that extended to things that weren\u2019t just leaning towards popular culture, it included things that would be considered closer to the classics, something like The Maltese Falcon. \n\nI\u2019m not going to say everything I was forced to read in high school was a poor choice, but their age and stuffiness made them so unrelatable for a teenage kid. I won\u2019t pretend all of the choices were like that, The Kite Runner stands out in my head as a strong exception that was useful due to its modernity, but those exceptions were so few and far between",

That began to dry up as NCLB began focusing on non-fiction and short passage reading. Librarians retired and we're replaced with aids or parent volunteers. Budgets for these 'extras' dried up.

I can also retain information about what I read at a very high rate (I know what a character looks like, even if I can't draw them). From reading others' experience with afantasia on reddit, this seems not too rare overall.\n\nBut yes, I also enjoy graphic novels and agree that for those with afantasia who'd like a visual of the story, they're the perfect compromise. I also think it's a matter of culture and personality as well to some extent - introverts and lower-energy kids tend to like reading, while extroverted and more hyperactive kids don't as much. And if you're read to from your earliest age (so, from 2 or 3 years old) and taught to love storied and storytelling, this I think helps tremendously, which I don't know how many parents have time to do.",

Even more, how would we integrate them into our society? The truth is they wouldn't. It would take multiple generations for them to properly integrate, and there would be no shortage of problems in the interim. We have enough problems.\n\nRussia has no problem just throwing North Koreans into the meat grinder. But we don't use human wave tactics in Ukraine. And having soldiers in the field with you that don't care about your cause and don't speak your language is more likely to just end up getting good soldiers hurt.",

They're essentially going from living in the 50s and not having been in combat for 70 years to being dropped in the middle of a 21st century war in a world they probably can barely comprehend. Trying to survive this war while simultaneously battling with the destruction of your entire worldview has got to be some other level of fucking suck.\n\nShell them all to hell and back, but still.

         "That\u2019s where a lot of the labor is :( They also sell human organs much like China does. I believe that people who are executed will be dissected and organs sold in China, and NK likely got the idea from them.",
         "Yes. I\u2019m sad for the individual human who has been put into that situation. But . . . . Perhaps this early and intense shelling will cause some of them to reconsider their loyalties.",

         "Fact is kind of a hard word here. The fact is that by law work internment (not death) absolutely could happen to their families. At least for the defectors who speak openly about it though it\u2019s unlikely, even more so for those not high in political rankings.",
         "Yeah, up to a quarter of NK defectors in South Korea [have seriously considered returning to North Korea](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-12-15/north-korean-defectors-returning-to-the-hermit-kingdom/9254654). It's a tough adjustment and the SK society isn't particularly friendly towards them anymore.",
         "The difference is a sizable portion of Ukrainians speak Russian.",
         "I saw a report that a group of former DPRK soldiers who defected are petitioning to be able to go to Ukraine and do broadcasts and stuff to urge the troops there to surrender and defect. I hope we end up with mass surrenders rather than the Russians forcing them into the grinder.",
         ">That person is sharing propaganda from 30 years ago.\n\nThat's why we like what he says.",
         "Because it\u2019s unsubstantiated information meant to manipulate your opinion and isn\u2019t even up to date? I guess to each their own, but I prefer knowing what the reality is."

He still has the legal shit storm of paying people to vote/register, and he still has to deal with any new legal issues that his admission in court will now cause.  \n   \nHe got a short term win here 100%. If Donald Trump gets elected, he gets a long term win as well - but even that is a murky win since technically this is a state case and Trump can't pardon it. If Harris wins, Elon has screwed himself over in so many ways that long term this is pretty bad for him.",

We should invade Iran and kill hundreds of thousands of civilians in response.\n\n/s\n\nI sure hope you never find out what abuses US police have done to some folks... especially minorities... the last thing we need is for people like you to argue that Americans are all despicable animals that need to be shown the way with some rocket fire...\n\nAs to religion... the woman literally stripped off her clothes, was walking around and screaming, while pulling down her underwear.  You can see her do this in the video.  She would have been arrested for that in just about any nation of the world, including the US.\n\nMany other nations certainly wouldn't have brutalized her over it, and I'm not saying she should be beat up, raped, tortured, murdered, etc... over it.  It was a minor non-violent crime, if it was a crime at all given the situation.  She was clearly a woman having a mental health situation and needed assistance.  And certainly the people who supposedly caused her to flip out by ripping her clothes need to be held responsible for their conduct.  They of course won't be.\n\nNot all nations have the same morals, values, and laws.  While their laws can certainly be argued to be excessive / extreme and even immoral, it's their laws and they can only change those laws internally.  Suggesting we, and outside nation, should attack Iran over it and force them to change their national laws is, frankly, insane.\n\nIt would be far more useful for the US to create social and economic ties with Iran, so that our culture can help influence their culture... and hopefully over time, that'll lead to Iran's citizens demanding social changes in their nation.  Instead, what the US has often done, often at the behest of war mongers / moral absolutists is alienate nations we have disagreements with.\n\nAn example of a similar situation... there's a reason the US' political divide is getting more extreme.  When social media came around, people started using it to talk politics.  However, due to extreme disagreements, people began blocking people they knew who have political views they disagreed with. This lead to echo chambers forming, and each side continuously moving towards more extreme views, rather than having the other side around to argue the other side of the coin and temper those views, coming to a consensus and a middle ground.  Instead we got exaggerated tribalism where \"my side is always right, and your side is always wrong\".\n\nDivision, separation, and conflict doesn't balance our views... it makes them more extreme.  What you're arguing for will only make the situation worse.",

Similar to mental health institutions built in the West after World War 1, a lot of them have facilities for \"controversial\" therapy techniques like electro-shock therapy. \n\nSome of the better ones were built by charities. Some of the best medical facilities in Iran are doner/charity funded. It's not easy to get into those, and I doubt the government sends detainees to those places. \n\nAnd Of course, Iran has private mental health hospitals, which are mostly meant for drug rehabilitation. They tend to lean toward the expensive side. \n\nIranian government has a habit of sending people to mental institutions as a way of discrediting them. Especially political prisoners. Something as simple as a tattoo can be considered a sign of mental illness as far as the government is concerned. \n\nPrisoners who are sent to mental institutions don't usually stay there for long.

         "The reason they are saying it wasn't a lottery has to do with the requirements around sweepstakes versus a contest. Essentially the one they want to avoid is a sweepstakes/lottery, where there is random selection. Where random selection occurs there is more rigorous requirements from laws, such as alternative methods of entry. A contest on the other hand can have other rules, including the organization selecting the winners with intention. The difference between the two is nuanced, but essentially they are trying to argue this was a contest not a sweepstakes or lottery. Contests allow for it to be a qualified marketing expense to giveaway money, so long as there is not an equal chance of winning for every entrant. [https://nationalsweepstakescompany.com/blog/sweepstakes-vs-contest/](https://nationalsweepstakescompany.com/blog/sweepstakes-vs-contest/)\n\n  \nThe thing I don't think they did though was layout the requirements of how winners would be selected in advance. So they may still run afoul of the rules around contests. The thing is here though there are two sets of laws, one is around election interference, and then around sweepstakes/contests. I would argue that they have violated both, but election laws may carry more than civil penalties and fines. I would imagine the lawyer wants to keep this as close to a marketing campaign for Trump, and them just not following all of the rules they should have and end up paying a fine. The reality I hope for is there are some actual criminal charges, but we will have to wait and see.",

If they had insufficient evidence to convict the individual then the proper course is to drop the case. It isn't to try to get some level of 'justice' anyways. That isn't justice.

I understand it was Sheila's hair, the whole point is that her hair was in a place it reasonably should be and there seemingly was not anything that tied the vehicle to the murder. In fact it seems to be the opposite that there is testimony that excludes the vehicle from being the one used by the murderer.

I mean, I understand that, but if it dominates your thought process nonstop, law enforcement isn't the job for you.\n\nFrom the article: \nOfficer Adam Coy, who served nearly 20 years with the Columbus police force, shot Hill four times in a garage nearly four years ago. Coy, who is white, was fired after the shooting. He later told jurors that he thought Hill was holding a silver revolver.\n\n\u201cI thought I was going to die,\u201d he testified. It was only after he rolled over Hill\u2019s body and saw the keys that he realized there was no gun, Coy said. \u201cI knew at that point I made a mistake. I was horrified.\u201d",

If you can't definitively say your, or someone else's, life is actually in danger then you shouldn't be shooting. It's nuts to think \"split second decision\" is somehow a defense.\n\n> The officer\u2019s attorneys argued that Hill\u2019s lack of a weapon did not matter because Coy thought his life was in danger. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t reckless, he was reasonable,\u201d Collins said during the trial.\n\nJust for context, Hill was just sitting in his car. Some neighbor thought it was \"suspicious\" and called the non emergency line. Somehow this POS cop came to the conclusion Hill was robbing the place and had a gun. In actuality, Hill was visiting a friend's place. Oh and it's not even known of it was Hill's car that was reported as suspicious. Literally nothing about this was reasonable.\n\nAnd the cherry on top? They let him bleed out on the ground:\n\n> Video recordings from Coy and others show that none of the multiple officers on the scene made an attempt to render first aid to Hill until ten minutes after he was shot.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Andre_Hill",

We hold our bartenders to a higher standard, so why not the \"protect and serve\" city employees?",

Prosecutors asked that the former officer be sentenced immediately.

It doesn't add the courtroom bullshit or that the cop is being treated for treated for Hodgkin lymphoma, both trying to make you feel bad for the cop.\n\nI'll just copy the text.\n\n\n>Former police officer Adam Coy was found guilty of murder on Monday by a jury in the 2020 fatal shooting of Andre Hill, a 47-year-old unarmed Black man who was shot four times after the defendant ordered him to emerge from a darkened garage while holding a cellphone and a large set of keys.\n\n\n>The jury in the high-profile Franklin County Court of Common Pleas case announced its verdict after deliberating for about two-and-a-half days.\n\n\n>Besides murder, the jury also found Coy guilty of felonious assault and reckless homicide.\n\n\n>\"This verdict delivers a measure of justice for Andre Hill's family, who have waited nearly four years to see criminal accountability for his tragic and unnecessary death,\" national civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump, who represents Hill's family, said in a statement. \"Andre was an unarmed, innocent man, and his life was taken with disregard for the duty to protect and serve. Today\u2019s verdict underscores that no one is above the law, including those sworn to uphold it.\"\n\n\n>Crump added, \"We hope these verdicts bring some healing to the Hill family and send a powerful message: accountability in law enforcement is not optional.\"\n\n\n>Coy asserted during the trial that he feared for his life when he mistakenly believed Hill was leveling a silver revolver at him as he stepped out of the garage on Dec. 22, 2020. But the silver revolver Coy testified that he believed Hill was holding in his right hand turned out to be a set of silver keys.\n\n\n>\"I thought I was going to die,\" an emotional Coy, a former member of the Columbus Division of Police, testified last week.\n\n\n>Coy faces a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole. He is scheduled to be sentenced on Nov. 25.\n\n\n>After the verdict was announced just after noon local time, Judge Stephen L. McIntosh revoked Coy's $1 million bond and Coy was immediately taken into custody by court officers who led him out of the courtroom.\n\n>Coy was fired from the Columbus Police Department about a week after the shooting.\n\n>About a month after the shooting, Coy was arrested and indicted in the killing of Hill.\n\n>Coy did not turn on his body-worn camera until he shot Hill, but the device has a \"look-back\" function that automatically activated and recorded 60 seconds of the episode without sound, including capturing the shooting.\n\n\n>The body camera footage, which was played for the jury, also showed that as Hill lay dying on the floor of the garage, none of the officers who responded to the incident appeared to immediately provide first aid. The footage showed a woman coming out of the house and telling officers that Hill was a guest and that \"he was bringing me Christmas money. He didn't do anything.\"\n\n>The jury reached its decision after hearing closing arguments on Wednesday.\n\n>During his summation, Franklin County prosecutor Anthony Pierson told the jury that the evidence proved beyond reasonable doubt that Coy's use of deadly force was not justified, according to his training and national police standards.\n\n>\"This case isn't about someone who is resisting arrest, where officers pile on him, put a knee on him or something like that and he died,\" Pierson said. \"This case is not about someone who tells cops, 'I hate you. I'm going to shoot you,' It's not about that. It's about a man who was following police orders and was killed for it.\"\nMORE: Jurors in murder trial of former Ohio police officer offered contrasting theories in killing of Andre Hill\n\n>Coy's attorney, Mark Collins, slammed the state's case, saying prosecutors did not prove the charges beyond reasonable doubt.\n\n>\"We now know that the government's theory that somehow he [Coy] shot an unarmed man and made the entire thing up after the fact,\" Collins told the jurors, referring to Coy's claims of self-defense after wrongly believing he saw a gun in Hill's hand. \"But that's perverse ladies and gentlemen. That's desperate ladies and gentlemen. That's the government ladies and gentlemen.\"\n\n\n>Collins added, \"I'm surprised they didn't say that he planted the keys.\"\n\n>In May 2021, the City of Columbus agreed to a $10 million wrongful death settlement with Hill's family, the highest amount ever paid by the city.\n\n>The indictment of Coy in February 2021 came just days after the Columbus City Council also passed Andre's Law, which was named after Hill and requires Columbus police officers to turn on their body cameras when responding to calls and to immediately render first aid after a use-of-force incident.\n\n\nI think we know who the defense attorney is voting for.\n\n>Coy's attorney, Mark Collins, slammed the state's case, saying prosecutors did not prove the charges beyond reasonable doubt.\n\n>\"We now know that **the government**'s theory that somehow he [Coy] shot an unarmed man and made the entire thing up after the fact,\" Collins told the jurors, referring to Coy's claims of self-defense after wrongly believing he saw a gun in Hill's hand. \"But **that's perverse** ladies and gentlemen. **That's desperate** ladies and gentlemen. **That's the government ladies and gentlemen.\"**\n\nYeah, I do think he made up the I feared for my life story after the fact, he didn't even think his body cam caught the shooting because he didn't turn it on until after he shot him. But he didn't know the bodycam has a \"look-back\" function that automatically activates and recordes the 60 seconds before it's turned on, just without sound. \nThat video captured the shooting and what's probably got him convicted. \n\nAlso the feared for my life, they get 24 hours to meet with union reps and superiors before they have to give an official statement, where they have their union lawyer and union representative also sitting in. For context you get arrested and formally charged you must give your statement immediately.\n\nThat's why the few cops in the videos that cry and say things like I didn't know, or I'm sorry, or show a normal human response for killing an innocent person. Suddenly on their official statement they feared for their life or the life an safety of a colleague/civilian/rich white guys money. We could've lost all of them unless I shot and shot and shot and shot until my magazine was empty\n\n\n>**Collins added, \"I'm surprised they didn't say that he planted the keys.\"**\n\nWow, that's an experienced attorney everyone.",

Even that only happens when they do something so egregious that it causes public uproar, and they cannot sweep it under the rug successfully.\n\nWhen you peck at a problem that is systemic and entrenched, like police culture, you just end up grinding down your teeth without making a dent.",

Qualified immunity gives them leeway to employ that how they wish, with rare exception. \n\nErnesto Miranda learned this in 66, and took his case to the Supreme Court to give citizens SOME rights.  And yet, people argue with police and fight in the street instead of on the courts.\n\nWe will keep suing and fighting and draining these city resources until it\u2019s cheaper for them to hire and train proper de-escalators.",

Cops actually went through with receiving sexual services.\n\nAlso, I spent  2 1/2 years as a police reservist.  In my experience, cops can't keep their pants zipped up.  They screw police groupies, many screwed the same one.  One had a wife about to drop a baby in a month and was cheating on her.   I looked up to one of the officers who seemed to have his stuff together and seemed like a solid person.  Turned out he was screwing the dispatcher while his wife was undergoing treatment for blood cancer. \n\nAnother story is one screwed known local prostitute.  Other guys on the force found out about it, got stationary from the hospital and mailed the letter to him that the proustite had aids, named him as a John and that he should get checked.   They let him believe that for over a week before telling him.",

However, the Denton County District Attorney rejected all of those cases.\n\n\"The DA\u2019s office stated they were not able to prosecute these cases because the undercover officers had been engaging in inappropriate physical contact with the suspected prostitutes. I obtained the list of declined cases from the DA, and we immediately began an administrative review,\" Chief Rollins said.\n\nAn internal review found 13 Lewisville police officers violated the city and department's policy prohibiting physical contact once probable cause for a prostitution arrest has been established.\n\nIn other words, once the undercover officers agreed to pay for the sexual contact, probable cause was legally established, and no touching needed to occur.\n\nIn the end, three officers were fired, one was demoted, and seven were suspended without pay. Two were also given counseling, and several were reassigned from their undercover roles.\n\nThe department also had to return two seized vehicles and $247,807 in seized cash.\n\n\"To the residents of Lewisville, this entire incident is embarrassing and disappointing. As the Chief of Police for the Lewisville Police Department, it is my job to ensure the department operates with the utmost professionalism, integrity, and honor.

         "Hot take, this is an awful idea if done at scale. A lot of stuff is already priced ridiculously high according to what you can barely afford... what happens when a woman who's uneducated with maybe not even a high school diploma, has to turn to prostitution to pay the bills? And what happens when said prostitution industry becomes mainstream enough where a few big companies run the entire industry and lobby out anyone else? \n\nIt'll likely turn into the amateur acting, modeling, and music industry with extremely predatory and confining contracts. Once your sex life becomes a valid and marketable commodity, suddenly you can begin enforcing forced sex contracts, virginity contracts, chastity contracts... Look, I love chastity as a kink - it can be fun when both parties are consensually involved. But I genuinely fear that parents will start enforcing their childrens' virginity once it becomes lucrative, parents grooming their children to become popular stars... but instead of of stars, it's just being a contracted five-star prostitute.\n\nHonestly I'm fine with the status quo but that's just my potentially biased perspective - not ridiculously heinous as long as you're not bragging everywhere, but also not mainstream enough where everyone wants a piece of the pie. It's already not bad since women have a reasonable amount of freedom to run OnlyFans / other sex work on their own (other than credit card companies trying to ruin the fun) even though there's still some shaming. But trying to institutionalize this would strip all the freedom from them.\n\nI would like to hope that this doesn't happen - but given the current trend of politics with abortion rights being taken away from women, I don't doubt that there would be people who would ***wholeheartedly support*** selling off their children or wives into prostitution.",

You are calling him a regional premier, but he is literally the [President of the Valencian government](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_Valencian_Government).\n\n\nThe regional authorities literally do not have the authority to issue alerts to the public, that is the responsibility of each region, and the regions send alerts to their citizens. For comparison, saying 'the Spanish government' should have sent the alerts is like saying the EU should have made a broadcast on French TV, or that the United Nations should stop false election posts in the USA.\u00a0\n\n\nThere are decisions that bodies can make and pass down, urging the relevant authorities to act, but if they don't have the legal authority (or means) to somehow leapfrog the authorities below them, it's absurd to say they're responsible.\n\n\n\n\nIt's also worth noting that Valencia is one of the regions in Spain that does not have a hugely active independence movement, and seems reasonably content to be part of Spain (whereas a majority of Spain has independence referendums every few years which are ignored). The local government is of a very, very different ideology from the main government, decided last year to disband the regional emergency response teams, and the president spent the day before the flood receiving alerts and making public statements like 'The worst of the storm seems to have passed' and 'we are in no danger'.\n\n\n\n\nSo it's incredibly disengenuous to say it has anything to do with the local government and to brush off the regional governments responsibility, especially in this rare case when the people have voted for the existing powers of local and national government responsibilities.\n\n\nNow that's got nothing to do with the royal family, but it's not the first time a right-wing nationalist party has screwed up and the people who voted for them have blamed a random figurehead.",

It wouldn't have prevented the tragedy, but it would have sped up the relief efforts, which is the current criticism against the central government (barring conspiracy theories, of course).\n\n\nThe problem seems to be, as you say, partisanism. Last time the central government used this national emergency measure (during COVID), it was criticised by opposition parties and regional governments, and it didn't fare well at courts. So now it's a game of chicken in which the central governmet won't declare the \"state of alarm\" unless the regional government asks for it (to shield itself from future criticism), and the regional government won't ask for it because it'd admit to being incompetent.\n\n\nAnd meanwhile, people suffer.",

         "My Quincy Jones story - in 1986 I was 14 and I visited my older brother who was living/working in downtown LA (we were from the rural mid-west).  Since I was a basic bitch I was a huge Lakers fan at the time (Kareem, Magic, etc) and my brother took me to a game at the Forum.  About half-way through the second quarter during a time-out, my brother said, \"Come on, we're upgrading\".  We walked down to the floor, directly behind the Lakers' bench (3 ft from KAJ!), passing right in front of Jack Nicholson!, and grabbed a couple of seats in the 2nd or 3rd row mid-court behind the Lakers' bench.  When I asked whose seats these were, the only thing my brother said was, \"Be cool.\"  So I enjoyed the game.  At half-time, the lady seated next to me starting talking to me.  She eventually asked, \"So how do you guys know Quincy?\"  I just mumbled something about my brother working for IBM (which he did) and she moved on.  Even little old rural me knew that there was only one Quincy who had season tix to seats like these.  I spent the rest of the game enjoying myself but more than a little scared that the night would end with Quincy Jones hollering at me.  But he never showed and at the end of the game the lady next to me said, \"Say hi to Quincy!\"\n\nThanks Quincy for all the music etc and the great seats for 2/3 of a Lakers game in 1986!",

         "A twisted attempt at political commentary hasn\u2019t sat well with parents in Calgary\u2019s Bowness, who are outraged after someone left a bowl of disposable razors out for children on Halloween.\n\nThe bowl of blue razors left outside a home was accompanied by a note that took a jab at Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\n\n\u201cSorry we can\u2019t afford apples this year because of Trudeau. So this year just razors,\u201d the note reads.\n\nFortunately, a mother who spoke to 660 NewsRadio under the condition of anonymity, says she was beside her children when her children innocently plunged their hands into the bowl. She quickly told them to put the dangerous blades back.\n\nShe says she couldn\u2019t believe someone would pull such a potentially dangerous stunt.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never ever seen that before. You hear of stories \u2026 with pins or razors or whatever, but I\u2019ve never come across something like that,\u201d she said.\n\nShe says people are free to have their say about political leaders, but ought to leave kids out of it.\n\n\u201cIt was unnecessary, political views have nothing to do with kids having fun on Halloween,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThat could be something that could be on your end, whether it be dark humour or sick jokes \u2014 whatever. Kids are out to have fun.\u201d\n\nThe incident was reported to police, who confirmed to 660 NewsRadio they received a report about a bowl of disposable shaving razors left out for trick-or-treaters.\n\nThey say there is not enough evidence at this time to indicate a criminal offence occurred.",

         "I made decorations for a Halloween party one year. One of the centerpieces for the tables was based on Sweeney Todd, and included a straight razor. Knowing people would be drinking at the party, despite the fact that the razor was going to be glued in place, I spent an hour figuring out how to dull the blade and checking that no part of it could cut tissue paper.\u00a0\n\n\nIt felt like overkill, but I couldn't get the image out of my head of somebody checking if it was a real blade and somehow slicing the tip of their finger off trying to pry it from the base.\u00a0\n\n\nAt the end of the night, when we were cleaning up, the razor was sitting on the table, next to the centerpiece.\u00a0\n\n\nIf children had access to the bowl, trusting the little plastic covers to keep them safe is absolutely ridiculous.\u00a0",

E.g having an unstable pile of logs on your property that a kid might be tempted to climb.\n\nThis razor blade thing would qualify but I think it\u2019s even more egregious because it\u2019s Halloween.

The absurdity is meant to be funny.\u00a0\n\n\nIt would be like a cartoon of a slot machine in a casino with a sign that says \"sorry, out of order, please leave coins with cashier\" (or something funnier).

         "Article Text:\n\nBEIJING (AP) \u2014 Three Chinese astronauts returned to Earth on Monday after a six-month stay on the Tiangong space station, part of China\u2019s effort to be a global leader in space exploration.\n\nA parachute slowed their capsule\u2019s nighttime descent to a remote landing area in China\u2019s Inner Mongolia region. The crew emerged after touching down at 1:24 a.m. A Chinese national flag stuck in the ground near the capsule flapped in the wind.\n\nIn recent years, the country\u2019s space program has brought back rocks from the moon and landed a rover on Mars. It aims to put a person on the moon by 2030, which would make China the second nation after the United States to do so.\n\nThe space station astronauts returned after welcoming a replacement three-person crew last week for the latest six-month mission. The new team of one woman and two men will conduct experiments, carry out spacewalks and install equipment to protect the station from space debris.\n\nA space agency official said in April that Tiangong had maneuvered several times to avoid debris and had partially lost power when the solar wing\u2019s power cables were hit by debris, according to a report from the official Xinhua News Agency.\n\nChina is among the countries that have created space debris, including the reported break-up of a rocket stage in August during the launch of the first 18 satellites for a global internet service similar to Starlink, the still-growing constellation of satellites operated by Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX.\n\nTiangong, which means Heavenly Palace, was completed two years ago and orbits the earth.\n\nOnly Chinese astronauts have gone to the space station so far, but a space agency spokesperson said last week that China is in discussions to select and train astronauts from other nations to join the missions, Xinhua reported.\n\nAstronauts from several nations have traveled to the International Space Station, but China is blocked from that program mainly because of U.S. concerns over the military\u2019s involvement in China\u2019s space program.\n\nChina laid out an ambitious plan last month to become a leader in space science research by 2050 in conjunction with its advances in space exploration.",

It merely allows Iowa to require some voters to submit a provisional ballot which will be counted when the propriety of their voting is established.  Yes it's an inconvenience, but it's not a deprivation of rights.\n\nThe political reason I like it is that it is going to blow up in Republicans' faces when they find NO NONCITIZENS TRYING TO VOTE.  They've made their hunt public and now they'll have to tell us what they find.  It's the best proof there is that there is no issue with noncitizens voting.\n\nThe philosphical reason I like it is that it is a decision in favor of the Republicans' position by a judge appointed by Joe Biden.

The category also includes certain stimulants, sedatives and opioids.\n> \n> It\u2019s the first time a state has classified abortion pills as controlled substances.\u00a0\n> \n> The new lawsuit, filed Thursday, alleges that the law could create barriers for health care workers who need to administer mifepristone and misoprostol quickly in an emergency, thereby delaying patients\u2019 access to the pills and creating a risk of harm. The complaint also says the law discriminates against people who need the medications, since patients with similarly severe medical needs aren\u2019t subject to the same delays if they need other drugs. It seeks to prevent the law from being enforced.\n> \n> According to the American College of Medical Toxicology, mifepristone and misoprostol do not meet the definition of a controlled substance.

         "I think there might be a mistranslation there. The eruption was big, but not that big. Like maybe very low end VEI3 Vulcanian eruption from what I understand for this specific paroxysm. Unless these houses were in a river valley and hit by a lahar due to rain after the eruption, it does not appear that that much material was actually released.\n\nFor reference, the eruption of the Ruang volcano earlier this year, also in Indonesia, emitted 3 separate pulses, one of those was VEI3, and the other 2 were Plinian VEI4, the entire eruptive sequence was a VEI5 eruption. This was a much, much larger eruption, producing much more volcanic debris. The eruption plume from both large VEI4 pulses was over 25 kilometers. Yet, it resulted in only a few inches of accumulated ash 4KM away on the neighboring Tahulandang.\n\nPutting this in scale, the Lewotobi eruption ejected between 10 and 100x less tephra compared to Ruang. Considering the stated plume height of only 2 kilometers, I would put it on the smaller side of that so closer to 100x smaller than Ruang's eruption.\n\nThis being a mistranslation also matches up with the pictures I have seen of the aftermath of this eruption.\n\nhttps://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2182153098.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill/f_webp\n\nhttps://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2182149018.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill/f_webp\n\nhttps://static.dw.com/image/70679718_1006.jpg\n\nhttps://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/8597/live/f203b220-9a7e-11ef-8db6-ef78bfd874ce.jpg.webp",

My mom is actually really awesome and cares a lot about people. Our town hired the county sherif for whatever was needed. We had a young couple move in on a Thursday with three young puppies. By Friday he was dead and she was in the hospital on life support due to a car accident they were in in New Hampshire. Town found out Saturday morning. We called the sherif who told us no one would be around until Monday. We got in touch with the hospital who was able to find out the code on the house had not been changed yet and we were able to get inside.\n\nWe spent a week taking care of those puppies.\n\nWe found out later that the sherif animal control officer was off that weekend, but THEY NEVER BOTHERED TO INFORM HER AT ALL. She was livid, and we dropped the sherif contract. The one fucking time we needed them and all they had to do was take care of three cute as hell puppies and they couldn't be bothered to do their bare minimum.\n\nGood news on the puppies, the owner was being transferred down to Florida where here extended family lives, and the puppy breeder happened to be up in New York and was driving back down to Florida, so they went with her to the owners sisters house. There was no way in hell we were going to let her lose those dogs, and with her help we managed to get them home.",

We have a very loving friendship, and I have an awesome younger half-brother and a wonderful man who, though not technically a 'stepfather', is a loving dad-like person.  I and my adopted half-brother were SOOOOO fortunate to grow up in a loving, safe family.  Birth mom and adoptive mom (now in her 90's) have met, got on like gangbusters, and truly love/appreciate each other.  Yes, I'm a lucky child.\n\nMy birth father, otoh, was a piece of work, and I never got to know him.  Thank goodness I'm on the west coast and he stayed on the east when my mom, in a panic over her pregnancy, moved across the country.  \n\nTalked to him one time on the phone before he died.  He was near senile, and told long, drawn-out stories about HIMSELF, all colored to make him look good, especially financially.  I respected his wish that I not inform his other kids.\n\nBut my half-sister contacted me shortly thereafter via Ancestry after receiving the surprise that she had an unknown half-sister.  We've formed a good connection although we live states away.  Early on, she informed me that \"our dad\" had molested her and her young aunt when they were pre-teens, and had tried to do the same with our younger sister.  He also fancied himself to be a 'financial genius' and proceeded to lose any money the family could acquire.  Never actually had a real job.  The four kids had to share one room in a rental home (the other two bedrooms were for him and his wife, and his 'office').  They had one old car.  They lived in that place from 1964 until this year, always renting.  His wife (whom he impregnated at age 18), went to work and had a good 401K.  He took over the 'investment' and when he died they discovered that the money was gone.  You can't make this stuff up. Ironically, wife decided to stay with him after the abuse came out when my half-sister was in her late 30's.  If she had decided to dump him, she might have a more comfortable retirement today.\n\nSo yeah - 'family' is the people who love you, blood or no.  And sometimes life protects us in unusual ways.",

A study published in January 2024 estimated that, during the 16 months following Texas' implementation of a total abortion ban in June 2022, there were approximately 26,313 pregnancies resulting from rape in the state. \n\nIt's important to note that this figure represents the estimated number of pregnancies resulting from rape, not the number of births. The study did not specify how many of these pregnancies were carried to term, terminated through legal or illegal means, or ended in miscarriage.

How does that make you feel? Shouldn't we be attempting to combat that? Why is being told something unfavorable instantly seen as an attack these days? \n\nMarches and protests only work when they generate visibility.

You end up just preaching to the choir and that isn't what we want here. \n\nGetting a 37 second clip on CNN, that is only brought up once in 24 hours is a slap in the face to you, me and everyone in this nation.\n\nThis should piss you off, this should make you even angrier than you were in the first place. I know the march is something that made you feel good, made you feel like you are making an impact and my informing you that it didn't hurts but that doesn't change the truth and if we aren't willing to address this monumental problem as a result... we'll just keep spinning our wheels.  \n\nYou marched because you want to be heard, don't shoot the messenger telling you the other side didn't even get a chance to listen because you were silenced. \n\nWe can keep focusing only on the big umbrella issues and keep getting nowhere, or we can collectively turn out attention to the press and hold their feet to the fire like we should have 30 years ago. Yes coverage of the protests/marches/town halls etc would be boring and get less ratings but dammit this country needs some ability to mobilize restored. \n\nWe are all in the same boat in this regard, no matter what your specific beliefs are, we all need to have the confidence that our voices have power and currently they no longer do no matter what you are saying. \n\nIf you can't see how that is a problem, if your instinct is to simply downvote me and disregard anything I say simply because it doesn't appear to support your view... why would you expect anything different from the opposite side? \n\nI'm sorry to rain on the parade but I want your message to not only be heard, I want it to be powerful.",
         "Here's the NBC report the data first came out: [https://www.nbcnews.com/health/womens-health/texas-abortion-ban-deaths-pregnant-women-sb8-analysis-rcna171631](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/womens-health/texas-abortion-ban-deaths-pregnant-women-sb8-analysis-rcna171631)\n\nAnd here is the report from the Gender Equity Policy Institute who initially released that data and contacted NBC: [https://thegepi.org/state-of-reproductive-health-united-states/](https://thegepi.org/state-of-reproductive-health-united-states/)\n\nYou can download the full report at that 2nd link. It states that less than 10% of the US lives in Texas (men included, please note that), and 1 in 7 of the entire country's maternal deaths happen in Texas\u2013 that's over 14%. That's insane! \n\nI had a full post typed up that delved into some of the reasons for this, largely pertaining to miscarriage treatment, but it ended up not posting so here is the less detailed version... 10-20% of pregnancies end in miscarriage\u2013 that number is hard to narrow down on because many miscarriages happen before women know they're pregnant, so it may even be higher. Regardless, that's a crazy amount of women potentially impacted, potentially denied treatment for their miscarriage due to the law or fear for legal repercussion. Miscarriage can quickly lead to infection if not properly treated, and treatment often relies on the same procedures used for abortion. You can see how a doctor's hands could be tied up. And miscarriage isn't even the only reason for maternal mortality. Pregnancy is dangerous. Abortion can 100% be necessary to save a woman's life. Don't be selfish when you go to vote on Tuesday; abortion ban can and will affect someone in your life if it hasn't already.",

Pets are considered property so it\u2019s difficult to get more than that.

Jail is not on the radar for this since they had a warrant.\n\nAs part of discovery, Shasta County has to turn over relevant information about the case to opposing counsel. They want to keep Cedar\u2019s fate a secret. In other words, Shasta County is rejecting the authority of the court of law. **The penalties for killing a goat are one thing, the penalty for telling a judge to F themselves is another.**\n\nThe prosecution isn\u2019t stupid. They know the same thing. They know that the defense is going to jail unless the case is dropped, and defense doesn\u2019t want jail. Not only that, putting the defense in jail is cheap. They don\u2019t even need to go to trial.\n\nShasta County basically has only one way out of this mess. Money. Lots and lots of money. More money than a jury could possibly force them to pay.

         "A 9-year-old girl who fell in love with the goat she raised for the Shasta District Fair was heartbroken when deputies, wielding a search warrant, confiscated the furry livestock, taking him away to be butchered.\n\nTwo years after the scandal erupted, Shasta County has agreed to pay $300,000 to the girl\u2019s family to settle the legal dispute over the floppy-eared brown-and-white goat named Cedar.\n\nThe young girl had raised the goat for the 2022 fair, as part of a program intended to teach youngsters how to care for farm animals. But when it came time to sell Cedar and turn him over to be butchered, Jessica Long\u2019s 9-year-old daughter couldn\u2019t do it.\n\nLong took the goat away from the fair, offered to pay for the costs, and pleaded with fair officials to let her daughter keep Cedar. Instead, the Shasta County Sheriff\u2019s Office deployed deputies, search warrant in hand, to drive hundreds of miles across Northern California to find and take the goat from Billy\u2019s Mini Farm, where Long had taken him until the dispute was resolved.\n\nIt is not clear who contacted and instructed the sheriff\u2019s office to get involved.\n\nThe case caused an uproar and, in a federal lawsuit, Long and her daughter alleged deputies wrongfully took out a search warrant, seized Cedar, and turned the animal over to fair officials. Attorneys also accused county and fair officials of using law enforcement to intervene in what they said was a legal civil dispute over who owned the goat.\n\nCedar, who was bought at the county fair for $902, was butchered, but it remains unclear who did it.\n\nOn Friday, U.S. District Judge Dale A. Drozd approved the settlement that requires Shasta County to pay $300,000 to Long and her daughter to settle the federal suit out of court.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, this litigation cannot bring Cedar home,\u201d said Vanessa Shakib, an attorney representing Long. \u201cBut the $300,000 settlement with the County of Shasta and Shasta County Sheriff\u2019s Office is the first step forward.\u201d\n\nThe settlement brings about a partial end to what has been two years of contentious litigation between Long and Shasta County and fair officials.\n\nDuring the last two years, Shakib said fair and county officials have engaged in \u201cobstructionist discovery tactics\u201d to avoid answering key questions about happened to the goat, and what role officials played in seizing and destroying the animal.\n\n\u201cYears later this case still has several unanswered questions,\u201d she said.\n\nAfter two years of reviewing texts, emails, phone records and depositions, Shakib said county and fair officials have yet to make clear who butchered Cedar, what happened to his meat and who got sheriff deputies involved in the dispute.\n\nText messages uncovered during the federal lawsuit suggests fair officials wanted to keep secret what happened to Cedar and who was involved.\n\n\u201cKathy said ok but no one needs to know about this,\u201d B.J.

Long and her attorney reached out before the goat was butchered and told sheriff, fair and county officials they were disputing ownership of the goat.\n\nStill, someone decided to order that Cedar be seized and killed despite knowing a lawsuit was incoming, Shakib said.\n\nCounty officials deny any wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cThe County did nothing wrong, but we recognize the risk and cost involved in going to trial, and so we agreed to settle the case,\u201d Christopher Pisano, an attorney for Shasta County, said in an email. \u201cWe are happy to be moving on and putting this case behind us.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Shasta County did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Silva, who still serves as CEO for the Shasta District Fair, also did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nDespite the partial settlement with Shasta County and the Shasta County Sheriff\u2019s Office, the lawsuit is still ongoing.

My family and I are very involved in animal rescue and I've seen too many animals intentionally harmed by other people. It happens constantly, and entirely too many of those people are actually proud of themselves. They claim to be defending their 'way of life' from radical liberals that want everyone to eat soy burgers. There's a religious component too, of course. It varies from 'humans are more important than animals' to 'everything on earth is here for us to use.' I hate them all. I truly hate them. There are a few people willing to push back, but that isn't easy. It's almost impossible to interfere legally, and very few people will risk doing anything illegal. \"Very few' isn't zero though. Some of us are willing to do whatever we can when we see an opportunity.\n\n Laws to protect animal welfare can actually be a problem in some situations. We have to be very vigilant here because our state laws can be manipulated without too much trouble.  its easy to use laws that were meant to protect animals to cause harm instead.  Its not hard to seize animals (and kill them) under the pretense of protecting them from abuse or neglect. That couldn't happen if killing animals wasn't considered an acceptable solution, but it is. Just as an example, Amish puppy mills are a big problem in this state. When new laws started cracking down on breeders, many operations chose to kill their animals instead of letting rescue groups take them. The Amish were the worst, but they weren't the only ones that killed the animals out of spite rather than let them be adopted. It was all perfectly legal.",

Research is another story, with some far stronger than others, but *in general* a degree from one is much the the same as another.\n\nBut to answer your question, private universities *can* charge whatever they want. They don't use the HECS system, but students can still get government loans to cover some or all of the fees up to a certain amount (around $120k I believe).

If you go to school for social work and end up working a trades, it won't feel like a waste of money since it wouldn't cost anything.

Australians and New Zealanders have TAFEs or polytechnic schools, basically trade schools where you can study more hands on skills such as mechanics, hospitality, and administration/accounting. And there is plenty of employment for those who simply choose to direct employment after school. University is pursued because your career choice requires a bachelor's degree - for example: teaching, law, medicine, psychology, and journalism. Unlike US college where your study is more open with majors and minors and you attend post graduate for things like medicine or law - the Australian and New Zealand Universities are set up so your study is specialized in your career path from the beginning (with the exception of Bachelor or Arts or Social Sciences - which are more broad in nature but can lead to more varied career possibilties). So if you go to University to be a teacher- then every paper/subject except for the possible odd elective subject - is focused on you training to be a teacher.",

Because expanding enrollments has its own consequences, like greater competition for housing (LA isn't known for housing affordability), lowered ability to provide an education due to excessive class sizes, and straining the infrastructure in and around the campus. \n\n>rather than putting endowments on the stock market like a corporate pension\n\nAnd if private businesses can list on the market, and the expectation is that higher education won't become a public service, then it should absolutely be allowed for them to.",

Most large population centers, like Detroit, are served by multiple agencies. If only some of them report and some do not, it has a massive negative impact on the local agencies ability to request funding. This is considerably less impactful for very small rural communities, who can experience more temporary spikes in criminal activity, so accurate reporting is less important for funding, but the reporting itself can have a much more negative impact locally.

If it's 5 murders and your population is 1,000,000 people, you'd report it as .5 murders per 1000,000 residents. If it's 5 murders and your population is 10,000, you'd report it as 50 murders per 100,000 residents. In each of these three regions, the total number of murders hasn't changed. This gives us a method to compare 'how likely is this to happen to you' between different regions. You have a much greater chance (albeit still pretty small) of being murdered in the third example (the 10,000 residence one) than you do in the second example (the 1,000,000 residence one).\n\nUsually, when a population center suffers from a decline in population, crime rates increase. Business close, less opportunities for gainful employment exist, profit margins for companies of all sizes diminish, etc.",

         "Y'all aren't wrong about the drop in quality and the drive for short term profits, but you are being simplistic and missing part of the probable why. \n\nYes, there was a time when these huge chains had good food etc. They grew and profited in an era where local restaurants and bars tended to have shitty food and where being able to get the same menu cooked to a minimum standard in any city in America was a draw, something that large numbers of customers wanted. However, that era is long dead. \n\nSometime in the 90's and 2000s, local restaurants and bars that were actually good started being a thing. Then they become the norm. Probably not coincidentally, it became possible to use the Internet and mapping services to find restaurants in a given area, along with customer reviews - meaning even non-locals could find the local places that were worth going to. People who wanted good food didn't go to Fridays anymore rather than risk an unknown local place that was probably shit - they googled local gastro pubs and went there. \n\nAt some point, the writing was on the wall. Nothing these places did was going to complete with local + quality + a consumer culture that valued those things over national chains. Their base of loyal customers existed, but was going to die off, and they were not going to get replaced. \n\nAt this point, the goal of the companies changed from growing and maintaining market share, to making as much money as possible before they inevitably went bankrupt. Either they did this knowingly, or they floundered until the owners cashed out by selling to venture capitalists, who did have that goal. At which point the enshitification cycle started. They weren't going to out compete for customers who wanted good food, so they dropped food quality a little to save money. After this started having a negative impact, they dropped prices to match, and leaned into that marketing. Once they got a spike in customers from that, they dropped food quality again. Rinse repeat, close stores as necessary, and eventually go bankrupt - but that was always going to happen; the only questions were \"when\" and \"how much money can be made first.\"",

Eventually this will drive away the customer base and now you're in a spiral that can never be recovered from. Because the only way to fix it is to take a hit on profits in order to increase quality, but corporations simply won't ever do that.

They buy a restaurant with a good concept, promote franchises, then it runs its course as people's tastes change, they load it with debt, kill it, and start over. It's the circle of life\n\nAlso a few of them do seem to be doing better than others. They built a completely new free-standing Chili's from the ground up which I swear was no longer happening, and I also saw a completely new free-standing Outback Steakhouse too.

The went from reliably good, to reliably ok, to crap.\n\nAt the same time. the internet and smartphones became ubiquitous, we all have the internet with us at all times and no matter where we are, we can find plenty of locally owned restaurants with plenty of reviews to reliably pick a good place to go. And the cheap chains have gotten more expensive, so the price difference to go for higher quality is less. I really can't grasp going to any of the national chains over a local place anymore.",

They trade in premium mediocrity and, more often than not, because of their enormous scale, the quality and experience is awful compared to the price.

Then it was another 10 before they came to take the food order, and over an hour to receive our plates. \n\nDuring that time I saw staff standing around, messing around on their phones, and even stepping outside for a smoke.

Maybe it\u2019s a franchise and the individual owner eventually does it, maybe they\u2019re publicly traded and the shareholders eventually demand it, maybe a PE firm takes them private and does it. Ultimately if you\u2019re a shitty business being propped up by good real estate, the eventual tide of things leads you to shut down the shitty part of the business.\n\nAnd that\u2019s obviously good, right?

Over here in Taiwan there's restaurants where you literally never interact with the server other than when they bring you food - get a table number from a machine out front, order via QR code, either pay online or pay right when the food is delivered, and you can leave when you're ready.

The only other option is to reduce food costs or labor costs. That means worse food or worse service, period. \n\nYou can't avoid this in the restaurant business. If you try to go too cheap on either side, local businesses will push you out because it is easy and cheap for them to do so while still making a profit even if that might be overall less than yours in theory. That's what all of the chain places are experiencing now. Very few are adapting, but the reality is because they can't. \n\nAs a corporation, they have to keep growing, and, there, is just always a low cap in restaurants more than other industries. So they are fucked.",
         "I think 20 to 30 years ago, food trends and market needs or desires allowed these types of places to flourish.  If you think about it, food diversity, availability, etc. was a lot lower in the 90s and even aughts.  Today, however, there are not only additional types of restaurants serving varieties of ethnic and/or \"craft\" foods, there are also a lot more places to eat, in general, so the viability of generic franchises serving standard - and not particularly delicious - \"American\" cuisine is in a lot lower demand.\n\nTastes have changed considerably over time.  In the 90s, I remember thinking a place like Red Lobster or Olive Garden was an exotic experience.  Granted, I was a kid so my frame of reference was narrow, but the perception of food was different, though I suppose that would somewhat depend on where you grew up.\n\nSome of that is not only exposure to various cuisines, but also the expansion of food \"culture,\" for instance.  Think of all the food programming available and how that has influenced people's tastes and desires.  Food Network was a big part of that, but even now Instagram and YouTube have further expanded a foodie culture.\n\nThe expanse of knowledge has led to people seeking out new and more satisfying experiences, or even being able to cook more elaborate meals at home.  This makes a lot of bland restaurants obsolete.  Things that were exotic or unique 30 years ago are no longer that interesting.  In some cases these restaurants haven't adapted to changes in that landscape, but in others there's not much you can do but become outmoded and fade out.",

Is it worth that gamble?\n\n\\-----\n\n**The BETTER way to look at it is \"how close is the plea deal to a full sentence?\".  Because:**\n\n* 1a)  If the plea deal and a guilty verdict are equal punishment, the alleged criminal will never take the plea unless they're wracked with guilt (basically turning themselves in) and don't care about a trial.\n* 1b)  If the perp never takes the plea, the DA's office spends a ton of money taking every single case to trial.\n* 2a)  If the plea deal is tiny (let's say 1% or less of the full sentence), the alleged would take the plea deal basically every single time, unless they are actually innocent, and absolutely certain that they can prove it in court.\n* 2b)  If every perp takes a plea deal, the DA's office gets ripped apart because nobody is doing any time, and they're all getting off with barely worse than a warning (20 year murder charge, 1% of that is 2.5 months).\n\nSo, obviously, the \"best\" plea deal arrangements are somewhere in between.  Where the state office can save money, and the criminal can get a slightly reduced sentence.  Where this lands depends on what the DA thinks they can get away with.\n\nIf you offer a perp a plea deal at 75% of the guilty verdict, they'll only take it if they're sure they're going to be found guilty anyways.\n\nBut you want perps who think they may have a chance to make plea deals too.  So you, as the DA, look at the case you have, you figure how 'slam dunk' it is, and you offer a plea deal that makes the alleged criminal contemplate whether to take it.  You don't want to offer a plea so punishing that they never take it, and you don't want to offer one so light that they snap it up.\n\n**So, as an outside observer, the severity of the plea deal's punishment is directly correlated with how strong of a case the DA & police had against the defendant.**\n\nIt has nothing to do with whether the alleged criminal thinks they can walk.  It has everything to do with whether the DA thinks the alleged can walk.",

         "Why would they kill it",
         "I've read the article and a few others, and I need some sources for the timeline of this to corroborate what folks have been saying in the comments.\n\nThe dude who owned the squirrel found it about 7 years ago and tried to rehab and release it, but it ended up already being habituated to humans and stayed since it lacked survival skills\n\nThe couple started up their animal sanctuary last year in the town where this took place.\n\nThe raid happened Oct 30th and the squirrel was euthanized shortly afterwards due to biting someone during the raid (which was 6 Department of Environmental Conservation) officers.\n\nQuestion 1. A bunch of comments have been saying the guy had years to get the permits for the squirrel and had multiple warnings over said years to get them but didn't. So far, none of the articles I've read mentioned this, so did he have multiple notices and warnings over the years? Most mentioned he was in the process of filing the paperwork when the raid happened, but nothing is said about warnings or notices.\n\nQuestion 2. What exactly is the timeline for when the paperwork was being filed to when the raid happened? The guy who owned the squirrel makes it sound like he'd been working to try and get the right forms done but was having problems and the DEC was dragging their heels. However, considering the sanctuary only got started last year, is that when he started working the forms, or was it only more recently when they stated getting more publicity?\n\nQuestion 3. Was the DEC just there for the squirrel and raccoon (the other animal taken), or were they there for a broader inspection and search? On top of that what is the normal protocol for an inspection like this?\n\nQuestion 4. Was it just the paperwork for the squirrel that wasn't there, or were there more permitting errors on top of that? The DEC in the article mentioned the confiscation/inspection/raid came because of anonymous concerns sent to the office, but unless this guy literally had no paperwork filed with the state, I can't imagine the DEC wasn't aware of his operations. So did he file the right paperwork to make an animal sanctuary in the way he wanted it with the exotic animals in mind (while they are common wildlife, squirrels and raccoons are classified as exotic pets) or did he file more basic paperwork for starting an animal sanctuary and neglected to mention the exotic animals?\n\nSo far, again the sources are only giving the wavetops of this case and in something like this where a cute animal was euthanized folks are acting pretty emotionally charged on the comments.\n\n*edited for a couple of mispellings and the 4th question.*",

If the owner declines, dogs and cats need a strict 4-month quarantine, and ferrets need strict 6-month quarantine. They also need immediate rabies vaccination. Demonstrating an adequate serological response to vaccination may result in health officials reducing the quarantine period. Quarantine should be conducted in a secure facility that ensures people and other animals do not become exposed.\n\n>**Livestock:**\n>Unvaccinated livestock should be euthanized or kept under strict quarantine for 4 - 6 months after a rabies exposure. Unvaccinated livestock with a high-risk exposure to rabies should not be sold and products from these animals (meat, milk) should not be consumed during this quarantine period.\n\n>**Other mammals:**\n>Other mammals should be euthanized immediately.\n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/rabies/hcp/veterinarians/index.html",

A warning perhaps would be appropriate after all the years he looked after these animals and 300 others. I just find it sick that the government did this. What benefit to society was it to go, take the animals away, and then kill them? To prove a point? It is illogical to me. This is my frustration\u2026 I hope that makes sense \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb",
