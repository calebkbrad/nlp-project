It\u2019ll be onto the next useful idiot, and planned executions and strategies on media creation and injection into our platforms. The advent of generative AI is here to amplify these effects. No one enjoying or developing  this tech is feeling any sort of obligation or accountability to address or even talk about this, and even less so willing to take a moment out of their day to consider the reality of what 4 years from now may look like as it continues to rapidly advance. It\u2019s going to get way worse, pioneers in this space are willfully ignorant of the new vectors they are handing over *for free* to be used in bad faith by hostile nation states. The amount of uphill battle and deprogramming of now batshit insane Americans feels like an impossible task, but maybe there is a fucking chance that we can start tipping needles back in Americas favor if we can stop pretending like there aren\u2019t technological or legal solutions for this bullshit.

Hence, a draw. Especially because of the third point, the War of 1812 was pretty much the end of any non-native support for the tribes against the US, and from then on most colonial/native conflict was sporadic battles and guerilla stuff rather than proper pitched battles and stately warfare.\n\n Though it's worth noting it's not clear exactly how much the US actually wanted Canada, and how much it was a bargaining/\"haggling\" play - \"we'll relinquish our claim on Canada if you stop giving Tecumseh guns\" kind of thing.

She looked like a walking sex doll with bottle blonde hair, fake injected lips, red bustier, skin tight jeans and red pumps. He sees the line and gets a look of disgust. He made inquiries to the workers regarding the situation, said a few words I didn\u2019t catch, and walked off in a huff at the response. She tottered after him pulling on his sleeve to get in line but he literally brushed her off and kept walking. \n\nLater losers!!",

He was 95.\n\nThe Home Depot didn\u2019t immediately respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment.\n\nMarcus, who had a net worth of about $7.4 billion, according to Bloomberg\u2019s Billionaire Index, gained his fortune from establishing the Home Depot with Arthur Blank in 1978. The duo grew the orange-clad retailer into a retail behemoth that now has 2,300 stores and a stock market valuation of nearly $400 billion.\n\nMarcus was Home Depot\u2019s CEO until 1997 and served as the company\u2019s chairman until his retirement in 2002.",

I dry rubbed them basically with just salt and pepper, seared them on both sides over a high flame, then popped them into the oven at 450 until the center got to 135.\n\nSo, the reason why I am posting is I think this was a little too done.  I mean, the flavor was great, and they weren't dry, but the texture had just gone a bit harder than I was hoping, and the meat in the center looked like it *just* turned from pink.\n\nWhat do you guys prefer?  Everything I see online says pull pork at 140, should I have pulled them at 130?  125?\n\nSince it was on cast iron, maybe the residual heat from the pan kept it cooking after I pulled it?

The reasons are many and complex, but much of it is due to the disappearance of old-growth forests and the increased reliance on tree farms with much younger trees. In the 1940s, most construction lumber was cut from trees that were decades old, today they may be as young as 9 years old. As a result, the 2x4s in the commons bin in a typical American lumberyard are cut from small, fast-growing trees, mostly \"white wood\" (SPF on the stamp, spruce, pine, fir).\n\n\n\u00a0With younger trees being lumbered, many mills have relaxed grading standards.\u00a0 The folks I have talked to who buy lumber from and for lumberyards consistently tell me that what we consider #2 grade lumber today (a common construction grade) would have been classified as #3 not long ago. Furthermore, boards are not graded for twists and bows. Carpenters are expected to \"crown\" the studs in a wall so the boards all bow in the same direction and the wall appears flat. The result is that even though the wood may be suitable for construction, the overall appearance of common 2x4s sucks dead toads.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0And if the lumber's appearance is not bad enough, there are other problems you may encounter that are not so visible: \ufeff\ufeffFast-growth wood is more likely to rot. \ufeff\ufeffYoung trees have poor dimensional stability - they may even shrink lengthwise. \ufeff\ufeffThe sugar in the sapwood may attract fungi and insects If the wood is dried quickly, it's more likely to develop checks, shakes, honeycomb, and other drying-related defects \u2022 Young wood is more likely to have \"reaction wood\" that bows or warps as you cut it.\n\n\n\u00a0 But I did notice that the 2x12s that we used for the steps and stringers were of a much higher quality. Because they were wider, there were necessarily cut from bigger, older trees. They weren't perfectly clear, but there were fewer knots and defects than in the 2x4 stock, and the knots tended to be tighter. So we bought some 2x10s* and ripped our 2x4 railings from them - it worked wonderfully. *Why not 2x12s where you can get three 2x4s out of each? Because you have to use the middle board, and most of the defects, especially the pith, are closer to the middle than the edges. Furthermore, the outside boards tend toward quartersawn and riftsawn grain, which is a good deal more stable than the plainsawn middle.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0As a bonus, the 2x10s were lumbered from Southern Yellow Pine (\u201cSYP\u201d on the stamp), a much stronger wood than the white wood 2x4s. If you want the numbers, the specific gravity of Ponderosa Pine (a common SPF) is just 0.38 on the average, compared to Southern Yellow Pine at 0.59, making SYP much denser and harder. Ponderosa Pine has a bending strength (modulus of rupture) of 1.29 Mpsi and a stiffness (modulus of elasticity) of 9,400 psi; while Southern Yellow Pine stands at 1.98 Mpsi and 14,500 psi respectively.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThere is an important consideration you should be aware of, especially if you plan to use any of these woods in woodworking projects. Construction lumber is typically kiln-dried to just 19% moisture content. You will want to get that down below 10% before you can rely on the stability of the wood. At 19%, it\u2019s still shrinking! This may mean air-drying the wood for 6 months to a year before you use it. \u201c",

         "My 9 year old daughter reads for fun. My almost 7 year old son is just starting to get into reading for fun, too. When I was a kid I could read at 3 years old and read at a college level by elementary school. I read to my kids from a chapter book series we're working through, every night. We are currently reading through Little House on the Prairie series. I read it when I was a kid, too. My best friend got me the first two books for my bday when I was in 2nd/3rd grade (my daughter's age). When we're finished with all of these, I'm going to get out my Animorphs collection that I've had since childhood and read those to my kids \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06 I always encourage my children to read because in my household growing up, we had tons and tons of books because my mom is an avid reader and so am I. I read stuff on my phone, too, if I'm not reading from a book. It starts at home getting children interested in some sort of book. I went the route of graphic novels for my daughter, because she liked to read but books without at least some pictures was daunting for her in the beginning. I take them to library to get books and their school does library day once a week where they check out books to read and bring home. Not liking to read isn't an option in my household. I tell my kids there's always SOMETHING that could interest you in any of the books you see. My daughter loves animals and horses so she gravitates to those type of books.

Manga is in black-and-white and you read it backwards. And manga\u2019s popularity rose at the same time as the rise of video games and social media.

I think this has more to do with parents approach to reading (or lack thereof) and a consistent decline in funding school and public libraries. \n\nIt also seems like schools have a great difficulty teaching literature that connects with students.

I grew up loving books so much, and I genuinely believe I grew up a better person, and smarter, because I was exposed to so many sources of imagination, and learning, during my formative years.  Ninety percent of the content children absorb now is just brainrot content, and I fear it's going to get more concentrated as newer generations of parents who were exposed to that sort of content aren't going to encourage their children to read.

         "Not at all the same. TV and what you got on it was pretty much just passive entertainment. It had a singular purpose, and for the longest time, that was just fine. What we have today in just one device are MANY elements within it that are aggressively trying to hijack your brain in order to keep your eyes on them, and a great many of them are interactive, which makes them all the more exciting and extremely addictive. Sure, this affects adults too, but imagine the effects on a younger, developing brain. It's basically crack, and no book is going to stand a chance against it without some kind of external intervention.",
         "So, TV is designed to attract and maintain your attention, but through very different methods and with different abilities to track habits. The element of false socialization isn't as high with TV at all. The influencer economy is a huge part of why social media is more predatory towards kids than cable. Watching Nickelodeon and staying glued to the TV all day is not good for kids. But we don't have studies showing that it is causing as much lasting harm as the various apps and instant on demand gratification that a phone inflicts on people. The ability for your device to be with you everywhere is also a large component. Barely anything on the Internet is regulated, so the programming these kids get is on another level from what got on TV in terms of manipulation. And we all know that what got on TV wasn't very good in the first place. The ability to have interaction, even in small ways, is a game changer for getting people hooked.",

There\u2019s certainly a lot more emphasis being put on trying to make things addictive these days than there used to be.

         "The US Civil War was 160 years ago. Were the remains there all this time? How were they identified?",
         "I used to work at a cemetery. They had a common crypt or tomb for the remains of people who have never been claimed dating as far back as almost 100 years. It\u2019s legit, they were laid to rest with dignity and the tomb itself is at the heart of a memorial for the very people who left this world alone. It\u2019s sad, but it\u2019s not uncommon for families to discover long lost relatives have been entombed there. I even assisted a family in reclaiming the remains of a relative who passed over 20 years ago. They were cremated, but nobody claimed the decedents remains. After one year, their urn was placed in the crypt where it sat for 2 decades before relatives came to retrieve them and give them a proper burial. The paperwork was lengthy as chain of custody can get more cloudy as time passes.",
         "Extrapolating some things from the article\u2026\n\n - The remains had been located in a Seattle funeral home \u201cfor several decades.\u201d\n \n - The man specifically mentioned in this article, Byron Johnson, died in 1913 in Seattle. \n\n - No family was able to be located for any of the remains. \n\nMy guess is that these were all veterans who made their way out west after the Civil War, had no descendants, and had no one to claim their remains. The funeral home may not have even known they were veterans of the Civil War - they just cremated the bodies and kept the cremains in storage. If the funeral home that handled the cremations had been acquired by another funeral home, which happens often, any knowledge of those cremains could have been lost in the process or just due to sheer time. \n\nNothing malicious, just sheer circumstance. \n\nAnyway, they have now been identified and can finally have their remains placed permanently instead of just sitting on a shelf.",

         "None of that will ever happen, unfortunately.\n\nNew Orleans East, which is where the park was located, has been suffering blight since the 1980s.  The city experienced a boom as a result of increased oil drilling activity in the area but since then, oil companies have been importing more oil since it's cheaper, and the whole area and population has been in decline.\n\nAt one point, the world's largest shopping mall was located in the area.  That shut down prior to Katrina.  The whole east New Orleans region is in decay.  It makes no sense to do any development out there that isn't industrial, and even then, it remains to be seen if the location is practical.  Plus Louisiana has a long history of enticing corporations to come to the state, then screwing them over.  Most recently they keep doing this with the film industry: one minute there's tax breaks, the next there isn't.   This often is the result of the alternation of republican and democratic governors.  When the republicans are in, they unleash fossil fuel industry restrictions and screw everybody else, including any deals previous administrations made with industries they deem \"un-friendly\" to the right.\n\nRight now, Louisiana has a governor that's more concerned with forcing schools to display the 10 commandments and taking children's scholarships away if they don't kneel for the national anthem, than they are in fostering a healthy business environment.\n\nThe reason the park failed is precisely because they decided to build an amusement park in an area that was in decline - they ignored all the market research.   And then they proceeded to design a park in the swamps that had virtually no shade.  It was dumb from the start.  The only brilliant move made was getting Six Flags to buy it.",

If the park was profitable, they likely would have reopened it.  But it wasn't.  And Six Flags was having financial problems.

They were losing tons of money so it was a great excuse to never re-open.\n\nJazzland opened in 2000.   Went bankrupt in 2002.  Six Flags took over the park in 2002 and reopened it.  Katrina hit in 2005.",
         "That's not right, Six Flags leased it in 2002 and launched in 2003.\n\nThe park didn't reopen after Katrina, written off as a loss in 2006 then the lease ended in 2009 when the company went bankrupt.",

         "Six Flags only managed the park. It's owned by local investors or local government, I can't remember which.",
         "This is why I oppose corporations not being tied to specific people. I believe that the 1% highest compensated individuals should be directly responsible for all of their doings. So if Facebook goes into bankruptcy, Zuckerberg would be directly financially responsible for all of their debts and clean up of their facilities. If a corporation does something that an individual would be personally held liable for then the top 1% individuals go to prison. \n\nThe reason I say top 1% is because if we tied it to specific titles then I think they would just put random people into those titles",
         "I once hiked through a field full of rusty, non-working wind turbines in Hawaii. They just left them there to rot.",
         "Even to this day, there's been groups rallying to reuse, rebuild and re-open the park.\n\nI've toured it over the years and the idea that even half the structures could still be used is laughable, but there were a constant parade of groups lobbying the city to let them try to engage in development -- this is why the park wasn't demolished earlier.  There was always routine talk of somebody re-opening it.\n\nThe problem was, all the proposals to do so were devoid of any substance.  Lots of press releases and plans, but no committment of the kind of money needed to really follow through.  (One of my favorites was local businessman Frank Scurlock's \"dream\" of building a huge Noah's Ark there - visible from the Interstate) and creating a Christian-themed family fun park.   Basically everybody jockey'd to get the properly from the city under the plan it would be re-opened and re-used, but what they really wanted was a sweet sale/lease for a large swath of land they could do something else with later.  The city wasn't stupid though, and wasn't about to give anybody that kind of deal.  At least give them credit for that, that it didn't turn into a giant landfill.",
         "Like, beyond just the damage to the park itself, the economic devastation of the surrounding area meant that a lot fewer people would've had disposable income to spend on the park too. \n\nIt's not just people losing their homes that causes that too. Businesses get destroyed, and even if they can recover, a lot of them probably moved away (Happened with the place I work after a huge flood in 2018).",
         "The 2000\u2019s were not exactly Six Flags\u2019 prime years, I would imagine a park only open for 5 of those would not have good numbers.",
         "> You know, Katrina. The hurricane that destroyed it?\n\nand the surrounding areas.",
         "In the post Katrina life it says lots of rides were salvaged and rehomed. \n\nIf the park was highly profitable in those formative years, investors would be more inclined to reinvent. \n\nAlso, on the perhaps the park could have been built more robust to withstand hurricane damage.",
         ">The park was not profitable, as Alfa SmartParks specialized in running water parks and smaller amusement arcade centers. It attracted 1.1 million visitors for its first season, but that decreased to 560 to 580 thousand the next season; Alfa filed for bankruptcy reorganization in February 2002.[20] Citing its benefit to the local economy, HUD loaned $25.3 million to build the park, and after Alfa went bankrupt, the city of New Orleans became liable for the remainder of the loan.[21] In 2001, the lease was put up for sale, and in March 2002 Six Flags purchased it for $22M,[21] although the park\u2019s name did not change that year. The New Orleans city council approved the 75-year lease in August 2002; under the negotiated agreement, repayment of the remaining $24.4 million loan from HUD was to be split between the park ($1.4M/year) and the city ($1M/yr).  \n\nReference [Six Flags New Orleans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Flags_New_Orleans)",
         "I'm pretty sure the film noted the financial issues the park faced before the storm.",
         "Closed in 5 years? Sounds like the owners didn't research the market.",
         "It's a peninsula.",
         "They took the ground out of the environment and replaced it all with concrete bunkers and buildings on top.",
         "Agreed, you want corporation to have \"speech\" then it needs to have a body to throw in jail. No more fines for illegal dumping and such, right to prison with the people who hold controlling interest.",
         "Thanks for informing me, I am from Louisiana, lived in Baton Rouge for over 20 years and i never knew all that.",
         "Uninsured persons who are exhausted and have lost everything are not looking to go to an amusement park. A lot of cars were destroyed. A lot of people left LA for good.\n\nKatrina was devastating. It\u2019s hard to want to go ride roller coasters when you\u2019re battling the loss of friends, family, your home, depression, PTSD, and\u2026 well, everything. It\u2019s especially hard when so many cars were totaled. It took a huge effort to even clear the roads. To get regular food and access to clean water.\n\nThe government did New Orleans so dirty.",
         "I\u2019m from Nola. It took 5-10 years to rebuild the city after Katrina, and the population still hasn\u2019t recovered completely. Not to mention, the park was in one of the worst damaged areas, and the Great Recession hit the country right after Katrina.",
         "If you look at some of the pictures after the hurricane you can see the whole park submerged in several feet of water. There's no such thing as a roller coaster built robustly enough to withstand that at the foundational level to then be trustworthy enough for passengers to safely ride. No insurance company would take that bet.",
         "You see, there was this hurricane. Made all the rides rusty and all the hotdog buns soggy.",
         "More of an illusion really.",

If you are an airline with a big 737 fleet, you'll buy the MAX, if you have lots of A320s, you'll buy the A320. The reason the A320 broke into the market was the gap left by the end of production of the MD-80 family, the Fokkers, and the 727. Lots of airlines had a gap and chose the A320 as the 737 was a bit behind before the 737NG was flying.\n\nThe A330 and 787 compete directly. If you have old 767s, you are going to choose one of those, whichever makes the most sense for your route network.\n\nThe A350 kinda competes with the 777, but also doesn't at the same time. The 777 is bigger by a significant margin, and whenever the X actually finishes certification, will be more efficient. But the A350 has RANGE going for it, incredible range.\n\nAirbus has the Bombardier C Series (A220) in a segment that Boeing does not compete in. Likewise, Boeing offers a super heavy freighter in the 777F, and even when the A350F comes out, it will still have a smaller payload capacity.\n\nOffering wise, both companies have very competitive lineups.

Similar to mental health institutions built in the West after World War 1, a lot of them have facilities for \"controversial\" therapy techniques like electro-shock therapy. \n\nSome of the better ones were built by charities. Some of the best medical facilities in Iran are doner/charity funded. It's not easy to get into those, and I doubt the government sends detainees to those places. \n\nAnd Of course, Iran has private mental health hospitals, which are mostly meant for drug rehabilitation. They tend to lean toward the expensive side. \n\nIranian government has a habit of sending people to mental institutions as a way of discrediting them. Especially political prisoners. Something as simple as a tattoo can be considered a sign of mental illness as far as the government is concerned. \n\nPrisoners who are sent to mental institutions don't usually stay there for long.

         "So this went exactly as expected. No court wants to be the one to make the decision. And in the end Elon Musk gets to pay people to vote, even though that's supposed to be illegal. There is nothing you cannot do or get away with in the United States if you're rich enough.",

Vetting voters to make sure they \"align with the group\" is a fucking crime, punishable by up to 2 years in federal prison (plus state-level crimes). It is awarding money to voters only if they agree to support the values of the PAC. It's pretty blatant.\n\n3.

To be clear, Musk is still in trouble here, but he got one small win in that the injunction request has been denied. The injunction request was essentially denied because it would be a legal proceeding that is unnecessary since this whole \"not a lottery\" scheme is over tomorrow and that they have admitted that the scheme is not a lottery, that no one had a real chance of winning anything unless they were picked.  \n   \nThis is not the end of the legal troubles in this case, it literally only says, \"Fine, give the last 1 million out, we don't want to be bothered in stopping it, instead we are going to punish you in a later hearing for breaking the law.\"  \n   \nWhile I would argue the injunction still should have went through and that it is a \"public relations\" win for Elon, it is not a legal win at all. He still has the legal shit storm of paying people to vote/register, and he still has to deal with any new legal issues that his admission in court will now cause.  \n   \nHe got a short term win here 100%. If Donald Trump gets elected, he gets a long term win as well - but even that is a murky win since technically this is a state case and Trump can't pardon it. If Harris wins, Elon has screwed himself over in so many ways that long term this is pretty bad for him.",

         "True. But if you get paid monthly and have to pay a months worth of meals anyway, it makes sense to put it all on in one go doesnt it?",
         "Yes, I get what you mean. Not everyone can do that, or even put 100 on at a time. It\u2019s shit that they\u2019ve put limits on, Nevermind the transaction fees everytime. For all the families that can only put enough on per week it\u2019s like paying for an extra meal, it\u2019s not fair for people that are struggling. I bet with the COL crisis it\u2019s not just low income families struggling either.",

My wife and I never did because she had cancerous tumors in her uterus.\u00a0\n\nWhile I agree that school lunches should be free, I think this ban doesn\u2019t hit the right party.

If they had insufficient evidence to convict the individual then the proper course is to drop the case. It isn't to try to get some level of 'justice' anyways. That isn't justice. That is why I take issue as I said with this kind of deal. If they felt strongly about their case then a deal like this is insufficient. If they felt their case was weak enough that this deal was appropriate then they should be dropping the case instead. It is insufficient in either way.",

I understand it was Sheila's hair, the whole point is that her hair was in a place it reasonably should be and there seemingly was not anything that tied the vehicle to the murder. In fact it seems to be the opposite that there is testimony that excludes the vehicle from being the one used by the murderer. If there was additional evidence that linked the car to the murder then that would certainly help, though it doesn't really change the fact that it is not unusual for her hair to be in the car.",
         "I replied to the wrong person, don\u2019t mind me.",
         "Clown wig hairs were also found in the vehicle. The vehicle was seen at the murder scene. The murderer got into it and drove away. The vehicle belonged to a car sales lot which was the competitor of the husband, and because of something the husband did the cars of the other lot would be returned to his. Sheila had no good reason for her hair to be in the car. \n\nI don't need to re-read this specific article. This case is local to me. I don't base my knowledge of it on one article.",
         "Its all good, it did kind of seem like we largely saw things the same way.",
         "The car was not seen at the crime scene. A different car was there. It was the hair and the wig fibers together that pinned it.",
         "Fibre analysis tends to be junk science first of all. Who saw it at the murder scene? The article claims that the son and another witness deny the car was the one they saw. Who was it who claimed that the car matched?\n\nThe car belonged to a different car lot who she repossessed cars for. So yes, there likely was good reason for her hair to be in the car if she worked with and collected cars for that car lot. \n\nYou do need to reread the article because if you are claiming to have knowledge which is not contained in it you need to understand what claims you are trying to address so you can address them properly. Your argument boils down to \"trust me\" which is not how you argue your position.",
         ">The car belonged to a different car lot who she repossessed cars for.\n\n>>The white Chrysler convertible had been reported stolen from Michael Warren\u2019s car lot a month before the shooting.\n\nOh hey look, you're fucking wrong, but please keep telling others to read about the case.",
         "She's a convicted murderer and it's a travesty that she's not in prison for life. You clearly don't know enough and for some reason you think that one article says everything there is to the case, which is laughable. Whatever your reason to simp for Sheila is, good luck.",
         "Its the very next line.\n\n>The white Chrysler convertible had been reported stolen from Michael Warren\u2019s car lot a month before the shooting. Keen-Warren and her then-husband repossessed cars for him.\n\nIt being stolen doesn't change who it belonged to.",
         "I don't think one article says everything about the case. The fact you can't explain your position is not the articles fault. It is your fault. She would not be a convicted murderer if she had been offered life in prison. She may have been found guilty, she may have been found not guilty. That is where your logic falls apart. \n\nIf you have so much knowledge it should be very easy to go into details but for some reason you seem incredibly unwilling to do so. I am not the one who seems to be showing a rather strong bias, you are.",
         "Being convicted doesn\u2019t actually make you guilty. \n\nNot-so-fun fact for you.\n\nLots of innocent people released on false convictions.\n\nDon\u2019t even look up how common planting evidence is in the USA."

Or, god forbid, all four!\n\nSo, you knew from the start that it would all be a lie, and he was just going to be giving money to his friends.\n\nThe fact that his lawyers are coming out and straight-up admitting to massive fraud - tells you how scared they are of the illegal-lottery charges.",
         "The reason they are saying it wasn't a lottery has to do with the requirements around sweepstakes versus a contest. Essentially the one they want to avoid is a sweepstakes/lottery, where there is random selection. Where random selection occurs there is more rigorous requirements from laws, such as alternative methods of entry. A contest on the other hand can have other rules, including the organization selecting the winners with intention. The difference between the two is nuanced, but essentially they are trying to argue this was a contest not a sweepstakes or lottery. Contests allow for it to be a qualified marketing expense to giveaway money, so long as there is not an equal chance of winning for every entrant. [https://nationalsweepstakescompany.com/blog/sweepstakes-vs-contest/](https://nationalsweepstakescompany.com/blog/sweepstakes-vs-contest/)\n\n  \nThe thing I don't think they did though was layout the requirements of how winners would be selected in advance. So they may still run afoul of the rules around contests. The thing is here though there are two sets of laws, one is around election interference, and then around sweepstakes/contests. I would argue that they have violated both, but election laws may carry more than civil penalties and fines. I would imagine the lawyer wants to keep this as close to a marketing campaign for Trump, and them just not following all of the rules they should have and end up paying a fine. The reality I hope for is there are some actual criminal charges, but we will have to wait and see.",

At least one device was located and neutralized in Birmingham, UK, and another in Leipzig, Germany. These specific instances are believed to have been practice / test runs for later, larger scale sabotage. This occured in July, but underscores the effort Russia is actively putting forth to sabotage the US and NATO allies, to include harming civilian commercial transportation.  \n\nEDIT: Thank you for the correction, GRU is not KGB successor but a contemporary. More analogous to the American DIA vs KGB~CIA. Either way, nefarious and Soviet-era linked nature still stands",

         "[Here's a much better article](https://abcnews.go.com/US/adam-coy-verdict-ohio-shooting-andre-hill/story?id=115326088). It doesn't add the courtroom bullshit or that the cop is being treated for treated for Hodgkin lymphoma, both trying to make you feel bad for the cop.\n\nI'll just copy the text.\n\n\n>Former police officer Adam Coy was found guilty of murder on Monday by a jury in the 2020 fatal shooting of Andre Hill, a 47-year-old unarmed Black man who was shot four times after the defendant ordered him to emerge from a darkened garage while holding a cellphone and a large set of keys.\n\n\n>The jury in the high-profile Franklin County Court of Common Pleas case announced its verdict after deliberating for about two-and-a-half days.\n\n\n>Besides murder, the jury also found Coy guilty of felonious assault and reckless homicide.\n\n\n>\"This verdict delivers a measure of justice for Andre Hill's family, who have waited nearly four years to see criminal accountability for his tragic and unnecessary death,\" national civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump, who represents Hill's family, said in a statement. \"Andre was an unarmed, innocent man, and his life was taken with disregard for the duty to protect and serve. Today\u2019s verdict underscores that no one is above the law, including those sworn to uphold it.\"\n\n\n>Crump added, \"We hope these verdicts bring some healing to the Hill family and send a powerful message: accountability in law enforcement is not optional.\"\n\n\n>Coy asserted during the trial that he feared for his life when he mistakenly believed Hill was leveling a silver revolver at him as he stepped out of the garage on Dec. 22, 2020. But the silver revolver Coy testified that he believed Hill was holding in his right hand turned out to be a set of silver keys.\n\n\n>\"I thought I was going to die,\" an emotional Coy, a former member of the Columbus Division of Police, testified last week.\n\n\n>Coy faces a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole. He is scheduled to be sentenced on Nov. 25.\n\n\n>After the verdict was announced just after noon local time, Judge Stephen L. McIntosh revoked Coy's $1 million bond and Coy was immediately taken into custody by court officers who led him out of the courtroom.\n\n>Coy was fired from the Columbus Police Department about a week after the shooting.\n\n>About a month after the shooting, Coy was arrested and indicted in the killing of Hill.\n\n>Coy did not turn on his body-worn camera until he shot Hill, but the device has a \"look-back\" function that automatically activated and recorded 60 seconds of the episode without sound, including capturing the shooting.\n\n\n>The body camera footage, which was played for the jury, also showed that as Hill lay dying on the floor of the garage, none of the officers who responded to the incident appeared to immediately provide first aid. The footage showed a woman coming out of the house and telling officers that Hill was a guest and that \"he was bringing me Christmas money. He didn't do anything.\"\n\n>The jury reached its decision after hearing closing arguments on Wednesday.\n\n>During his summation, Franklin County prosecutor Anthony Pierson told the jury that the evidence proved beyond reasonable doubt that Coy's use of deadly force was not justified, according to his training and national police standards.\n\n>\"This case isn't about someone who is resisting arrest, where officers pile on him, put a knee on him or something like that and he died,\" Pierson said. \"This case is not about someone who tells cops, 'I hate you. I'm going to shoot you,' It's not about that. It's about a man who was following police orders and was killed for it.\"\nMORE: Jurors in murder trial of former Ohio police officer offered contrasting theories in killing of Andre Hill\n\n>Coy's attorney, Mark Collins, slammed the state's case, saying prosecutors did not prove the charges beyond reasonable doubt.\n\n>\"We now know that the government's theory that somehow he [Coy] shot an unarmed man and made the entire thing up after the fact,\" Collins told the jurors, referring to Coy's claims of self-defense after wrongly believing he saw a gun in Hill's hand. \"But that's perverse ladies and gentlemen. That's desperate ladies and gentlemen. That's the government ladies and gentlemen.\"\n\n\n>Collins added, \"I'm surprised they didn't say that he planted the keys.\"\n\n>In May 2021, the City of Columbus agreed to a $10 million wrongful death settlement with Hill's family, the highest amount ever paid by the city.\n\n>The indictment of Coy in February 2021 came just days after the Columbus City Council also passed Andre's Law, which was named after Hill and requires Columbus police officers to turn on their body cameras when responding to calls and to immediately render first aid after a use-of-force incident.\n\n\nI think we know who the defense attorney is voting for.\n\n>Coy's attorney, Mark Collins, slammed the state's case, saying prosecutors did not prove the charges beyond reasonable doubt.\n\n>\"We now know that **the government**'s theory that somehow he [Coy] shot an unarmed man and made the entire thing up after the fact,\" Collins told the jurors, referring to Coy's claims of self-defense after wrongly believing he saw a gun in Hill's hand. \"But **that's perverse** ladies and gentlemen. **That's desperate** ladies and gentlemen. **That's the government ladies and gentlemen.\"**\n\nYeah, I do think he made up the I feared for my life story after the fact, he didn't even think his body cam caught the shooting because he didn't turn it on until after he shot him. But he didn't know the bodycam has a \"look-back\" function that automatically activates and recordes the 60 seconds before it's turned on, just without sound. \nThat video captured the shooting and what's probably got him convicted. \n\nAlso the feared for my life, they get 24 hours to meet with union reps and superiors before they have to give an official statement, where they have their union lawyer and union representative also sitting in. For context you get arrested and formally charged you must give your statement immediately.\n\nThat's why the few cops in the videos that cry and say things like I didn't know, or I'm sorry, or show a normal human response for killing an innocent person. Suddenly on their official statement they feared for their life or the life an safety of a colleague/civilian/rich white guys money. We could've lost all of them unless I shot and shot and shot and shot until my magazine was empty\n\n\n>**Collins added, \"I'm surprised they didn't say that he planted the keys.\"**\n\nWow, that's an experienced attorney everyone.",

         "More than a dozen of Lewisville Police Department\u2019s officers faced disciplinary action after an investigation found that they acted inappropriately while trying to catch prostitution suspects at local massage parlors.\n\nIn a statement, Lewisville Police Chief Brook Rollins said the misconduct happened between October of 2022 and June of 2024.\n\nThat\u2019s when the department\u2019s undercover officers began an operation targeting alleged prostitution at massage establishments in the city.\n\nThe operation yielded 23 cases in two years with 32 criminal charges against 28 suspects at 10 businesses. However, the Denton County District Attorney rejected all of those cases.\n\n\"The DA\u2019s office stated they were not able to prosecute these cases because the undercover officers had been engaging in inappropriate physical contact with the suspected prostitutes. I obtained the list of declined cases from the DA, and we immediately began an administrative review,\" Chief Rollins said.\n\nAn internal review found 13 Lewisville police officers violated the city and department's policy prohibiting physical contact once probable cause for a prostitution arrest has been established.\n\nIn other words, once the undercover officers agreed to pay for the sexual contact, probable cause was legally established, and no touching needed to occur.\n\nIn the end, three officers were fired, one was demoted, and seven were suspended without pay. Two were also given counseling, and several were reassigned from their undercover roles.\n\nThe department also had to return two seized vehicles and $247,807 in seized cash.\n\n\"To the residents of Lewisville, this entire incident is embarrassing and disappointing. As the Chief of Police for the Lewisville Police Department, it is my job to ensure the department operates with the utmost professionalism, integrity, and honor. I am sorry that we fell short of that,\" Rollins said.\n\nThe results of the department\u2019s internal review were turned over to the Texas Department of Public Safety and the Texas Rangers for a criminal investigation.",
         "This same thing occurred in another jurisdiction many years ago. I can't remember where it was though.  Cops actually went through with receiving sexual services.\n\nAlso, I spent  2 1/2 years as a police reservist.  In my experience, cops can't keep their pants zipped up.  They screw police groupies, many screwed the same one.  One had a wife about to drop a baby in a month and was cheating on her.   I looked up to one of the officers who seemed to have his stuff together and seemed like a solid person.  Turned out he was screwing the dispatcher while his wife was undergoing treatment for blood cancer. \n\nAnother story is one screwed known local prostitute.  Other guys on the force found out about it, got stationary from the hospital and mailed the letter to him that the proustite had aids, named him as a John and that he should get checked.   They let him believe that for over a week before telling him.",

A lot of stuff is already priced ridiculously high according to what you can barely afford... what happens when a woman who's uneducated with maybe not even a high school diploma, has to turn to prostitution to pay the bills? And what happens when said prostitution industry becomes mainstream enough where a few big companies run the entire industry and lobby out anyone else? \n\nIt'll likely turn into the amateur acting, modeling, and music industry with extremely predatory and confining contracts. Once your sex life becomes a valid and marketable commodity, suddenly you can begin enforcing forced sex contracts, virginity contracts, chastity contracts... Look, I love chastity as a kink - it can be fun when both parties are consensually involved. But I genuinely fear that parents will start enforcing their childrens' virginity once it becomes lucrative, parents grooming their children to become popular stars... but instead of of stars, it's just being a contracted five-star prostitute.\n\nHonestly I'm fine with the status quo but that's just my potentially biased perspective - not ridiculously heinous as long as you're not bragging everywhere, but also not mainstream enough where everyone wants a piece of the pie. It's already not bad since women have a reasonable amount of freedom to run OnlyFans / other sex work on their own (other than credit card companies trying to ruin the fun) even though there's still some shaming.

You are calling him a regional premier, but he is literally the [President of the Valencian government](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_Valencian_Government).\n\n\nThe regional authorities literally do not have the authority to issue alerts to the public, that is the responsibility of each region, and the regions send alerts to their citizens. For comparison, saying 'the Spanish government' should have sent the alerts is like saying the EU should have made a broadcast on French TV, or that the United Nations should stop false election posts in the USA.\u00a0\n\n\nThere are decisions that bodies can make and pass down, urging the relevant authorities to act, but if they don't have the legal authority (or means) to somehow leapfrog the authorities below them, it's absurd to say they're responsible.\n\n\n\n\nIt's also worth noting that Valencia is one of the regions in Spain that does not have a hugely active independence movement, and seems reasonably content to be part of Spain (whereas a majority of Spain has independence referendums every few years which are ignored). The local government is of a very, very different ideology from the main government, decided last year to disband the regional emergency response teams, and the president spent the day before the flood receiving alerts and making public statements like 'The worst of the storm seems to have passed' and 'we are in no danger'.\n\n\n\n\nSo it's incredibly disengenuous to say it has anything to do with the local government and to brush off the regional governments responsibility, especially in this rare case when the people have voted for the existing powers of local and national government responsibilities.\n\n\nNow that's got nothing to do with the royal family, but it's not the first time a right-wing nationalist party has screwed up and the people who voted for them have blamed a random figurehead.",

He can\u2019t sell the Crown Estate for profit nor does he have direct access to the revenue. The government uses some of the revenue to fund official royal duties but they pocket most of it.

We have alert systems for a reason. Every country does. Who delayed in issuing those orders?\n\nIt's not a figurehead. The figurehead can't fire anyone. The figurehead can't order an independent review. The figurehead can't send more government search and rescue workers.\n\nThat isn't a defense of outdated monarchies. It's the reality of failures of governmental agencies that need to answer to their people.",

He composed, arranged, and produced for fucking *everyone* and was a big part of keeping jazz alive through the 50s and 60s when rock and roll was much more popular.

         "My Quincy Jones story - in 1986 I was 14 and I visited my older brother who was living/working in downtown LA (we were from the rural mid-west).  Since I was a basic bitch I was a huge Lakers fan at the time (Kareem, Magic, etc) and my brother took me to a game at the Forum.  About half-way through the second quarter during a time-out, my brother said, \"Come on, we're upgrading\".  We walked down to the floor, directly behind the Lakers' bench (3 ft from KAJ!), passing right in front of Jack Nicholson!, and grabbed a couple of seats in the 2nd or 3rd row mid-court behind the Lakers' bench.  When I asked whose seats these were, the only thing my brother said was, \"Be cool.\"  So I enjoyed the game.  At half-time, the lady seated next to me starting talking to me.  She eventually asked, \"So how do you guys know Quincy?\"  I just mumbled something about my brother working for IBM (which he did) and she moved on.  Even little old rural me knew that there was only one Quincy who had season tix to seats like these.  I spent the rest of the game enjoying myself but more than a little scared that the night would end with Quincy Jones hollering at me.  But he never showed and at the end of the game the lady next to me said, \"Say hi to Quincy!\"\n\nThanks Quincy for all the music etc and the great seats for 2/3 of a Lakers game in 1986!",

She taught and worked with so many twentieths century composers it\u2019s incredible. (Stravinsky, Copeland, Glass, etc) She was tough as nails and quite literally whipped you into musical shape.

In no way does that justify actually endangering children, not only for moral reasons (which is certainly the primary concern), but also because it adds nothing of comedic value to the joke. It's not fun for the kids to interact with this bowl, and it's not fun for the parents to imagine their children actually being harmed by some reckless assholes who thinks their political satire is too on point to hide from the world.\u00a0",

         "Article Text:\n\nBEIJING (AP) \u2014 Three Chinese astronauts returned to Earth on Monday after a six-month stay on the Tiangong space station, part of China\u2019s effort to be a global leader in space exploration.\n\nA parachute slowed their capsule\u2019s nighttime descent to a remote landing area in China\u2019s Inner Mongolia region. The crew emerged after touching down at 1:24 a.m. A Chinese national flag stuck in the ground near the capsule flapped in the wind.\n\nIn recent years, the country\u2019s space program has brought back rocks from the moon and landed a rover on Mars. It aims to put a person on the moon by 2030, which would make China the second nation after the United States to do so.\n\nThe space station astronauts returned after welcoming a replacement three-person crew last week for the latest six-month mission. The new team of one woman and two men will conduct experiments, carry out spacewalks and install equipment to protect the station from space debris.\n\nA space agency official said in April that Tiangong had maneuvered several times to avoid debris and had partially lost power when the solar wing\u2019s power cables were hit by debris, according to a report from the official Xinhua News Agency.\n\nChina is among the countries that have created space debris, including the reported break-up of a rocket stage in August during the launch of the first 18 satellites for a global internet service similar to Starlink, the still-growing constellation of satellites operated by Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX.\n\nTiangong, which means Heavenly Palace, was completed two years ago and orbits the earth.\n\nOnly Chinese astronauts have gone to the space station so far, but a space agency spokesperson said last week that China is in discussions to select and train astronauts from other nations to join the missions, Xinhua reported.\n\nAstronauts from several nations have traveled to the International Space Station, but China is blocked from that program mainly because of U.S. concerns over the military\u2019s involvement in China\u2019s space program.\n\nChina laid out an ambitious plan last month to become a leader in space science research by 2050 in conjunction with its advances in space exploration.",

It merely allows Iowa to require some voters to submit a provisional ballot which will be counted when the propriety of their voting is established.  Yes it's an inconvenience, but it's not a deprivation of rights.\n\nThe political reason I like it is that it is going to blow up in Republicans' faces when they find NO NONCITIZENS TRYING TO VOTE.  They've made their hunt public and now they'll have to tell us what they find.  It's the best proof there is that there is no issue with noncitizens voting.\n\nThe philosphical reason I like it is that it is a decision in favor of the Republicans' position by a judge appointed by Joe Biden.

US was on a roll. We could move on from the war issues and the sub-prime mortgage collapse. We were riding high. The internet was still pushing new boundaries and was full of excitement.\n\n2016 to now feels like an eternity where everything has reversed course and so much of that progress I've observed my entire adult life has been wiped away.

The category also includes certain stimulants, sedatives and opioids.\n> \n> It\u2019s the first time a state has classified abortion pills as controlled substances.\u00a0\n> \n> The new lawsuit, filed Thursday, alleges that the law could create barriers for health care workers who need to administer mifepristone and misoprostol quickly in an emergency, thereby delaying patients\u2019 access to the pills and creating a risk of harm. The complaint also says the law discriminates against people who need the medications, since patients with similarly severe medical needs aren\u2019t subject to the same delays if they need other drugs. It seeks to prevent the law from being enforced.\n> \n> According to the American College of Medical Toxicology, mifepristone and misoprostol do not meet the definition of a controlled substance.

         "MAUMERE, Indonesia (AP) \u2014 Indonesia\u2019s National Disaster Management Agency said Monday that at least 10 people have died as a series of volcanic eruptions widens on the remote island of Flores.\n\nThe eruption at Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki around midnight spewed thick brownish ash as high as 2,000 meters (6,500 feet) into the air and hot ashes hit several villages, burning down houses including a convent of Catholic nuns, said Firman Yosef, an official at the Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki monitoring post",

         "I think there might be a mistranslation there. The eruption was big, but not that big. Like maybe very low end VEI3 Vulcanian eruption from what I understand for this specific paroxysm. Unless these houses were in a river valley and hit by a lahar due to rain after the eruption, it does not appear that that much material was actually released.\n\nFor reference, the eruption of the Ruang volcano earlier this year, also in Indonesia, emitted 3 separate pulses, one of those was VEI3, and the other 2 were Plinian VEI4, the entire eruptive sequence was a VEI5 eruption. This was a much, much larger eruption, producing much more volcanic debris. The eruption plume from both large VEI4 pulses was over 25 kilometers. Yet, it resulted in only a few inches of accumulated ash 4KM away on the neighboring Tahulandang.\n\nPutting this in scale, the Lewotobi eruption ejected between 10 and 100x less tephra compared to Ruang. Considering the stated plume height of only 2 kilometers, I would put it on the smaller side of that so closer to 100x smaller than Ruang's eruption.\n\nThis being a mistranslation also matches up with the pictures I have seen of the aftermath of this eruption.\n\nhttps://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2182153098.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill/f_webp\n\nhttps://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2182149018.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill/f_webp\n\nhttps://static.dw.com/image/70679718_1006.jpg\n\nhttps://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/8597/live/f203b220-9a7e-11ef-8db6-ef78bfd874ce.jpg.webp",

The four kids had to share one room in a rental home (the other two bedrooms were for him and his wife, and his 'office').  They had one old car.  They lived in that place from 1964 until this year, always renting.  His wife (whom he impregnated at age 18), went to work and had a good 401K.  He took over the 'investment' and when he died they discovered that the money was gone.  You can't make this stuff up. Ironically, wife decided to stay with him after the abuse came out when my half-sister was in her late 30's.  If she had decided to dump him, she might have a more comfortable retirement today.\n\nSo yeah - 'family' is the people who love you, blood or no.  And sometimes life protects us in unusual ways.",

A study published in January 2024 estimated that, during the 16 months following Texas' implementation of a total abortion ban in June 2022, there were approximately 26,313 pregnancies resulting from rape in the state. \n\nIt's important to note that this figure represents the estimated number of pregnancies resulting from rape, not the number of births. The study did not specify how many of these pregnancies were carried to term, terminated through legal or illegal means, or ended in miscarriage. Therefore, while the number of rape-related pregnancies is significant, the exact number of births resulting from these pregnancies remains undetermined.",

It states that less than 10% of the US lives in Texas (men included, please note that), and 1 in 7 of the entire country's maternal deaths happen in Texas\u2013 that's over 14%. That's insane! \n\nI had a full post typed up that delved into some of the reasons for this, largely pertaining to miscarriage treatment, but it ended up not posting so here is the less detailed version... 10-20% of pregnancies end in miscarriage\u2013 that number is hard to narrow down on because many miscarriages happen before women know they're pregnant, so it may even be higher. Regardless, that's a crazy amount of women potentially impacted, potentially denied treatment for their miscarriage due to the law or fear for legal repercussion. Miscarriage can quickly lead to infection if not properly treated, and treatment often relies on the same procedures used for abortion. You can see how a doctor's hands could be tied up. And miscarriage isn't even the only reason for maternal mortality. Pregnancy is dangerous. Abortion can 100% be necessary to save a woman's life. Don't be selfish when you go to vote on Tuesday; abortion ban can and will affect someone in your life if it hasn't already.",

Pets are considered property so it\u2019s difficult to get more than that. At best, the girl could hope to win a thousand bucks even if this went to a jury (couple hundred for a goat, couple hundred extra for punitive). Jail is not on the radar for this since they had a warrant.\n\nAs part of discovery, Shasta County has to turn over relevant information about the case to opposing counsel. They want to keep Cedar\u2019s fate a secret. In other words, Shasta County is rejecting the authority of the court of law. **The penalties for killing a goat are one thing, the penalty for telling a judge to F themselves is another.**\n\nThe prosecution isn\u2019t stupid. They know the same thing. They know that the defense is going to jail unless the case is dropped, and defense doesn\u2019t want jail. Not only that, putting the defense in jail is cheap. They don\u2019t even need to go to trial.\n\nShasta County basically has only one way out of this mess. Money. Lots and lots of money. More money than a jury could possibly force them to pay. Enough money to buy hundreds or thousands of goats.",

         "A 9-year-old girl who fell in love with the goat she raised for the Shasta District Fair was heartbroken when deputies, wielding a search warrant, confiscated the furry livestock, taking him away to be butchered.\n\nTwo years after the scandal erupted, Shasta County has agreed to pay $300,000 to the girl\u2019s family to settle the legal dispute over the floppy-eared brown-and-white goat named Cedar.\n\nThe young girl had raised the goat for the 2022 fair, as part of a program intended to teach youngsters how to care for farm animals. But when it came time to sell Cedar and turn him over to be butchered, Jessica Long\u2019s 9-year-old daughter couldn\u2019t do it.\n\nLong took the goat away from the fair, offered to pay for the costs, and pleaded with fair officials to let her daughter keep Cedar. Instead, the Shasta County Sheriff\u2019s Office deployed deputies, search warrant in hand, to drive hundreds of miles across Northern California to find and take the goat from Billy\u2019s Mini Farm, where Long had taken him until the dispute was resolved.\n\nIt is not clear who contacted and instructed the sheriff\u2019s office to get involved.\n\nThe case caused an uproar and, in a federal lawsuit, Long and her daughter alleged deputies wrongfully took out a search warrant, seized Cedar, and turned the animal over to fair officials. Attorneys also accused county and fair officials of using law enforcement to intervene in what they said was a legal civil dispute over who owned the goat.\n\nCedar, who was bought at the county fair for $902, was butchered, but it remains unclear who did it.\n\nOn Friday, U.S. District Judge Dale A. Drozd approved the settlement that requires Shasta County to pay $300,000 to Long and her daughter to settle the federal suit out of court.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, this litigation cannot bring Cedar home,\u201d said Vanessa Shakib, an attorney representing Long. \u201cBut the $300,000 settlement with the County of Shasta and Shasta County Sheriff\u2019s Office is the first step forward.\u201d\n\nThe settlement brings about a partial end to what has been two years of contentious litigation between Long and Shasta County and fair officials.\n\nDuring the last two years, Shakib said fair and county officials have engaged in \u201cobstructionist discovery tactics\u201d to avoid answering key questions about happened to the goat, and what role officials played in seizing and destroying the animal.\n\n\u201cYears later this case still has several unanswered questions,\u201d she said.\n\nAfter two years of reviewing texts, emails, phone records and depositions, Shakib said county and fair officials have yet to make clear who butchered Cedar, what happened to his meat and who got sheriff deputies involved in the dispute.\n\nText messages uncovered during the federal lawsuit suggests fair officials wanted to keep secret what happened to Cedar and who was involved.\n\n\u201cKathy said ok but no one needs to know about this,\u201d B.J.

Long and her attorney reached out before the goat was butchered and told sheriff, fair and county officials they were disputing ownership of the goat.\n\nStill, someone decided to order that Cedar be seized and killed despite knowing a lawsuit was incoming, Shakib said.\n\nCounty officials deny any wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cThe County did nothing wrong, but we recognize the risk and cost involved in going to trial, and so we agreed to settle the case,\u201d Christopher Pisano, an attorney for Shasta County, said in an email. \u201cWe are happy to be moving on and putting this case behind us.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Shasta County did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Silva, who still serves as CEO for the Shasta District Fair, also did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nDespite the partial settlement with Shasta County and the Shasta County Sheriff\u2019s Office, the lawsuit is still ongoing. Long and her daughter still have claims against Shasta District Fair employees and a 4-H volunteer.\n\nShakib said attorneys are still reviewing discovery, including phone records, to try to find out what happened to Cedar.\n\n\n\nSaved some time",

They were authorized to search one location, the goat wasn't there, but they kept checking other places not covered by the warrant. So, that certainly seems like ample grounds to fire the deputies who executed the search warrant because that's like Day 1 material at the Police Academy. Even if all you know about being a police officer is what you learned from watching Law & Order you probably know this.

My family and I are very involved in animal rescue and I've seen too many animals intentionally harmed by other people. It happens constantly, and entirely too many of those people are actually proud of themselves. They claim to be defending their 'way of life' from radical liberals that want everyone to eat soy burgers. There's a religious component too, of course. It varies from 'humans are more important than animals' to 'everything on earth is here for us to use.' I hate them all. I truly hate them. There are a few people willing to push back, but that isn't easy. It's almost impossible to interfere legally, and very few people will risk doing anything illegal. \"Very few' isn't zero though. Some of us are willing to do whatever we can when we see an opportunity.\n\n Laws to protect animal welfare can actually be a problem in some situations. We have to be very vigilant here because our state laws can be manipulated without too much trouble.  its easy to use laws that were meant to protect animals to cause harm instead.  Its not hard to seize animals (and kill them) under the pretense of protecting them from abuse or neglect. That couldn't happen if killing animals wasn't considered an acceptable solution, but it is. Just as an example, Amish puppy mills are a big problem in this state. When new laws started cracking down on breeders, many operations chose to kill their animals instead of letting rescue groups take them. The Amish were the worst, but they weren't the only ones that killed the animals out of spite rather than let them be adopted. It was all perfectly legal.",

And unlike the US, most universties here are comparable in quality when it comes to teaching and quality of graduates. Research is another story, with some far stronger than others, but *in general* a degree from one is much the the same as another.\n\nBut to answer your question, private universities *can* charge whatever they want. They don't use the HECS system, but students can still get government loans to cover some or all of the fees up to a certain amount (around $120k I believe). A typical private university degree will cost around that amount, usually about $30-40k per year, although medicine, dentistry, etc, will cost substantially more.",

Free certifications for trades, management, technical applications etc...\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nHigher education should be pursued by everyone, and society benefits in general from a educated population, which is why everyone paying taxes to fund it makes sense.\u00a0\n\n\nPlus if university is free, there will no longer be the concern of working outside of your field. If you go to school for social work and end up working a trades, it won't feel like a waste of money since it wouldn't cost anything. The worst case scenario would be that we have auch more generally educated working class.

Australians and New Zealanders have TAFEs or polytechnic schools, basically trade schools where you can study more hands on skills such as mechanics, hospitality, and administration/accounting. And there is plenty of employment for those who simply choose to direct employment after school. University is pursued because your career choice requires a bachelor's degree - for example: teaching, law, medicine, psychology, and journalism. Unlike US college where your study is more open with majors and minors and you attend post graduate for things like medicine or law - the Australian and New Zealand Universities are set up so your study is specialized in your career path from the beginning (with the exception of Bachelor or Arts or Social Sciences - which are more broad in nature but can lead to more varied career possibilties). So if you go to University to be a teacher- then every paper/subject except for the possible odd elective subject - is focused on you training to be a teacher.",

Because expanding enrollments has its own consequences, like greater competition for housing (LA isn't known for housing affordability), lowered ability to provide an education due to excessive class sizes, and straining the infrastructure in and around the campus. \n\n>rather than putting endowments on the stock market like a corporate pension\n\nAnd if private businesses can list on the market, and the expectation is that higher education won't become a public service, then it should absolutely be allowed for them to.",

If only some of them report and some do not, it has a massive negative impact on the local agencies ability to request funding.

If it's 5 murders and your population is 1,000,000 people, you'd report it as .5 murders per 1000,000 residents. If it's 5 murders and your population is 10,000, you'd report it as 50 murders per 100,000 residents. In each of these three regions, the total number of murders hasn't changed. This gives us a method to compare 'how likely is this to happen to you' between different regions. You have a much greater chance (albeit still pretty small) of being murdered in the third example (the 10,000 residence one) than you do in the second example (the 1,000,000 residence one).\n\nUsually, when a population center suffers from a decline in population, crime rates increase.

         "While the total number of people killed was the lowest since 1966, today's homicide rate per capita is much higher than it was then. The city's population was 2.5 times larger in 1966.\n\nAn estimated 620,376 people live in Detroit, according to 2022 U.S. Census data. The homicide rate in 2023 was about 41 homicides per 100,000 residents. In 1966, when 1.58 million people lived in Detroit, the rate was roughly 15 homicides per 100,000 residents.\n\n[Detroit records fewest homicides since 1966, but rates remain high](https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2024/01/03/fewest-homicides-since-1966/72098581007/)",

         "Y'all aren't wrong about the drop in quality and the drive for short term profits, but you are being simplistic and missing part of the probable why. \n\nYes, there was a time when these huge chains had good food etc. They grew and profited in an era where local restaurants and bars tended to have shitty food and where being able to get the same menu cooked to a minimum standard in any city in America was a draw, something that large numbers of customers wanted. However, that era is long dead. \n\nSometime in the 90's and 2000s, local restaurants and bars that were actually good started being a thing. Then they become the norm. Probably not coincidentally, it became possible to use the Internet and mapping services to find restaurants in a given area, along with customer reviews - meaning even non-locals could find the local places that were worth going to. People who wanted good food didn't go to Fridays anymore rather than risk an unknown local place that was probably shit - they googled local gastro pubs and went there. \n\nAt some point, the writing was on the wall. Nothing these places did was going to complete with local + quality + a consumer culture that valued those things over national chains. Their base of loyal customers existed, but was going to die off, and they were not going to get replaced. \n\nAt this point, the goal of the companies changed from growing and maintaining market share, to making as much money as possible before they inevitably went bankrupt. Either they did this knowingly, or they floundered until the owners cashed out by selling to venture capitalists, who did have that goal. At which point the enshitification cycle started. They weren't going to out compete for customers who wanted good food, so they dropped food quality a little to save money. After this started having a negative impact, they dropped prices to match, and leaned into that marketing. Once they got a spike in customers from that, they dropped food quality again. Rinse repeat, close stores as necessary, and eventually go bankrupt - but that was always going to happen; the only questions were \"when\" and \"how much money can be made first.\"",

Not because they were busy because a server or two were late and they only had one server going until they showed.\n\nThen, as we got our table, a fire alarm, loudly started going off. The waiter said not to worry, this happens there all the time, and it would eventually stop, which it did about 5 minutes later. I ordered an App with our drinks then after the drinks were dropped ordered our entrees. The waiter never brought the App so I said something when our entrees were dropped.

This will always mean cheaper ingredients and lower wages, which in turns always leads to worse good and bad service. Eventually this will drive away the customer base and now you're in a spiral that can never be recovered from. Because the only way to fix it is to take a hit on profits in order to increase quality, but corporations simply won't ever do that.

They buy a restaurant with a good concept, promote franchises, then it runs its course as people's tastes change, they load it with debt, kill it, and start over. It's the circle of life\n\nAlso a few of them do seem to be doing better than others. They built a completely new free-standing Chili's from the ground up which I swear was no longer happening, and I also saw a completely new free-standing Outback Steakhouse too. Also they are bringing Bennigan's and Steak and Ale back.",
         "They expanded as much as they really could in the 80s-90s. Then the only way to grow profit was to cut costs and corners. So instead of a trained kitchen staff preparing meals, they're replaced with low paid employees who can microwave pre-made food for the right amount of time and over-cook a burger. The went from reliably good, to reliably ok, to crap.\n\nAt the same time. the internet and smartphones became ubiquitous, we all have the internet with us at all times and no matter where we are, we can find plenty of locally owned restaurants with plenty of reviews to reliably pick a good place to go. And the cheap chains have gotten more expensive, so the price difference to go for higher quality is less. I really can't grasp going to any of the national chains over a local place anymore.",

They trade in premium mediocrity and, more often than not, because of their enormous scale, the quality and experience is awful compared to the price.

Keep in mind the food before this time wasn\u2019t that great either, but you weren\u2019t expecting great food at TGIF.  You went there for bar food and for the fun/atmosphere.  \n\nThat was really the beginning of the end.  That marked the point in the road where it became TGISysco and everything became a basic protein slathered in some sugary sauce and pico, with a side of normal-ass fries or microwaved veggies.  \n\nIt never really found its identity again after that, instead decided to just trade punches with Darden restaurants, which is a damning fight.  They never tried to be TGIF, they just tried to be better than Applebees.  \n\nSad, really.",

Then it was another 10 before they came to take the food order, and over an hour to receive our plates. \n\nDuring that time I saw staff standing around, messing around on their phones, and even stepping outside for a smoke.

They pay shit wages, charge the customers way more than is reasonable, and wonder why they don't make money. \n\nI'll take my hard-earned money and eat at smaller local one-offs that are worthy.

That one lasted a couple more years, then the next one one closed a couple years after that. And even when they were open, it wasn't terribly shocking when they closed, because usually the place was nearly empty aside from the people sitting in the bar playing trivia or watching sports.\n\nIn less than a decade, we went from having half a dozen Fridays within 20 miles to having none within about 150 miles.",

Over here in Taiwan there's restaurants where you literally never interact with the server other than when they bring you food - get a table number from a machine out front, order via QR code, either pay online or pay right when the food is delivered, and you can leave when you're ready.

The only other option is to reduce food costs or labor costs. That means worse food or worse service, period. \n\nYou can't avoid this in the restaurant business. If you try to go too cheap on either side, local businesses will push you out because it is easy and cheap for them to do so while still making a profit even if that might be overall less than yours in theory. That's what all of the chain places are experiencing now. Very few are adapting, but the reality is because they can't. \n\nAs a corporation, they have to keep growing, and, there, is just always a low cap in restaurants more than other industries. So they are fucked.",
         "I think 20 to 30 years ago, food trends and market needs or desires allowed these types of places to flourish.  If you think about it, food diversity, availability, etc. was a lot lower in the 90s and even aughts.  Today, however, there are not only additional types of restaurants serving varieties of ethnic and/or \"craft\" foods, there are also a lot more places to eat, in general, so the viability of generic franchises serving standard - and not particularly delicious - \"American\" cuisine is in a lot lower demand.\n\nTastes have changed considerably over time.  In the 90s, I remember thinking a place like Red Lobster or Olive Garden was an exotic experience.  Granted, I was a kid so my frame of reference was narrow, but the perception of food was different, though I suppose that would somewhat depend on where you grew up.\n\nSome of that is not only exposure to various cuisines, but also the expansion of food \"culture,\" for instance.  Think of all the food programming available and how that has influenced people's tastes and desires.  Food Network was a big part of that, but even now Instagram and YouTube have further expanded a foodie culture.\n\nThe expanse of knowledge has led to people seeking out new and more satisfying experiences, or even being able to cook more elaborate meals at home.  This makes a lot of bland restaurants obsolete.  Things that were exotic or unique 30 years ago are no longer that interesting.  In some cases these restaurants haven't adapted to changes in that landscape, but in others there's not much you can do but become outmoded and fade out.",

So the older it is, the more it\u2019s been taxed.  You can have bottles of whiskey that end up being 10-15$ of just taxes.  \n\nAnd I\u2019m not saying this as anti-taxation.  It\u2019s a sin, it gets taxed.  Just trying to explain where some of the costs in spirits comes from.  \n\nWhat\u2019s really fun, is to go down the rabbit hole of loopholes in the spirits industry to avoid those taxes, legally.  Like rum.  The excise tax on Rum from Puerto Rico, largely goes back to Puerto Rico.  10$ of the 13$ tax per proof gallon goes back to PR.
