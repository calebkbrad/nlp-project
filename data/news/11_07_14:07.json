         "Oh I\u2019m sure there will totally be consequences",
         "[Former lawyer](https://www.reuters.com/legal/giuliani-loses-new-york-law-license-after-backing-trumps-false-2020-election-2024-07-02/) and[ indicted co-conspirator Rudy Giuliani](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/grand-jury-indicts-18-alleged-arizona-fake-elector-scheme-re-elect-trump-2024-04-24/) will appear in a New York City courtroom on Thursday to explain to a federal judge why he hasn\u2019t surrendered his valuables as part of a $148 million defamation judgment",
         "He'll be sweating more streams of hair dye.",
         "Giuliani got the all consequences Trump had earned for himself and was supposed to get",
         "Amazing that Rudy was one of the fall guys for Trump and was feeling the full extent of consequences. Meanwhile his boss, who is guilty of the exact same crimes, just floats his way right back into the whitehouse. F\\*cking hell America.",
         "I wonder is this POS is going to kiss the ring and get the ruling overturned",
         "And just like that, he was forgotten by Trump.",
         "I hope the bodies of all these old pieces of crap just give out on them",
         "Doesnt matter. HE just became untouchable. JUSTICE is dead in the U.S its only who has cash and power.",
         "Another dementia patient running around loose in the streets.",
         "Jail would be nice.  He could drive to Rikers in that Mercedes he's hiding from the people he ripped off. Make sure he leaves that Yankee ring in the glove compartment as well. Bastard.",
         "My god, this man literally gave up everything for Trump - His law Licenses, his dignity, his reputation and now he has to surrender his assets, Bizarre, you would think at some point he would have a come to Jesus moment and distanced himself from Trump before things got to this point. NOPE!",
         "This is the sort of crap red state judges jail people for when they can't make payments on their medical debt.",
         "I have no faith that justice will prevail.",
         "That can\u2019t happen - he\u2019s a friend of the president-elect.\n\nEDIT: Due to the re-election of world\u2019s greatest comic genius to highest office in the land, I will no longer use nor honor the /s tag. It\u2019s no-longer required because sarcasm and irony are dead. Thank you.",
         "It will be interesting to see what immunity he gets now",
         "his buddy will help him in january, he's gonna force it until then.",
         "put him in handcuffs and straight to jail and have the relevant constables remove his assets/orders to attach his bank holdings *while you still can* ...",
         "He\u2019ll get pardoned by Trump.",
         "US Supreme Court incoming: \"It's illegal to require Rudy Giuliani to appear in a court.\"",
         "He's trying to get it escalated to a federal court",
         "Makes sense why all these sfucker's knew they could get away with breaking the law",
         "Doesn't matter now. He'll get that sweet sweet pardon on day 1. That seems pretty obvious. Him and every single insurrectionist that is in prison right now will go free. Trump will also almost certainly try to pardon himself and declare official act when anyone challenges it. You can count on that.",
         "This dude deserves to have a big downfall.",
         "My only joy is watching him suffer slowly.",
         "I'm guessing his end game is to get pardoned or something. I wish there were a better way to make judgments actionable. So many wealthy criminals drag it out long enough and hide enough shit that they never end up paying the judgment.\n\n  \nLooking at you Alex Jones.",
         "This man was married to his cousin for nearly 15 years. [No, I'm not joking.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Giuliani#Marriages_and_relationships)",
         "All this shit about to be wiped out \u2026 thanks idiots",
         "Something tells me this judgement may be reversed. Also a pardon a couple of months down the road here isnt out of the question.",
         "He is waiting until Jan 26...",
         "TRUMP CAN'T HELP HIM.\n\nLordy people, get it through your thick skulls, this is a STATE CIVIL case and there's absolutely nothing Trump can do.",
         "I wonder if this idiot thinks Mango can pardon a civil suit.",
         "If anything it's the two former Georgia election workers who were awarded the massive judgment that are probably worried.",
         "When trump is fed up of his toys",
         "Trump: Look, Rudy, I need to have at least the appearance of propriety, so I can't help you. It's not a good look if I start my new term pulling some old-boys-network stuff. Oh, and also (laughs uncontrollably) I like people who didn't lose! \ud83e\udd23",
         "Well that\u2019s cheered me up",
         "So, is he even going to bother to show?",
         "He just needs a delay of a couple months. He\u2019ll be fine\u2026",
         "Why bother? We already know each and every criminal will be pardoned in minutes.",
         "Why is this man not in prison yet?\n\nFor that matter, why is our future president not in prison yet? The justice system is a scam. What a joke of a country.",
         "I'm unfamiliar with the American legal system... but, umm, deadline?  Shouldn't the police have civil forfeitured, like, the day of the sentencing?",
         "Giuliani knew he only had to wait. That man isn\u2019t paying a dime and he will be awarded with a comfortable administration position.",
         "Doesn't matter, he'll get pardoned by Trump soon, anyway. There's no consequences for any GOP politician, insurrectionist, or criminal of any kind.\n\nEdit: oh good, he can't be pardoned on this. Wow, a tiny ray of light in a dark, dark world.",
         "He is dragging his feat thinking trump will pardon him but the JOKE IS ON HIM again, lol.",
         "Can\u2019t Trump just make him a court jester and wash all the legal issues away, like the king he is?",
         "He\u2019s certain trump will put him on the supreme court.",
         "He could just not show up to court and literally nothing would happen",
         "He just has to hang on for dear life till Jan 6.",
         "Oh my god!  I can't wait to watch Giuliani waltz into court like a big shot all confident that emperor Trump will make this all disappear.  Then his jaw drops when he remembers that Trump NEVER reciprocates loyalty and Giuliani is the first sucker of Trump's second term to go to prison and languish there waiting for a pardon that will never come.",
         "He knows if he just holds out for two more months, he'll never have to surrender anything.",
         "So. Someone\u2019s getting a pardon.",
         "Narrator: \"there were no consequences\"",
         "No there won't!",
         "Trump won\u2019t rescue him. In his eyes, Giuliani has outlived his usefulness.",
         "\"Totally cool and totally legal.\"",
         "All these unjust and politically motivated trials will be over in January /s  it\u2019s not even sarcasm it\u2019s fucking real people, all their problems got away. It\u2019s really hard to believe in justice and karma when you look at the last 8 years of American circus justice and politics and then 70 millions or so citizens give them a pass. \ud83e\udd2f",
         "Don't worry, the 72D chess Harry Reid, Schumer, Pelosi, Muller and the rest have been playing will pay off here any day now... any.... day",

         "\"I'm delaying until Trump gets into the White House\"",
         "> will appear\n\nSo confident about the future. What are the odds that Guiliani simply doesn't show up and there are no consequences?",
         "The day before the election, I got a fundraising email from Giuliani, saying that I needed to donate to him to help him fight the Democrats who are trying to take away his home and his valuable, cherished possessions.\n\nI wonder how many people who got that email actually donated because of it.",
         "Will he drive his bullshit Mercedes to the hearing?",
         "Hair dye eh??? I just kind of figured it was like in the 5th Element where Zorg has the black shit coming out of his head.",
         "Musk is next on the fall guy list.",
         "Can you just imagine all those who supported the Fat Orange One that are now sitting in jail because of J6, attorneys who have been disbarred, those who have been sued and lost assets, all in support of the Fat Orange One. And what happened to the almighty one that they so vigorously supported? He\u2019s now elected to be the next President of the United States with all convictions and pending lawsuits likely to be dismissed.\n\nDumbasses.",
         "We can thank Democrats for Trump's election.  \n\n13 million Democrats stayed home on election day.\n\nBiden had 81 million.  Harris 68 million.",
         "I don\u2019t think he has anything left to offer Trump so I assume he\u2019ll get very little if any support there",
         "This is a civil defamation case.",
         "Fed can't interfere with a state civil matter. Unless he pulls some crazy moves (not out of the question). But that would mean that he likes Giuliani enough to do this which he doesn't. He used him up already, doesn't have anything to offer Trump.",
         "There\u2019s nothing Trump can do about this. It\u2019s a state case, and a civil one at that. Trump can only impact criminal cases at the federal level.",
         "Trump can't undo state crimes. But also this isn't a crime is Civil.",
         "It\u2019s a civil case under state jurisdiction. The president has no power in such matters.",
         "Who? Giuliani? In any event this is a civil defamation case so a pardon is irrelevant.",
         "This is a NY case and he's already been sentenced. And it's his cash and power they're coming after.",
         "Always has been",
         "I don\u2019t really think Trump would piss in Giuliani if he was on fire, of course I could be wrong but I\u2019d be surprised if he steps in to save him",
         "No he didn't.",
         "He's a public enough figure Trump might try to fix things up for him now that he is King. Rudy might have won out in the end.",
         "I hate how right you are",
         "What you're proposing is debtor's prison and that's not how civil judgment enforcement works in the US. If we could put him in jail for this then we'd also be jailing poor minorities for defaulting on their leases, car loans, and credit card bills.",
         "Can\u2019t get pardoned in state cases.\u00a0",
         "Trump just won without him. Giuliani is dead to him.",
         "Civil suit, pardoning him will not do anything.",
         "We get the distinction, however we've also seen crazy and unprecedented things happen with Trump and friends.\n\nSome of Trump's many criminal charges are state ones. Do you really think those are actually going to go forward with him as President? There is little hope of him facing justice now.\n\nIf he cares to help Giuliani out, one approach would be to appoint him to a federal political position, then make the case that he doesn't need to comply with state courts and can't be held in contempt because it would interfere with his federal duties. No precedent for that? No problem... we have an extremely favorable Supreme Court that can make that ruling!\n\nOr, we just streamline this whole thing and get a Supreme Court ruling that the President has the power to pardon state crimes and overrule state courts. It's fucking insanity, and yet no one would be surprised because we've seen everything else that's been happening.\n\nThe real question is if Giuliani is still useful to Trump or not. If he's not, then he'll be left to burn like all the others.",
         "Just like he couldn't keep piles of classified documents basically just hanging out. Or use his office to promote products. Or try to have his supporters overturn an election....",
         "He'll die of cirrhosis of the liver by then?",
         "It is absolutely disgusting that anybody would be actually cheering on the vile practice of civil asset forfeiture. Your hate blinds you.",
         "It's a State and civil matter, not federal. The President cannot pardon someone for those things.",
         "This isn't something they can pardon. Lawsuits, state charges, etc. Cannot be pardon by a sitting president. That's why trump won't be able to pardon himself from the Georgia case.",
         "Not Federal charges, Trump can't help him. Not that he would.",
         "Or he comes to the realization that Trump can't help him on state civil cases.",
         "They better get all the assets before Trump takes over",
         "pardon soon!",
         "Irrelevant in a civil state case.",
         "Trump hasn't even paid him for 2020 lol. I would honestly be shocked if Trump lifted a single finger to help him",
         "It's definitely a possibility",
         "fingers crossed",
         "He oughta know not to stand by the window.",
         "I wish",
         "Ah yes, lets blame the people actively trying to do something about it, instead of the 70 million who saw this happen and actively voted for more of this.\n\nI swear Trump could shoot someone in public, and not just nobody would care, people would blame the Democrats for it. Because they were the ones trying to have more gun control, so them failing to take the gun from Trump is clearly the problem, and Trump & co bear no responsibility.",
         "Trump's just gonna say he never even met him",
         "It\u2019s going to be so funny watch JD Vance do this to Trump.  \n  \nElon and Vance are just waiting now for the right moment to throw him overboard. \n  \nWatch it start with RFK either not getting the position he wanted or nothing at all.",
         "That's the real fun of watching people align themselves with a narcissist... They take great personal risk to support them in the hopes of reward, only to be left hanging when they really need it, because they're no longer useful and got dropped like a bad habit.\n\nJust look at how many former Trump allies ended up as convicted criminals, and instead of helping them in any way, he distances himself from them because they have nothing left to offer him.",
         "That's my hope about everyone. Rudy,  RFK, Elon (though that relationship is probably not changing), Jan 6 people. He doesn't need them anymore. Trump will never speak of them again. He's got the power now.",
         "Yeah, but he might still do it own the libs and give his base some revenge fantasy spank bank material.",
         "Failure to comply with court ordered results of that civil case would be criminal and pardonable and that's what is in discussion right?",
         "Pretty sure by \"HE\" they're referring to Trump",
         "Rules rules rules, why do you think those matter anymore?",
         "He wasn't sentenced. He lost his civil case and will probably be found in contempt of court. \n\nThe only successfully appealed contempt case I can think of was Yung Thug's lawyer in Georgia, and that was blatant judicial misconduct.",
         "Anythng can happen.  9-8-2023: https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-hosts-a-100000-per-person-fundraiser-to-help-giuliani-pay-legal-bills",
         "If trump being elected didn't teach you there is no Justice, hell or laws at all, except for what influence can bring, then I dont know what you tell you.",
         "Nor for civil cases, which this is.",
         "Yep. This is why Trump kept trying to get all his cases moved to Federal Court, so he could pardon himself.",
         "This is a feral thing, but it's still just a civil case and not a criminal one.",
         "Do we really think Trump is going to keep respecting that distinction especially when he has state charges/convictions against himself? \n\nTrump is going to pardon himself and anyone else he feels like of state crimes and challenge the states to do anything about it. SCotUS will back him up, congress will legislate laws to help him do this if he needs to. Hell we might actually see a constitutional amendment specifically to get that done. ha\n\nI hate to break it to you but part of the rise of fascism is the complete failure of and capitulation of institutions, beuocracy, and any sembelance of legal law. Its all going to be vibes and what the leader at the top feels.",
         "You are right but that doesn\u2019t mean trump won\u2019t try",
         "Why\u2753\ufe0f he has no further use for him. If he did, he would have had his idiot followers send him some greenbacks.",
         "Trump is irrelevant when it comes to civil cases.  He can\u2019t pardon.",
         "Jesus, people are still going on thinking he can be pardoned. He can't.",
         "But, like, what if he just doesn't comply and instead takes refuge in the White House when Trump is president? Can any state really touch him if he does that?",
         "I think you are about to be surprised how little that matters.",
         "I don't think that will stop Trump, the Supreme Court gave him Dictator power, and he will use it, have fun U.S.A, you're in for a wild ride.",
         "Lol, as if this country has laws.\n\nY'all are honestly pitiful, continuing to cling to your precious \"laws\". All that is over.",
         "I know it's supposed to work that way, but is there really anything stopping the President from calling the judge of a civil case and going, \"I would really, REALLY like it if the case turned out how I want it to.\"? Would some random judge be able to resist that kind of pressure? Would a judge who's already voting Republican anyway?",
         "> to explain to a federal judge\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a state case.",
         "I don\u2019t have any faith that institutional barriers are going to hold after he takes office. People keep saying that he won\u2019t be able to do this, and he won\u2019t be able to do that; but he\u2019s going to have the Presidency, the majority of the Supreme Court, the Senate and most likely the House as well. I fully expect there to be showdowns when state authorities conflict with the wants of the Federal Government.",
         "Ah, you're used to the old America.  Welcome to a whole new style of governing where one party is in complete control and can simply ignore any guardrails that are still in place.\n\nWelcome to the mafia running the country, putting intense pressure on anyone who doesn't play ball.  People are going to be fired left and right for standing up against it.  Those people will not have any recourse or anyone else willing to defend them in court.",
         "Can he order the courts to deem the trial invalid for whatever made up reason, then have it tried again, and have it so the judge can make it so they only get a token $1 award? Or so they lose? Could Giuliani request a trial by judge on a civil case? Or can the judge legally overturn the jury's decision? Or simply never call the case to trial?",
         "As if Trump couldn't give him a $200m contract for some shit he never has to deliver on.\n\nHe probably won't want to, because he's as disloyal as he is dumb, but he could.",
         "Unless whatever he wants to do is within the outer perimeter of a president's official duties.\n\nAccording to the supreme court.",
         "For now. Under Trump fascism (thanks MAGA and non voters) the constitution would just be change to allow him to pardon or sentence whoever he wants.",
         "What\u2019s anyone going to do? If Trump wants to save him he will. Nobody will stop him.",
         "He helped me, some of my staff knew him but I never really liked the guy and we didn\u2019t talk much.\n\nTrump loves tossing people under the bus based on public\u2019s reaction.",
         "\"He got me covfefe once\"",
         "For once, when he says that \"Giuliani was terrible,\", he'll be telling the truth.",
         "\"Definitely not my type. He wouldn't be the chosen one.\"",
         "He was just a low-level covfefe boy.",
         "They don't need him to step down. They'll just wheel him out on the golf course and the Heritage Foundation will quietly assume control.\u00a0",
         "I genuinely can\u2019t tell if that thought makes me any happier or just more terrified for the future",
         "He has to give some of them something, or no one will want to work with or for him again.\n\nMore likely they'll come in for a while, say something Trump doesn't like (well Rudy won't as he knows the ropes) and then be forced to resign or such.",
         "Maybe but he\u2019s not eligible for a second term. All of these people are useless to him now. Maybe he will intervene in some way for Giuliani, idk, but I think his sights are set on his next grifts and no helping out anyone else",
         "It's civil. It's only civil and the court can put him in jail without him being convicted of a felony. Pardons have no standing in state cases (depending on the state constitution, and since this is a new york court then laws will definitely not enforce a presidential pardon even though there is still no standing for it). Pardons have no standing for civil cases either. \n\nThere might be other ways for the defendants to get what they want without jailing him like garnishing wages or state level seizure of assets to be sold to the highest bidder. All of this is not pardonable. \n\nBut clearly, this is the year of crazy so who knows what's going to happen...",
         "It would be a state matter, not federal so again not pardonable by the president.",
         "He already lost his condo which is arguably the biggest single asset he has visible.  It won't ever be justice but Ruby and Shaye will get something.",
         "It's a state matter. Trump isn't magically going to be a king now that he's elected. He has no jurisdiction to pardon state matters.\n\nObviously he can influence it quite a bit if he really wants with state and federal relations. But he can't just pardon stuff.",
         "It would likely be contempt of court which is really kind-of it's own thing. He could actually be jailed indefinitely until such time as he agrees to take the actions necessary to transfer the ownership of the property in question.  The indefinite term is allowable because he \"holds the key to his own release\" in that he need only cooperate with a judgement that's already been rendered.\n\nWhether this is pardonable would depend on the state constitution since this is a state matter and not a federal one.  I can't imagine it is, and nobody in NY in a position to do it is going to pardon him of this, anyway.\n\nWhere it gets weird is if he holds actual federal office.  In many cases, states do not have the authority to jail people if it would prevent them from discharging their duties as a federal officer.  If he were appointed to some significant federal office, especially one requiring legislative confirmation such as a cabinet member, he'd probably have a decent argument to \"get out jail free\" so that he could perform his duties of such office.  He'd still be liable for the judgement including any accruing penalties.",

         "He will still make sure the government doesn\u2019t touch him once he is president",

         "Before starting the new line, they need to make sure the train tickets are not more expensive than the airplane tickets for same distance.",
         "I took Amtrak from California to Chicago this summer.  It was pretty amazing. Long haul routes on Amtrak should be consider more like a ocean cruise where you are in it for the experience versus just a ideal fast means of travel.    \n\nFun fact.  In the midwest, a ton of Amish ride Amtrak.  At one point it seemed like half my fellow train passengers were Amish.  They conveniently ignore the whole diesel and electric part of modern trains.",
         "People who are disparaging this as \u201coh great, a slow but expensive service\u201d, think of this as something someone else might prefer (more room, less hassle for onboarding and deboarding, more leisurely, less carbon footprint, etc.) In some first world countries, long distance travel with trains is a good experience and we should demand more like that instead of bashing this as pointless.",
         "For when you want to take 3 days to get somewhere instead of 3 hours.",
         "How long until Amtrak is on Elon\u2019s chopping block?",
         "I wonder how much of this is to limit brightline from expanding.  Private commercial passenger rail isn\u2019t allowed to compete with Amtrak on routes they offer. Brightline picked their routes because Amtrak wasn\u2019t offering service there at the time. \n\nThe semi-governmental corporate status of Amtrak makes some of its motives dubious.",
         "All I want is high speed trains to take me anywhere in this country and see the country by train would be dope, trains are cooked.",

         "The only time I take a train is from central PA to New York.  Flying that distance would be stupid (especially as I'd probably need to get to Philly anyway), and at least that corridor has relatively fast speeds.  \n\nI've considered it for other trips, but it boggles my mind how train travel can be slower *and* more expensive than flying. *And* busses in many cases.  The only advantage is no security line, but whatever that saves is eaten up by the travel time.",

I love trains, but every time I need to go further than 300 miles, a flight is almost always a cheaper option. There is no easy way to make long distance train travel make sense economically. Maybe in Europe, with their population density, but not in the USA.",
         "Is it a bullet/speed train? Or is the USA still stuck in the 1990's?",
         "Trains in Europe are super efficient, quick, fairly priced and you have the bonus of not having to travel out of the city center to an airport and go through extensive security. Trains here are just slow and expensive. Took a train from Florida to DC, horrible experience, slow and boring should have just driven or flown there was no point in taking the train.",

I was able to lay down on the bed (though I was exactly the same height as the length of the bed, which wasn't great). The scenery was beautiful, my wife felt a lot more at ease, and I think it ended up being cheaper (we booked like two days before we left, as it was a sudden trip).

Based on a quick Google, Amtraks yearly subsidy is around 2 billion or less. It's a fraction of other modes of transportation and largely benefits Republican areas. Some people in some political parties may not care about their constituents, but enough would to prevent dismantling or defunding Amtrak significantly. On top of this, some of Amtrak is funded by States and this would at least protect routes confine to an individual state and potentially up to a State or two.",

Amtrak has had to make decisions for decades on the basis of profitability when it has been sorely underfunded since its creation.  It's like complaining that your roof leaks, but only being able to make improvements that stop the leaks instead of replacing the whole roof.  \n\nAnd then on the flip side, if we are going to complain about it making decisions that might encroach on for profit entities, it is making competition by acting like a for profit entity itself.  \n\nLike I get that you think it should be one or the other, either government or for profit, but it is not dubious when Amtrak is working within the unique constraints of its creation.",
         "My understanding is that railroads that shed their passengers services to Amtrak aren't allowed to compete with Amtrak on intercity passenger routes, but that doesn't apply to new entrants or to railroads that didn't transfer passenger services to Amtrak. Brightline was (and will remain) fine because the Florida East Coast Railway discontinued passenger service in 1968 and thus never shifted passenger operations to Amtrak and thus isn't bound by any such agreement.\n\nRealistically, no one actually wants to compete with Amtrak anyway, as outside of the North East Corridor, there's clearly no profit to be found, and even within the North East Corridor the costs associated with track upgrades are such that it's not likely to be much of a booming business. \n\nBrightline was able to carve out a niche for itself by operating in a place that has enough large cities to support rail, but where political considerations had largely driven it out previously.",

The only real changes are that people going from the Northeast to inland North Carolina or Tampa will have to transfer in Washington and people going from the Midwest to those places *won't* have to make that transfer, and they're planning to revert to the current services once the tunnel construction is done and they've had the chance to rotate the current western long-distance fleet through heavy maintenance.",

So, Boston-NYC-Philly-Washington, LA-San Diego, or any metro area. \n\nThis is the bulk of human transportation anyway. Planes make sense from NYC to LA. That's why there's still air travel inside Europe even when the rail network is fairly good in many countries.",

Flight would definitely be more expensive.\n\nIf you\u2019re talking about convenience then high speed rail would solve that. Some parts of the world have trains going over 200mph, which is about 1/3 the speed of a plane. When you factor in the time at airports and security, the difference in time becomes smaller (not negligible, but manageable). \n\nIf the US wants to implement a rail system, I would argue that it makes sense to use it in conjunction with our already robust air system. Use plane to/from major cities, then train to/from minor outlying towns. \n\nAlso as a frequent coach class air traveler, I would absolutely 100% take a train instead of a plane if the difference in cost/time was reasonable.

Door-to-door air travel for the same route would be 5-7 hours depending on traffic.\n\nChicago to LA would be more like 12 hours, so a sleeper car option for that could have you show up in the evening and arrive in LA first thing in the morning. You're looking at 7-8 hrs door-to-door at the low end for air travel, but it could be as much as 10hrs in heavy traffic. So even then it wouldn't be completely blown out.\n\nI think you underestimate how much time it takes to travel to an airport, have to arrive early to get through security, etc. That adds a significant amount of time to the overall trip.",

The people taking them as a regular means of transportation are generally going to and from other places along the route.\n\nSecond, this isn't actually a new service, but a combination of two existing services (the Capitol Limited from Chicago to Washington and the southern part of the Silver Star from New York to Miami) to free up capacity in New York for Amtrak and New Jersey Transit's regional services while there's major construction on the Hudson River tunnels and free up the equipment currently running on the Capitol Limited for the busier western long-distance routes. Offering a one-seat ride between Chicago and Miami is just a side effect of the actual purpose of the change, and it's planned to revert to the current two separate trains once the tunnel construction in New York and heavy maintenance on the western long-distance fleet is done.",

What I didn't realize is that the bus would pick up short-trip folks on either side of the route.  \n\nI remember looking out the window and looking at the Nashville skyline approach for about 3 or 4 hours while the bus driver kept getting out his maps and stopping for people at various small-town locations along the way.

Conductor wandered through checking tickets a bit later, was just a quick QR scan and was never bothered again.  There was very little noise, reasonably smooth ride, roughly as fast as driving without needing to.  Stops were actually surprisingly quick.  It was cheaper for round trip tickets and a Ventra pass than parking would have been for the few days I was there.  \n\n\nThat all said, longer lines may play out differently since the line I was on was a dedicated daily run between GRR and CHI, but as a solo traveler who wasn't in a hurry, it was honestly great.\n\n9/10, would train travel again.",

I had a shitty college student car that couldn't reliably make the full drive, so my only option was train. It was still RIDICULOUSLY expensive for a fuckikg train compared to my traveling in Japan, Korea, and France, but it was still the best available option to me due to some specific circumstances at that time.\n\nI wish the US had better train networks.

That distance is so great that you either need to plan for stops or just fly.  Rail, even HSR, will probably never be the solution there.\n\nHSR is a great medium range solution -  the sweet spot is more on the order of getting from Chicago to Minneapolis in 2-3 hours or Seattle to San Francisco in 4-5.",
         "I agree with the point that Chicago to Miami is a dumb plan.  However, I disagree strongly that high speed rail can't work in the US.

         "Taking a train in Japan from Tokyo to Kagoshima-Chuo is 1300 kilometers. But nobody rides that entire distance on the Shinkansen because a plane is 3 times faster. Yet the trains are decently filled up and profitable anyway, *because* there are many stations en route where people can get on and off. So *a lot* of people use a part of the route, even though very few use the full length of the route.\n\nLikewise, there are trains between Milan and Paris - in fact, there are two different companies operating competing passenger trains on the route. But most people do not ride the full length; they either ride from Paris to Lyon or to one of the stations in the alps between Lyon and Milan, or else they go from Lyon all the way to Milan. That's exactly the strength of a train - it can serve many partial routes.\n\nThere are *plenty* of places in the US where HSR would work. Of course it's never going to be viable in the Dakotas, and cross-country travel wouldn't be the niche either. But the entire Northeast and Midwest could easily be connected with HSR, and in fact the Midwest has similar population distribution and density as France. Chicago-St Louis is about the same distance as Paris-Lyon. You could build a route going Chicago-Indianapolis-Columbus-Pittsburgh-Baltimore, connecting to the northeast corridor in Baltimore. Cleveland could also be served by a spur. Detroit should be connected to the Canadian urban corridor. Tucson-Phoenix is a no-brainer; Arizona has a highly urbanised population and is ideal for HSR. Portland-Seattle-Vancouver should be a thing too.\n\nSmaller cities can also benefit from HSR and this does happen in most countries that have it, too. You don't need to stop all trains on all stations. A corridor Atlanta-Greenville-Charlotte could make sense too, and would also enable New York-Atlanta sleeper services that could depart late in the evening and arrive pretty early in the morning.",
         "8 hours would be competitive coast to coast. Best case with a plane its going to be about 6-7, but more likely you'll have a connection that pushes it over 8.\n\nIf it was reliably only 20% longer than flying you'd have no problem filling up the corridor. Train rides are infinitely more pleasant- you can move around, full sized seats, cafe cars, etc. 12 hours would probably be close enough to sell the seats, but 40 hours at twice the price is never going to be more than a niche.",

Many of the non-profitable lines are nevertheless operated by profitable companies because the deficit on the rail line allows massive profit on the real estate business.\n\nThere are also many unprofitable lines in Japan, which are subsidised by the prefectural governments. These are often described as \"private railways\" since they're technically operated by a private company... which is then wholly or majority owned by the prefectural government.\n\nYes, public transit should be profitable, but profitability should not be the goal - the goal should be to provide excellent service and thus encourage good urban development, improving quality of life, and attracting passengers. Because if profitability becomes the main goal, that will often result in cost-cutting which leads to fewer passengers and a downward spiral.",

Now, that's a lot and you're driving a kia, so let's say it's the medical/moving rate at $0.22. $308. Add in a hotel (motor lodge, about $60), tolls (tollsmart says $35 w/o transponder) and you're not getting up to $700, but you're getting pretty close.  \nAlso, if we weren't heavily subsidizing these highways, they'd all be toll roads, which would make this trip actually be around $700, but we do, so that's a non factor.",

You're not getting home by train the same night, so it doesn't really work well if your plan is to attend a concert, sporting event, or other live event.\n\nAlso, it's about $40 per person each way, so if you're traveling even with one other person, it's much more economical to drive.\n\nBut if your plan is to spend a few car-free days in Portland when you live near Seattle (or vice versa), then it's a fun option, if not always the most economical or convenient.",

         "Oh if it had those unscheduled issues that stinks. There just have been major problems and they didn't explain anything.\n\nExpress service with fewer stops definitely reduces the total transit time though, which is why they do it.

         "Yeah, \"most of the rail\" is really like 99.8% of it.  I think  outside of light rail inside cities, subways and a small section of rail owned by a southern state (georgia?), the rest is all privately owned.\n\nI agree with your points so don't take what I just said as a rebuttal.  More like clarification",
         "This is not actually the case. Amtrack legally has the right of way, as by US law, Freight must yield to passenger rail whenever possible. So the Freight companies made their trains longer than their sidings on Amtrak routes so that it was never possible for them to yield.\n\nIt's a loophole that needs to be closed.",

         "I'll give you that. We've usually wanted to overnight at our destination without our car. Especially when snow is expected.",
         "That's good to know that most aren't as bad as I thought. The Tacoma stop used to be rough but is way better now that it has moved to Freight House Square like the Sounder.\n\nHonestly I really would like Olympia to just get better rail infrastructure. I've commented on  the local sub, but it would be great to see the low traffic rails that run downtown get upgraded to a Sounder stop.",
         "Most people only know Vancouver BC",
         "My wife and I just had this convo while we were driving in Chicago the other day. So many people hate driving in Chicago, but I actually think it's worse driving in a lot of other places. I don't generally feel like I'm in danger of getting hit while I'm driving down there like I do in a lot of other places.",
         "There's definitely an element of intercity rail travel that hinges on getting to the destination and having the local transit not be \"You have 1 bus, it comes on Tuesday. Now what, asshole?\"",
         "It's those up-to-400 mile distances where trains do really well and where Amtrak should be focussing on for any upgrades. \n\nI'm in the UK. Our high speed rail isn't like the TGV or Shinkansen - it runs at 125mph over the same routes that have been in place since Victorian times. Upgrade the rails themselves, and either smooth out the more egregious curves, build up a good cant on the curves, or use tilting trains, and you can run 125mph high speed trains on your existing right of way. \n\nLondon to Edinburgh or Glasgow in Scotland is about 400 miles up the east or west coast. A 125mph train with a few stops takes just over four hours, which as you say is pretty competitive with flying. A train is downtown to downtown whereas with flying you have to get to and from the airport and factor in all the extra time needed for checking in and security. \n\nIt's why the Northeast Corridor is so successful - instead of publishing endless proposals for hugely expensive new build HSR, why shouldn't Amtrak concentrate on upgrading existing routes to the kind of quality of the NEC?",
         "Having taken that train from Pontiac to Minneapolis, I'd much rather just drive. There are a few benefits, but the costs of those benefits are just not worth the trade-off. I'll pay for parking if I arrive 6 hours earlier. 6 hours X my hourly rate at work= not worth the trade off.",
         "Two months ago we did Dearborn to Chicago, and it was definitely one of our best trips as far as the actual traveling. \n\nOur only issue was a family of 3 and it was two seats.  The way back from Chicago was completely full, so we had to get someone to move so my wife and son could sit together while I sat with a stranger.",
         "Lansing to Chicago isn\u2019t bad either. Not having to deal with tolls and parking is nice.",
         "Yeah I probably shouldn't joke. I was living on Ft. Lewis at the time and that was a really rough week",
         "I don't see how that's relevant to what I said. Pontiac to Minneapolis is literally double the distance compared to Pontiac to Chicago. At that point, just fly."

The Respect for Marriage Act says that the federal government will recognize same-sex marriages, and that states have to recognize same-sex marriages performed by other states in the US, but it does not require states to actually perform them!\n\nIf *Obergefell* were overturned by the Supreme Court, there are about 30 states in the US where same-sex marriage would then be banned, either by state law or by the state Constitution. Colorado is now no longer one of them.",

         "Yay! Subaru\u2019s for everyone!",
         "Yeah, this is a crucial distinction that many people overlook. The Respect for Marriage Act is an important step because it protects already-existing marriages across state lines, but it doesn\u2019t fully secure the right to same-sex marriage nationwide if Obergefell is overturned. If Obergefell falls, same-sex couples in around 30 states could lose the right to marry within their own states, putting their rights entirely at the mercy of state legislatures or constitutions.\n\nThis situation exposes a broader issue: without a Supreme Court ruling or a comprehensive federal law guaranteeing marriage equality, these rights remain vulnerable. The potential for a patchwork system, where some states permit same-sex marriage and others don\u2019t, would create significant legal and personal hardships for couples\u2014especially those living in or moving between restrictive states. Ultimately, this highlights the need for clear, nationwide protections that don\u2019t rely solely on Supreme Court precedents, which can shift with changes in the Court\u2019s makeup.",
         "Obergefell was decided in 2016. Lawrence v Texas was 2003. \n\n\nChevron was 1984, and Roe was 1973\u2013we saw what happened with those. \n\nLots of states still have anti-sodomy laws on the books.",
         "This is why I left Texas. I knew the moment Trump got elected the first time that Obergefell was in danger, and then when Roe went down and Clarence mentioned that Obergefell should also be struck down, that's when I started looking for a way out.\n\nVery happy I took it seriously.",
         "If Obergefell is overturned the scotus will find some way to overturn the RMA. Marriage equality is dead as soon as they find some way to challenge it in Amarillo",
         "Ah yeah good stuff. Typical right wing politics. Just let the states decide on a whim whether a fundamental human right applies or not. Oh *it's not like I'm against it* \ud83d\ude09 *but if a state wants to allow it that's their business, of course if they want to forbid it I respect that decision* \ud83d\ude09.\n\nThese fucking mongrels. States rights has always been a smokescreen to stop giving people more rights.",
         "So 30 states didn\u2019t bother because before nobody thought the SC would start overturning rights previously granted by the SC willy nilly.",
         "I got a different answer on a different thread to this - but based on the wording of your post, it sounds like if Obergefell were overturned, the RMA would still federally recognize marriages performed in another state, even if their home state refuses to perform one.\n\nIs that true?  Somebody told me in another thread that it would only recognize same-sex marriages that happened *up until that point* but not any new ones after.  That is not the impression I'm getting",

         "Also important why we pass the equal protection amendment to the constitution so the court cant do anything to rights.",
         "Problem is the GOP will introduce a Federal Ban on same sex marriage and the chances of it passing are great because the constitution doesn't matter. I know Colorado went blue and like another blue state I feel for them, they should know it's only a stop-gap because Yes, Obergefell will be overturned so you will at least have a year or so of having a legal marriage I guess.",

Would you rather the majority party, or rather, the party YOU align with, be able to remove opposition at will.

They need to stoke the flames and rebuild their voting base by running an actual opposition campaign.\n\nAs an example of the disconnect I'm talking about, in the 2022 gubernatorial race, the democrats ran Charlie Christ - the formerly Republican ex-governor - in a \"return to normalcy\" campaign against DeSantis.

United States](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24781904-fischer-v-united-states)\u00a0\u2014 significantly narrowing a key statute used to charge and convict numerous Jan. 6 defendants for obstructing the official duties of lawmakers certifying the election.

The defendants asked the court to overturn their guilty verdicts in light of Fischer. In August, the government responded \u2014 opposing the motion but conceding that the operative legal elements no longer supported their felony convictions under federal law.\n\nIn early October, in\u00a0[an exasperated order](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25277448-carnell-bowman-vacatur-order), \\[Judge\\] Howell summed up the state of the case: \u201cThe peculiar situation presented is that the parties have no agreed-upon path to correct the error of relying on now-invalid elements to which the parties stipulated for the findings of guilt.\u201d\n\nIn the end, the court vacated the convictions, pointedly denied the requests to reverse the guilty verdicts, and directed the defense and the prosecution to sort out how things should move forward.\n\nLeft to argue among themselves, no resolution was reached.

         "* Scholz sacks finance minister Lindner over budget disputes\n* Scholz expected to lead minority government with Social Democrats and Greens\n* To hold confidence vote in January triggering snap elections\n* Political shake-up could benefit populist movements such as AfD\n* Scholz to ask opposition conservatives for support\n\nBERLIN, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Germany's ruling coalition collapsed on Wednesday as Chancellor Olaf Scholz sacked his finance minister and paved the way for a snap election, triggering political chaos in Europe's largest economy hours after Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election. After sacking Finance Minister Christian Lindner of the Free Democrats (FDP) party, Scholz is expected to head a minority government with his Social Democrats and the Greens, the second-largest party.\n\nHe would have to rely on cobbled-together parliamentary majorities to pass legislation and he plans to hold a parliamentary confidence vote in his government on Jan. 15, which could trigger snap elections by the end of March. Scholz said he would ask Friedrich Merz, leader of the opposition conservatives who are far ahead in polls, for support in passing the budget and boosting military spending. Merz is due to respond in a Thursday morning news conference.\n\n  \nThe collapse of Scholz's three-way alliance caps months of wrangling over budget policy and Germany's economic direction, with the government's popularity sinking and far-right and far-left forces surging.\" We need a government that is able to act, that has the strength to make the necessary decisions for our country,\" Scholz told reporters. Scholz said he fired Lindner for his obstructive behaviour on budget disputes, accusing the minister of putting party before country and blocking legislation on spurious grounds.\n\n  \nThe move comes a day after the election of Republican [Donald Trump](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/donald-trump/) as U.S. president, with Europe scrambling to form a united response on issues from possible new U.S. tariffs to Russia's war in Ukraine and the future of the NATO alliance. The government crisis comes at a critical juncture for Germany, with a flatlining economy, aging infrastructure and an unprepared military. A political shake-up could fuel growing frustration with Germany's mainstream parties to the benefit of younger populist movements, including the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD). With France also facing political uncertainty after snap elections this year, turmoil in the European Union's two largest economies could hamper efforts to deepen the bloc's integration at a time when it is facing challenges from east and west.\n\n# DEBT BRAKE SUSPENSION DEMAND\n\n  \nThe coalition has been at odds over how best to rescue Europe's largest economy, which is facing its second year of contraction and a crisis in its economic model after the end of cheap gas from Russia following its 2022 invasion of Ukraine and amid increasing competition from China. \n\nScholz said he had proposed capping energy costs for companies to bolster Germany's appeal as a place to do business. He wanted a package to help save jobs in the ailing auto industry, as well as increased support for Ukraine.\n\nThe FDP [had proposed](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/german-finance-minister-proposes-rival-economy-plan-document-shows-2024-11-01/) public spending cuts, lower taxes and less regulation as the answer to the malaise. It also wants to slow Germany's shift to a carbon-neutral economy.\n\nSpeaking after Scholz, Lindner said the chancellor had tried to strong-arm him into breaking a constitutionally-enshrined spending limit known as the debt brake, a move that Lindner, a fiscal hawk, refused to support.\n\nGovernment sources said Scholz had wanted to increase a Ukraine support package by 3 billion euros ($3.22 billion) to 15 billion euros and to finance it by suspending the debt brake.\"\n\nOlaf Scholz refuses to recognise that our country needs a new economic model,\" Lindner told reporters. \"Olaf Scholz has showed he doesn't have the strength to give his country a new boost.\"\n\nThe SPD and the Greens, while at odds on some issues, agree that targeted government spending is needed.\n\nThe three other FDP ministers - for transport, justice, and education - all voluntarily left the government.\n\nScholz said Lindner was focused on the short-term survival of his own party. \"Especially today, one day after such an important event as the U.S. elections, this kind of selfishness is utterly incomprehensible.\"\n\nEconomy Minister Robert Habeck of the Greens said the coalition could not agree on how to plug a funding gap in the budget for next year.\"I want to say on our behalf that tonight feels wrong and doesn\u2019t feel right. It\u2019s almost tragic on a day like today, when Germany needs to show unity and capacity for action in Europe.\"",
         "If anyone is interested, this is the current expectation of how a vote would go down going by various sources which are compounded here: https://www.wahlrecht.de/umfragen/\n\nCDU/CSU (conservatives) 32-36%\t\t\n\nSPD\t(social democrats, government) 14-16%\t\n\nGR\u00dcNE (greens, government) 10-12%\t\n\nFDP (Liberals, government) 3-5%, note you need to reach 5% of the votes to be able to gain any seats in the German Parliament.\n\nDIE LINKE\t(far left wing party, partially the former East German State party)\t2-3% \n\nAfD (far right wing, de facto our fascist party) 16-18%\n\t\nBSW (new splinter from die Linke, far left wing populist party VERY pro Russian) 7-11%\n\nSo it looks like the conservatives will win (note the CDU is the party of Angela Merkel and is very pro EU, USA, NATO, so not to be confused with American conservatives, even if they also sadly have become more populist post Merkel era) and form a coalition either with the social democrats (called grand coalition) or with the greens. We will probably get a new record high of extremist parties (AfD + BSW = around 25-30%) but they will definitely not be in the government.",

         "Into power? They won't. AfD have been stuck at 17% for months. Even if they manage to squees another few percentage points out of this (which remains to be seen), it won't bring them very far. The other parties aren't fascist, and noone wants to work with AfD. Germany will remain a democratic and reasonable country no matter which of the other parties are in charge.

It is time to spend. It is time to prop up the economy, and to invest in climate friendly infrastructure, and social programs. Yes it means adding debt. Shocker: Everyone is adding debt but us. Our budget is a rounding in the budget of the US. I'm not saying we need to add trillions in debt, but the current path is ridiculous. We can't function this way.

This led to election day ballots that were 7, 8+ pages long since the full text of each one was printed so you either did a lot of reading in the voting booth, or a lot of prep work going through all the issues.

The first major test was the anti-gay marriage constitutional amendment which by the way passed in **2008** with **62% -** in a year the state went for Obama at 51%.

Every single time the dems are in charge the rate of growth of the US national debt goes down. Every time the GOP is in charge the debt starts growing (faster and faster even). That's the telltale sign of republicans just borrowing money to fund more and more tax cuts, and dems slowly getting back to a balanced budget that can be sustained. The GOP gives everyone gifts and when the problems finally start catching up to them, they just dump the bill on de democrats who have to figure out how to pay for it all.",

The fact that prices never came back down in any significant way was a killer.

Their entire platform is built on not trusting media and they are fully incentivised to lie and say they'd vote democrat because that makes it look worse for Trump and they convert what looked like one vote for Harris into two votes for Trump. And the reality is the focus on minority groups isn't going to work because minority groups and well...a minority.

The reasons are many and complex, but much of it is due to the disappearance of old-growth forests and the increased reliance on tree farms with much younger trees. In the 1940s, most construction lumber was cut from trees that were decades old, today they may be as young as 9 years old. As a result, the 2x4s in the commons bin in a typical American lumberyard are cut from small, fast-growing trees, mostly \"white wood\" (SPF on the stamp, spruce, pine, fir).\n\n\n\u00a0With younger trees being lumbered, many mills have relaxed grading standards.\u00a0 The folks I have talked to who buy lumber from and for lumberyards consistently tell me that what we consider #2 grade lumber today (a common construction grade) would have been classified as #3 not long ago. Furthermore, boards are not graded for twists and bows. Carpenters are expected to \"crown\" the studs in a wall so the boards all bow in the same direction and the wall appears flat. The result is that even though the wood may be suitable for construction, the overall appearance of common 2x4s sucks dead toads.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0And if the lumber's appearance is not bad enough, there are other problems you may encounter that are not so visible: \ufeff\ufeffFast-growth wood is more likely to rot. \ufeff\ufeffYoung trees have poor dimensional stability - they may even shrink lengthwise. \ufeff\ufeffThe sugar in the sapwood may attract fungi and insects If the wood is dried quickly, it's more likely to develop checks, shakes, honeycomb, and other drying-related defects \u2022 Young wood is more likely to have \"reaction wood\" that bows or warps as you cut it.\n\n\n\u00a0 But I did notice that the 2x12s that we used for the steps and stringers were of a much higher quality. Because they were wider, there were necessarily cut from bigger, older trees. They weren't perfectly clear, but there were fewer knots and defects than in the 2x4 stock, and the knots tended to be tighter. So we bought some 2x10s* and ripped our 2x4 railings from them - it worked wonderfully. *Why not 2x12s where you can get three 2x4s out of each? Because you have to use the middle board, and most of the defects, especially the pith, are closer to the middle than the edges. Furthermore, the outside boards tend toward quartersawn and riftsawn grain, which is a good deal more stable than the plainsawn middle.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0As a bonus, the 2x10s were lumbered from Southern Yellow Pine (\u201cSYP\u201d on the stamp), a much stronger wood than the white wood 2x4s. If you want the numbers, the specific gravity of Ponderosa Pine (a common SPF) is just 0.38 on the average, compared to Southern Yellow Pine at 0.59, making SYP much denser and harder. Ponderosa Pine has a bending strength (modulus of rupture) of 1.29 Mpsi and a stiffness (modulus of elasticity) of 9,400 psi; while Southern Yellow Pine stands at 1.98 Mpsi and 14,500 psi respectively.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThere is an important consideration you should be aware of, especially if you plan to use any of these woods in woodworking projects. Construction lumber is typically kiln-dried to just 19% moisture content. You will want to get that down below 10% before you can rely on the stability of the wood. At 19%, it\u2019s still shrinking! This may mean air-drying the wood for 6 months to a year before you use it. \u201c",

I tell my kids there's always SOMETHING that could interest you in any of the books you see. My daughter loves animals and horses so she gravitates to those type of books.

Manga is in black-and-white and you read it backwards. And manga\u2019s popularity rose at the same time as the rise of video games and social media.

I think this has more to do with parents approach to reading (or lack thereof) and a consistent decline in funding school and public libraries. \n\nIt also seems like schools have a great difficulty teaching literature that connects with students.

I grew up loving books so much, and I genuinely believe I grew up a better person, and smarter, because I was exposed to so many sources of imagination, and learning, during my formative years.  Ninety percent of the content children absorb now is just brainrot content, and I fear it's going to get more concentrated as newer generations of parents who were exposed to that sort of content aren't going to encourage their children to read.

         "Not at all the same. TV and what you got on it was pretty much just passive entertainment. It had a singular purpose, and for the longest time, that was just fine. What we have today in just one device are MANY elements within it that are aggressively trying to hijack your brain in order to keep your eyes on them, and a great many of them are interactive, which makes them all the more exciting and extremely addictive. Sure, this affects adults too, but imagine the effects on a younger, developing brain. It's basically crack, and no book is going to stand a chance against it without some kind of external intervention.",
         "So, TV is designed to attract and maintain your attention, but through very different methods and with different abilities to track habits. The element of false socialization isn't as high with TV at all. The influencer economy is a huge part of why social media is more predatory towards kids than cable. Watching Nickelodeon and staying glued to the TV all day is not good for kids. But we don't have studies showing that it is causing as much lasting harm as the various apps and instant on demand gratification that a phone inflicts on people. The ability for your device to be with you everywhere is also a large component. Barely anything on the Internet is regulated, so the programming these kids get is on another level from what got on TV in terms of manipulation. And we all know that what got on TV wasn't very good in the first place. The ability to have interaction, even in small ways, is a game changer for getting people hooked.",

There\u2019s certainly a lot more emphasis being put on trying to make things addictive these days than there used to be.

         "You have a lot of replies but I'll still throw in my two cents. I was nearly held back for my development and then 2 years later was in the top of my class for English and reading (Texas has/had a graded reading program separate from English class)  \n\nManga comes in a variety of genres and targeted age, some series can be extremely wordy like hunterxhunter or death note while others focus on the art and the flow of action. A good place to start imo would be to first branch out from manga and see if they have any interest in manwha and manhua which should be an easy sell and would really broaden the number of cultures exposed too as well as genre options and of course options over all when it comes to teen vs adult stories. \n\nAll 3 of these are effectively the same medium, and culturally all 3 typically either start as light novels/webnovels or are later adapted into a light novel etc. In fact you are much more likely to find a \"comic\" form of the story cancelled early while the book form is continued or properly finished in most cases. Watching a show or a movie that is based on a previously read manga will highlight the differences and artistic choices made while telling the story and once a person understands that the book version is typically the most detailed and well thought out version it's all about personal taste. \n\nAs an example, I watched sword art online over a decade ago and like many was disappointed by the brevity of the first arc before the turn that the next 2 arcs went for. The manga was new and short and then I discovered the light novels were something like 8 or 9 books deep. So I chewed through those and ended up liking the series as a whole much more due to the overarching points the author was trying to make about Ai and \"artificial life\". The entire context of the story gets changed a bit by the intentional focus on things the anime itself downplays while also being much further along, something the anime took a decade to catch up on while everyone was being critical of the shows dressing while never discussing what the author is going for, which would also be a fair criticism of the books but the release schedule for the light novels was fairly short and complaints were limited to book by book discussions while the anime was broken up by arc and the manga made last of all. \n\nIt's fairly typical as well for a crappy manga with bad art to actually have a well written story underneath that gets cancelled due to popularity, or for the inverse of a beautifully drawn story covering for what is effectively a grade school level story. If you can broaden the options and introduce the novel forms of some of their favorite stories eventually they will develop preferences",

But it doesn't magically happen. Plenty of people go their whole lives just doing the bare minimum reading to get by school (not even that sometimes) and just never reading again when they get to the real world.\n\nAlso!

Just also keep trying with text only books.",

So, you need to view getting to \"real reading\" as a progression or ladder.  Start with the lightest stuff and work your way up.  \n\nAs for that specific jump from graphic novels to full chapter books, find a series that does both. Get them invested in the characters, world, etc, and let them make that jump. Added benefit of the rigor/text load is probably similar so they will still be accessible. \n\nAlso don't be above rewards for being a successful reader.  Kids respond to extrinsic motivators. Just try to avoid bribes.  The key here to differentiate between a reward and a bribe is rewards are proactive and your idea as the adult.  Bribes are reactive and generally a compromise.",

They did their best.\n\nI've read a graphic novel or two out of curiosity for this trend. I read Waltz with Bashir. And to American adolescents who have read this graphic novel, I'm sure it was a great cultural exchange and informative. Hopefully this led to a further explanation of this conflict.\n\nBut it really skims the topic of a complex issue.\n\nWe are at an intersection where too many people lack basic critical thinking skills. Media has become silo'd and too often digested in 60 second burst on social media. If Kids aren't \"forced\" to cultivate these skills in high school, I worry the window to acquire the skills to read and digest longer texts will be lost.\n\nKids at Ivy League schools are approaching professors telling them that are not able to read novels. I was reading Virginia Wolfe, Faulkner, Louise Erdrich, Chinua Achebe, Christopher Isherwood and EM Forster in college.\n\nThese novels touched on women's rights, racism, the Indigenous Genocide, Colonialism, the rise of an authoritarian state and Queer Culture.\n\nI went to a middling state school. These novels incited a curiosity. And coming from a White, working class background opened up radical new viewpoints that I continue to explore decades later.\n\nI think these kids are being coddled. And with the rise of the STEM fields, I am concerned that the Arts and Humanities will become a smaller part of the undergraduate experience. And in turn remove the opportunity to explore other views. Especially those different from the reader. This in turn allows for a celebration of diversity. And not the current trend with one party to outlaw teaching about slavery and other marginalized groups.\n\nThanks for your opinion. I offer mine with the greatest respect for yours.",

If it's only ten minutes, set a goal to read ten hard minutes every day until it feels easier, then bump it up by 5 minutes or so. \n\nEventually, you'll get to a point where you can read hard stuff for an hour at a time, and your textbooks will stop feeling so challenging.",

The funeral home may not have even known they were veterans of the Civil War - they just cremated the bodies and kept the cremains in storage. If the funeral home that handled the cremations had been acquired by another funeral home, which happens often, any knowledge of those cremains could have been lost in the process or just due to sheer time. \n\nNothing malicious, just sheer circumstance. \n\nAnyway, they have now been identified and can finally have their remains placed permanently instead of just sitting on a shelf.",

I even assisted a family in reclaiming the remains of a relative who passed over 20 years ago. They were cremated, but nobody claimed the decedents remains.

Just make it a memorial park for fishing and nature because nobody is going to go there for anything else otherwise. It was in a terrible location and new orleans east became a bit of a joke and a bad part of town even before the hurricane.

         "None of that will ever happen, unfortunately.\n\nNew Orleans East, which is where the park was located, has been suffering blight since the 1980s.  The city experienced a boom as a result of increased oil drilling activity in the area but since then, oil companies have been importing more oil since it's cheaper, and the whole area and population has been in decline.\n\nAt one point, the world's largest shopping mall was located in the area.  That shut down prior to Katrina.  The whole east New Orleans region is in decay.  It makes no sense to do any development out there that isn't industrial, and even then, it remains to be seen if the location is practical.  Plus Louisiana has a long history of enticing corporations to come to the state, then screwing them over.  Most recently they keep doing this with the film industry: one minute there's tax breaks, the next there isn't.   This often is the result of the alternation of republican and democratic governors.  When the republicans are in, they unleash fossil fuel industry restrictions and screw everybody else, including any deals previous administrations made with industries they deem \"un-friendly\" to the right.\n\nRight now, Louisiana has a governor that's more concerned with forcing schools to display the 10 commandments and taking children's scholarships away if they don't kneel for the national anthem, than they are in fostering a healthy business environment.\n\nThe reason the park failed is precisely because they decided to build an amusement park in an area that was in decline - they ignored all the market research.   And then they proceeded to design a park in the swamps that had virtually no shade.  It was dumb from the start.  The only brilliant move made was getting Six Flags to buy it.",

There was always routine talk of somebody re-opening it.\n\nThe problem was, all the proposals to do so were devoid of any substance.  Lots of press releases and plans, but no committment of the kind of money needed to really follow through.  (One of my favorites was local businessman Frank Scurlock's \"dream\" of building a huge Noah's Ark there - visible from the Interstate) and creating a Christian-themed family fun park.   Basically everybody jockey'd to get the properly from the city under the plan it would be re-opened and re-used, but what they really wanted was a sweet sale/lease for a large swath of land they could do something else with later.

It attracted 1.1 million visitors for its first season, but that decreased to 560 to 580 thousand the next season; Alfa filed for bankruptcy reorganization in February 2002.[20] Citing its benefit to the local economy, HUD loaned $25.3 million to build the park, and after Alfa went bankrupt, the city of New Orleans became liable for the remainder of the loan.[21] In 2001, the lease was put up for sale, and in March 2002 Six Flags purchased it for $22M,[21] although the park\u2019s name did not change that year. The New Orleans city council approved the 75-year lease in August 2002; under the negotiated agreement, repayment of the remaining $24.4 million loan from HUD was to be split between the park ($1.4M/year) and the city ($1M/yr).  \n\nReference [Six Flags New Orleans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Flags_New_Orleans)",

The reason the A320 broke into the market was the gap left by the end of production of the MD-80 family, the Fokkers, and the 727. Lots of airlines had a gap and chose the A320 as the 737 was a bit behind before the 737NG was flying.\n\nThe A330 and 787 compete directly. If you have old 767s, you are going to choose one of those, whichever makes the most sense for your route network.\n\nThe A350 kinda competes with the 777, but also doesn't at the same time. The 777 is bigger by a significant margin, and whenever the X actually finishes certification, will be more efficient. But the A350 has RANGE going for it, incredible range.\n\nAirbus has the Bombardier C Series (A220) in a segment that Boeing does not compete in. Likewise, Boeing offers a super heavy freighter in the 777F, and even when the A350F comes out, it will still have a smaller payload capacity.\n\nOffering wise, both companies have very competitive lineups.

He still has the legal shit storm of paying people to vote/register, and he still has to deal with any new legal issues that his admission in court will now cause.  \n   \nHe got a short term win here 100%.

If they had insufficient evidence to convict the individual then the proper course is to drop the case. It isn't to try to get some level of 'justice' anyways. That isn't justice. That is why I take issue as I said with this kind of deal. If they felt strongly about their case then a deal like this is insufficient. If they felt their case was weak enough that this deal was appropriate then they should be dropping the case instead. It is insufficient in either way.",

I understand it was Sheila's hair, the whole point is that her hair was in a place it reasonably should be and there seemingly was not anything that tied the vehicle to the murder. In fact it seems to be the opposite that there is testimony that excludes the vehicle from being the one used by the murderer. If there was additional evidence that linked the car to the murder then that would certainly help, though it doesn't really change the fact that it is not unusual for her hair to be in the car.",

That\u2019s not a bad price, with conversion it\u2019s about the same as kids meals cost in the UK. A lot of kids get free school meals though if they are low income families. It\u2019s good breakfast is free for yours.",
         "Or in this case, paid for by the school.",
         "There is no free lunch. If there's no fee for everyone, then it really comes from taxes and we have a progressive tax system where higher incomes pay more so in effect they're still subsidizing it, just indirectly.\n\nMy opinion is that free food in school for kids is well worth extra taxes and probably pays for itself in the long run.",

         "I'm really just annoyed there's an arbitrary limit. The price is fine, and as far as I know offering free/reduced costs for low-income families is standard in the US. I'm shocked breakfast has remained free, as it only came about during the pandemic and this area is very conservative. They keep saying it will end and somehow it persists.",

         "Not the person you've been replying to, but I deal with the same.is a $3.25 fee regardless how much I pay, but the max is $100. I can and do just put in $100 each time either kid gets low, but I'd rather put $350 each in in August and not have to think about it again until May or even the following August.\n\nBut I'm fully aware that I'm blessed to have the savings to do that without hardship.",
         "I literally cannot have children due to my lack of vas deferens so that isn't an issue for me. School lunches should be free anyway.",
         "I\u2019m all for free lunch if it\u2019s free for EVERYONE. Well off people shouldn\u2019t have to pay for their own lunch while still paying taxes to give it to others for free. Equity dictates that everyone should get it for free. The only fair way.",
         "Not when the government is picking up the tab!",
         "It sucks there\u2019s a limit. I\u2019m glad they are stopping the transaction fees. It should be for all families though, not just low income ones.",
         "True. But if you get paid monthly and have to pay a months worth of meals anyway, it makes sense to put it all on in one go doesnt it?",
         "Yes, I get what you mean. Not everyone can do that, or even put 100 on at a time. It\u2019s shit that they\u2019ve put limits on, Nevermind the transaction fees everytime. For all the families that can only put enough on per week it\u2019s like paying for an extra meal, it\u2019s not fair for people that are struggling. I bet with the COL crisis it\u2019s not just low income families struggling either.",
         "Sorry to hear that. My wife and I never did because she had cancerous tumors in her uterus.\u00a0\n\nWhile I agree that school lunches should be free, I think this ban doesn\u2019t hit the right party. Most school systems struggle. This is just adding to their plate. Would have liked them to say the bank should eat any fees, not the school.\u00a0",

         "The reason they are saying it wasn't a lottery has to do with the requirements around sweepstakes versus a contest. Essentially the one they want to avoid is a sweepstakes/lottery, where there is random selection. Where random selection occurs there is more rigorous requirements from laws, such as alternative methods of entry. A contest on the other hand can have other rules, including the organization selecting the winners with intention. The difference between the two is nuanced, but essentially they are trying to argue this was a contest not a sweepstakes or lottery. Contests allow for it to be a qualified marketing expense to giveaway money, so long as there is not an equal chance of winning for every entrant. [https://nationalsweepstakescompany.com/blog/sweepstakes-vs-contest/](https://nationalsweepstakescompany.com/blog/sweepstakes-vs-contest/)\n\n  \nThe thing I don't think they did though was layout the requirements of how winners would be selected in advance. So they may still run afoul of the rules around contests. The thing is here though there are two sets of laws, one is around election interference, and then around sweepstakes/contests. I would argue that they have violated both, but election laws may carry more than civil penalties and fines. I would imagine the lawyer wants to keep this as close to a marketing campaign for Trump, and them just not following all of the rules they should have and end up paying a fine. The reality I hope for is there are some actual criminal charges, but we will have to wait and see.",

I wasn\u2019t trying to argue or anything.\n\nI agree, I don\u2019t see many sanctions either, especially under trump.\n\nI hate it too, we should absolutely have been there the minute Putin tried, but that\u2019s just my opinion.\n\nI can understand that the us should prioritize its own people and all, but it leaves a very bad taste in my mouth that we promised Ukraine we\u2019d be there if this happened.\n\nAnd we just aren\u2019t now."
