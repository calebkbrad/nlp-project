         "As an NCer I'm relieved. Even if we get a psycho Trump presidency, a Democratic governor at least offers one layer of protection.\n\nWith that said, I truly hope that NC (and the country) go blue as well. NC is a state that often splits the ballot so this win doesn't mean NC for Harris is a sure thing.",

         "This likely doesn\u2019t mean much for Harris.  For starters, NC has a very long history of having a moderate Democrat governor while going red for President.  \n\nAlso, that Robinson guy was so catastrophically bad as a candidate that polls were showing him losing by like 15-20 points.  If he was only moderately bad he might have driven Democratic turnout to defeat him\u2026..but it\u2019s been obvious for weeks he was going to lose like 55% - 40%.  And Stein is pretty moderate.  \n\nDoubt it means anything for Harris.",
         "So, will Robinson concede at some point?",
         "I'm just happy that a Nazi didn't win in NC.",
         "I don\u2019t know how the presidential race is going to go, but I live in North Carolina and I\u2019m glad Stein won at the very least.",

         "I'm so glad Stein beat Robinson. Robinson was a deeply messed up and concerning candidate, and here's to hoping this is a sign Harris has strength to win the state too",
         "Wow I'm shocked /s\n\nCongrats to Stein, now I'm just waiting to see the margins because one pollster put it at +18 before election night",
         "Hopefully this means Robinson depressed the vote for Trump too",

         "The Fairness Doctrine was basically useless. All they did to honor it was bringing a punching bag to act as R or D depending on the angle of attack. It wasn't doing the job intended for it, and it was restricted to cable news only. \n\nThe opinion talkshows that is all the rage these days wouldn't need to bother with the Fairness Doctrine anyways. \n\nBut I definitely agree that some kind of ethical standard should be codified to enforce more neutrality in media reporting, but it would be difficult to account for social media reporting. Which is a worringly large percentage of where the people get their news from these days. Tiktok, Whatsapp and Facebook are the biggest news sources for way too many people."

She also had a better ground game in the great lakes than Clinton did and Harris ramped it up in a short period of time.  Hubris was a big part of that downfall.  I hate relitigating all of this because that whole thing was so frustrating.  There's no world where a candidate like Trump should've had a chance in hell in '16.",
         "To be fair, \"not Trump\" should be way more than enough. I get we didn't understand just how much more than enough back then, but still.",
         "That's crazy because I think AOC and Bernie are pretty similar in beliefs and policy. I'd think they hate them both and prefer a more centrist D party.",

         "Agreed. As a foreigner I don't hesitate to name Bernie Sanders in the same breath as the likes of Franklin D. Roosevelt or Abraham Lincoln when it comes to impressive/great American leaders/politicians. Yes, he's not as influental as the other examples, but as you said, that's also due to the platform he's campaigning on (social democracy, in America viewed as socialism). Despite cancer like Fox News poisoning American democracy for decades now he still manages to steer the US in a more civilised direction.\n\nUnfortunately he's really old now (still perfectly sharp, but things often happen rapidly in your 80s). Fortunately though, his influence managed to make young prodigies like AOC more palatable to your people.",

         "Why was it misogynistic? \n\n>Why would I choose that over the potential first female president? \n\nthat mattered more to you than the actual substance? \n\nIt is also important to note that Hillarys campaign broke campaign financing rules, got unfair advantages such as questions ahead of time, delved in personal attacks (including looks) while Bernie never personally attacked her. \n\nWould be curious to know if those mattered to you?",
         "They mean it was one of the reasons he won rather than being just another crazy candidate. The DNC\u2019s treatment of Bernie pissed off a lot of the left and alienated some to the point that they didn\u2019t vote or voted for Stein",
         "No, the media giving him billions of dollars in free advertisement compared to every other republican candidate in that primary, and the democratic primary in general. He got something like 80% of the coverage instead of him just being ignored like he should have been. One of the channels changed from Bernie giving a speech to switch to Trump's rally showing an empty fuckin podium.",

Every other candidate (other than Warren) and the entire party, prompted by the donors, had to then rally around Biden explicitly in an effort to stop Bernie. Not only did they lean on the scale in 2016, in 2020 the entire party mobilized to stop him getting the nomination. These are just facts.",
         "Bro what? Iowa isn't everything, after Bernie won New Hampshire and especially Nevada, many mainstream media outlets were saying he was the frontrunner with the most momentum.

But he always wanted to use a stack that *could not possibly work* in that day and age, and would have been a total rewrite of basically everything.  Does this sound a little familiar?\n\nSo he effectively staged a coup within PayPal while someone was on their honeymoon.  He started *forcing* his changes.  Does this sound a little familiar?\n\nHe got kicked out of the company.  He was effectively given a \"fuck off fee\".  They wanted him gone so badly *they paid him to leave*.\n\nHe is still trying, nearly 30 years later, to prove that he was right all along.  He needs to prove that they were the dumb ones, that he was the smart one.

Must required that people signing the petition be registered voters. That is by definition an incentive because the voter was the one who had to take action to register and then sign the petition. Random pollsters calling from a list of people to pay for surveys being filled out provides no such incentive.

Looking at the data on google they use historical data to pre determine the results of a state online. If only 40% precincts have reported for a state how do they know a states results with certainty?\n\nI can see this with a number of reporting precincts correlating with the number of remaining voters becoming a mathematical impossibility for the vote to swing back to another candidate.  But then when I checked Mississippi on the map on google it had 4% of precincts reporting but had already given the state to trump? \n\nI\u2019m just asking because I feel like this is part of why people think a states vote was defrauded. Like we\u2019re getting ahead of ourselves a bit before all the results are in.

         "Rogan has always had the problem where his opinions and thoughts are only relevant to the most recent guest on his podcast, in the last week, he said three of the most outspoken conservative personalities on his podcast, it\u2019s no wonder the only thing he can see/understand is the conservative viewpoint. \n\nIt\u2019s always been a problem with Joe Rogan. He just doesn\u2019t seem to be able to think critically enough to form his own opinions. Based on the information he\u2019s given however he merely co-ops the opinions of the people he\u2019s spoken to.  \n\nIt\u2019s honestly been pretty sad to watch, his turn from the beginning of Covid to now is complete with his endorsement of Donald Trump. \n\nPretty embarrassing .",

He let Trump off the hook like a baby. He asked Trump if he will ever present evidence to back his election fraud claims. Trump says, \"uhh\", then changes the topic to Hunters laptop.

Rogan doesn't care about anyone or anything other than his own personal best interests. \n\n  \nRogan doesn't care if children starve in school, if women die while being denied access to healthcare, and if he doesn't care how many trans kids commit suicide as long as his taxes go down.",

         "\u201cWell, he fucked up there.\u201d",
         "Honestly, Rogan is not enjoyable anymore to watch. It's just too fake these days. Every new pod he magically changes he's opinions to those of he's guest. The conversation doesn't feel genuine anymore.\n\nHe's starting to feel like my barber, who is a nice guy and all but he somehow always fills the time with a lot of talking without saying anything.",

I have a friend and my friend\u2019s wife is a school teacher. And she told him that there was discussions in the school that the mother wanted to put a litter box in a school.\u201d That would be a bit different from actually installing a litter box in the girl\u2019s room as Rogan had said in the previous broadcast. Rogan then mentioned how he and his friend\u2019s wife had made some more inquiries and concluded, \u201cI don\u2019t think they actually did it.\u201d Rogan went on to say, \u201cI think there were discussions about doing it because there was one particularly wacky mother. It doesn\u2019t seem like there was any proof that they actually put the litter box in there.\u201d\n\nLitteral BS, in both cases. \nThere were no \"discussions about doing it because there was one particularly wacky mother.\" \nSo, never believe a word this guy says.",

But it totally reminded me of those charts that came out a couple years back about how republican voters basically have flip flopped on drone strikes depending on who was in office and democrats mostly stayed the same.\n\n\nA lot of \"enlightend centralist\" will claim that they think both sides are treating it as team sports, but honestly I only see one side talk about policy and actionable items and reaching across the aisle and another side spewing hateful horseshit team rhetoric",

There is a chance that they tried to do that and the democrats were already aware of the who did what but would still be interesting to see the comparison.\n\nAs a leftist, I would also be interested in a video like that.

Republicans have actually been pushing early voting more this time in places, and Trump hasn't been *actively pushing against it*, so it makes sense for less Republicans to be 100% insistent on showing up on E-Day.\n\nI dunno why you got downvoted, maybe it was the tone?

And he's only gotten worse since then.\n\n\n2) Hillary was by FAR the most unimpressive candidate I've ever seen, 2nd only to John Kerry in 2004. Had massive amounts of baggage, a complacent campaign that wasted time trying to run up the score and failed on fundamentals, and had the Comey October Surprise of reopening the \"buttery males\" thing days before the election (which then ended up as a nothingburger).\n\nIt's been attested that Hillary was the only candidate that Trump could beat, and I firmly agree with that sentiment.\n\n\nMy vibe-check is it's somewhere between 2008 and 2020. I've gone through some DEEP RED Trump areas recently, and the enthusiasm just... isn't there. There would have been signs on every house in 2016, but now they're about 50/50 with Harris signs.

         "Both of your factors are debatable. One of the recent themes of Trump's rallies has been \"are you better off now or four years ago,\" and republicans think of the time before the pandemic when he says that. Obviously the economic situation the pandemic left the world in is not Biden's fault, but uneducated voters think it is. \n\nKamala doesn't have the Clinton name as baggage, but she does have Biden's presidency weighing her down. Biden has surrounded himself with competent people and done a good job as President, but he has a low approval rating with many voters blaming his administration on immigration and the economy (both hot issues). Also Hilary had the super-delegate controversy and Kamala wasn't primaried, and both are female candidates running against Trump.

About three-quarters (73%) say the national economy is in not so good or poor shape, surpassing the 67% who say so nationally.",

And a lot less people are buying full albums; that coherence isn't expected or even wanted. I've been trying to push my own band toward this model. I LOVE albums, and I love when our efforts make coherence. But the length of time our albums take to make doesn't lend itself to that level of coherence anymore.

Are you the biggest loser, Donald? I talked to all the historians at the Wharton School and at MIT and they\u2019ve never seen anything like it. No one has ever tried to steal three elections in a row. At least George W. Bush was able to actually win one. \n\nDonald, are you a bigger loser than George W. Bush?\n\nYou lost your first election by three million votes. Americans don\u2019t like you, Donald. \n\nThen you lost your second election by 10 million votes. You always say you got more votes than any sitting president ever, and yet\u2026 you still lost by 10 million votes. That\u2019s how much people don\u2019t like you.\n\nDonald, you can do math can\u2019t you? In 2020, seven million people liked Joe Biden more than you! Another 3 million, given the choice between Biden and You, chose ANYONE ELSE. That\u2019s 84 million Americans, Donald, who voted against you. 84 Million! No sitting President has ever had that many people vote against him, Donald. No one.\n\nJust you. \n\nLet me put it another way for you, Don. In 2016, there were 65 million people who voted against you. Four years later, it was 84 million people! That\u2019s 19 million more people the second time! They weren\u2019t illegal, Donald. They weren\u2019t \u201cmade up\u201d votes. It wasn\u2019t \u201cvoter fraud.\u201d It was non-voters!

So, I\u2019m guessing that the outcome is going to be way off from what most of the polling was telling us about his supporters.

It's so much more blatantly misogynistic, xenophobic, angry and racist. \n\nI just can't believe he has grown support among anyone outside of *maybe* white men, which won't be enough.\n\nHarris' campaign on the other hand has been nearly flawless on messaging and has been much stronger than Biden's across all demographics in 2020. If she increases turnout we might see a blowout. Worse case if she matches Biden's, it will be a slim victory.\n\nLike I feel like he's more than likely *lost* support, especially women who may vote behind closed doors.

It was going to be literally everything his followers fantasized about - and more!\n\nThen Biden won the election. But of course that was just a ruse to lure all of the democrats to DC where a secret military force loyal to Trump (who actually won) would arrest them and try them all in military courts. There were going to be mass executions and everything. Then the inauguration happened and there was no mass arrest and Biden was sworn in as president. So the date was moved further into the future and soon Trump would reveal himself as the real president. But that date came and went as well. And another date. And another one. There were predictions about all of the various court cases contesting the election results, and all of them fell flat. People were finally starting to get tired of the constant stream of predictions being wrong and it was getting harder and harder for them to just say \"Trust the plan\" when literally nothing was going their way. I think the final nail in the coffin was when Q jumped the shark and predicted JFK Jr was going to come back from the dead and reveal himself as a Trump supporter and Trump's new Vice President. Most of the remaining Q supporters gave up at this point, and the few who didn't were thoroughly mocked by the media when they actually showed up in Dallas waiting for the big reveal.\n\nI honestly don't know if Q kept making predictions after this point because that was effectively the end of anyone caring or talking about it.

         "Provide proof of the claim that you allege they are blind to. \n\nHere's a friendly reminder of how Trump's election fraud cases went for him last time around...  \n\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trumps-challenges-2020-election-unfolded-courtroom-rcna175490\n\n> After Donald Trump claimed victory in the early-morning hours after election night in 2020, his campaign and supporters turned to the courts to make that claim a reality. The Trump campaign and surrogates began filing lawsuits the very same day, challenging the results on a variety of grounds well before the final votes were counted.\n> \n> The legal process and tactics may provide insight into how Trump or his allies could launch similar efforts should he lose again this time.\n> \n> Over the remainder of November and into December, Trump and his Republican allies filed dozens of lawsuits in key swing states that, if successful, would have given Trump the Electoral College votes needed to remain in the White House. Their efforts stretched from local county courts all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court and were supported by solo practitioners and state attorneys general alike.\n> \n> Of the more than 60 lawsuits filed in the post-election period, Trump obtained a favorable ruling in only one case \u2014 the remainder were eventually either dismissed, settled or voluntarily withdrawn.  \n\nNot to mention how poorly it went for his attorneys...  \n\nhttps://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/trump-lawyer-cases-show-2020-election-punishments-come-slowly \n \n> Here\u2019s a rundown of some of the most notable cases state lawyer organizations and courts are pursuing:  \n> \n> **Jeffrey Clark**\n> \n> A DC Bar committee on April 4 preliminarily found Clark violated at least one ethics rule by lying about alleged election fraud. The panel will decide as early as next month before sending the matter to the Board on Professional Responsibility. The case then goes to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.\n> \n> The bar\u2019s DC disciplinary counsel, Hamilton \u201cPhil\u201d Fox, is seeking Clark\u2019s disbarment. The bar bodies and the appeals court could decide on lesser sanctions, such as a written warning.  \n> \n> **John Eastman**\n> \n> A California State Bar Court judge on March 27 said Eastman should be disbarred for knowingly making false statements that election irregularities cost Trump the 2020 race.\n> \n> The bar court\u2019s appellate division will review the finding, and the state\u2019s highest court will ultimately decide. Eastman has said he could seek US Supreme Court review.\n> \n> Though Eastman has yet to be disbarred, he is ineligible to practice law in California, according to his online law license. Eastman challenged his \u201cinactive\u201d law license status on April 3. The State Bar argued on April 10 that Eastman needs to be sidelined because he has shown he is willing \u201cto misrepresent facts, violate the law, and pursue frivolous claims on behalf of clients.\u201d  \n> \n> **Rudy Giuliani**\n> \n> New York\u2019s Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in June 2021 temporarily suspended Giuliani\u2019s law license for making false, misleading statements about the election. A Democratic state senator had filed a complaint with the state\u2019s Attorney Grievance Committee, which sought the suspension.\n> \n> The District of Columbia Court of Appeals followed, temporarily suspending Giuliani\u2019s license in July 2021.\n> \n> A DC Bar committee in July 2023 recommended Guliani\u2019s disbarment for his failed election challenge in Pennsylvania. The bar\u2019s Board on Professional Responsibility held a hearing in November. The board\u2019s report could be issued at any time.\n> \n> After the board makes its finding, the case goes to the DC Court of Appeals.  \n> \n> **Sidney Powell**\n> \n> The Michigan Attorney Grievance Commission in May 2023 filed a complaint claiming Powell and other lawyers brought frivolous election challenges in the state. A hearing panel of the Michigan Attorney Discipline Board in December rejected Powell\u2019s arguments that the board lacks jurisdiction.\n> \n> In 2021, a US district judge in Detroit fined Powell and other attorneys more than $175,000 in 2021 for wasting resources by filing a lawsuit to overturn the election result in Michigan. The US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit largely upheld the sanctions in 2023, and the US Supreme Court in February declined to hear a challenge of the appeals court decision.\n> \n> In Texas, the Texas Commission for Lawyer Discipline last year said it is taking its ethics case against Powell to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth District of Texas. A federal judge in Texas in February 2023 threw out discipline charges that alleged Powell had violated legal ethics rules. \n> \n> **Jenna Ellis**\n> \n> In March 2023, a Colorado judge censured Ellis, who once said she was part of an \u201celite strike force\u201d fighting for Trump. The judge declined to disbar Ellis for her role in making 10 false claims about the 2020 election. \n> \n> **Kenneth Chesebro**\n> \n> The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court as of March 13 temporarily suspended the law license of Chesebro, an architect, along with Eastman, of a plan to create elector slates in six states. Chesebro is also unable to practice law in California, at least on an interim basis, according to his state bar online record.  \n> \n> **Julia Haller, Brandon Johnson, Lawrence Joseph**\n> \n> In DC, The bar\u2019s disciplinary counsel, Fox, on Jan. 9 filed claims against Haller, Johnson and Joseph.\n> \n> He alleged that Haller and Johnson filed suits against election offices and officials in Michigan, Georgia, Wisconsin and Arizona seeking to overturn the election results. Fox claimed that Joseph, in a suit he filed in Texas against former Vice President Mike Pence, made claims about a \u201ccompeting slate\u201d of electors in Arizona that \u201chad no factual basis.\u201d",

He mocked Biden for being old and mentally infirm, and he repeatedly mispronounced Harris\u2019s name and insulted her intelligence. At times, he echoed rhetoric from Nazi Germany and, more recently, falsely declared himself \u201cthe father of IVF\u201d and promised to protect women, \u201cwhether the women like it or not.\u201d\n\n> A week ago Sunday, at what was supposed to be his triumphant Madison Square Garden rally in a city that had never fully accepted him, Trump\u2019s speech was overshadowed by a comedian who appeared before him and described Puerto Rico as \u201ca floating island of garbage.\u201d Trump was livid, saying the comment \u2014 and ensuing days of negative headlines \u2014 was an unforced error in the final days, two people close to him said.\n\n> Yet for much of the campaign, Trump offered a message of xenophobia and misogyny and racism, of cruelty and darkness and hate. If he wins, it will be because enough of the nation embraced that message, too. And if he loses, it will be because enough of the nation voted against that message \u2014 and Trump himself.\n\nexcerpted from (possibly  paywalled) article: \n\n[In the final stretch before Election Day, Trump \u2014 to the chagrin of many aides and allies \u2014 has seemed unable to curb his worst impulses.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/11/05/trump-final-days-2024-campaign/?utm_campaign=wp_the7&utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&carta-url=https%3A%2F%2Fs2.washingtonpost.com%2Fcar-ln-tr%2F3f88b4c%2F672a079009757d7432beb443%2F60d1f4309bbc0f32a3467c8e%2F29%2F107%2F672a079009757d7432beb443)",

He's insulted and threatened people, public and private. He's disgraced himself, which has become all too normal and accepted for his campaigns. \n\nWorst in history. Yes. Somehow trumping his own ugly, deranged performances in the past. \n\nBut you're giving her a little too much credit. Kamala has applied herself competently. She's avoided gaffes. She's pulled together policy agendas in relatively short time in reaction to being handed the baton mid-season. All that is commendable.\n\nHowever, that's not the best campaign in history. You're getting carried away. \n\nObama was quite a bit more effective at winning hearts and minds. He didn't have the benefit of his opponent being the most repugnant human being on earth. He hadn't been VP for 4 years. He was the underdog and rose meteorically because of his rhetorical skill, his agreeable, common sense and sensible persona, and a massively innovative campaign leveraging the internet (during the onset of Web 2.0 days) in unprecedented ways, basically writing a new playbook for every political campaign of the following 18 years. His team combined data science and grassroots mobilization and globally recognizable branding to get our first African American president elected. He was a fucking rock star.\n\nKamala hasn't come anywhere close to that. She's borrowed some of those moves, which have been refined over almost 2 decades, and she's wisely followed his lead in approaching controversial issues with caution and consideration. But she has barely broken through all the noise Trump creates. She's going to be a great President (assuming the country doesn't fuck this up) but she's largely being propelled by people's hatred of Trump because even though she has made the effort to explain what she stands for, most people don't feel like they've heard her.

The President is likely closer and with split ballots so it will take a little longer.",
         "It\u2019s still early, but he seems to have a decisive lead so far. It\u2019s only 11% of the vote in as I write this. \n\nBut Fox News themselves projected yesterday that Robinson was going to lose. Their internal polling for him must be abysmal, so they just came out and called it early because his odds are so slim.",
         "Because Stein has an overwhelming number of votes already. Not so much for POTUS.",
         "N.C. normally chooses a Democratic governor, yet go red MOST of the time for president. But it\u2019s extremely close so it\u2019s too early to call for who wins in that state.",

         "Like Ohio. As of right now Trump is leading for President but Senator Brown (Democratic incumbent) is leading the Senate race.",
         "Yeah, I\u2019m fearing it will be like with Hillary. White women voted against her too. A woman of color has way less of a chance then. The thing is everyone knows who Trump is now and he\u2019s worse than he was before. Did people flip from Biden away from Harris? What in the world do people actually think Trump is going to do for them or this county?",
         "If you think Mark Robinson is reprehensible but Trump is not, you're mentally ill.\n\n(Not you specifically)",

         "Especially this year, where that possibility has been a major theory.",
         "Almost consistently so. Stein was polling well ahead of Harris here, and early reporting, was about 7% higher than her, unfortunately.",
         "This is the answer. If there are 10 voters. You count 6 votes and they are all for Person 1, then you can call the election for that person, because even if the remaining 4 votes go to Person 2 he'd still lose. But officially, the race is not over because we have not counted all the votes.",
         "We had Pat the Rat and his bathroom bill lost us the ACC tournament and millions in money from all the touring acts that avoided NC because of it",

         "That's pretty much a textbook dictator flaw:\n\n>His government was constantly in chaos, with officials having no idea what he wanted them to do, and nobody was entirely clear who was actually in charge of what. He procrastinated wildly when asked to make difficult decisions, and would often end up relying on gut feeling, leaving even close allies in the dark about his plans. His \"unreliability had those who worked with him pulling out their hair,\" as his confidant Ernst Hanfstaengl later wrote in his memoir Zwischen Wei\u00dfem und Braunem Haus. This meant that rather than carrying out the duties of state, they spent most of their time in-fighting and back-stabbing each other in an attempt to either win his approval or avoid his attention altogether, depending on what mood he was in that day.\n\n>There's a bit of an argument among historians about whether this was a deliberate ploy on Hitler's part to get his own way, or whether he was just really, really bad at being in charge of stuff. Dietrich himself came down on the side of it being a cunning tactic to sow division and chaos\u2014and it's undeniable that he was very effective at that. But when you look at Hitler's personal habits, it's hard to shake the feeling that it was just a natural result of putting a workshy narcissist in charge of a country.\n\n>**Hitler was incredibly lazy. According to his aide Fritz Wiedemann, even when he was in Berlin he wouldn't get out of bed until after 11 a.m., and wouldn't do much before lunch other than read what the newspapers had to say about him, the press cuttings being dutifully delivered to him by Dietrich.**\n\n>He was obsessed with the media and celebrity, and often seems to have viewed himself through that lens. He once described himself as \"the greatest actor in Europe,\" and wrote to a friend, \"I believe my life is the greatest novel in world history.\" In many of his personal habits he came across as strange or even childish\u2014he would have regular naps during the day, he would bite his fingernails at the dinner table, and he had a remarkably sweet tooth that led him to eat \"prodigious amounts of cake\" and \"put so many lumps of sugar in his cup that there was hardly any room for the tea.\"\n\n>He was deeply insecure about his own lack of knowledge, preferring to either ignore information that contradicted his preconceptions, or to lash out at the expertise of others. He hated being laughed at, but enjoyed it when other people were the butt of the joke (he would perform mocking impressions of people he disliked). But he also craved the approval of those he disdained, and his mood would quickly improve if a newspaper wrote something complimentary about him.\n\n>Little of this was especially secret or unknown at the time. It's why so many people failed to take Hitler seriously until it was too late, dismissing him as merely a \"half-mad rascal\" or a \"man with a beery vocal organ.\" In a sense, they weren't wrong. In another, much more important sense, they were as wrong as it's possible to get.\n\n>Hitler's personal failings didn't stop him having an uncanny instinct for political rhetoric that would gain mass appeal, and it turns out you don't actually need to have a particularly competent or functional government to do terrible things.",

He will never understand it because he doesn't understand self sacrifice for the greater good.

To Cruz' defense, he's very used to that.\n\nOnce that failed, and Trump remained, they FOR SOME REASON, let DeSantis run against him.

         "How many friends did you lose, Vance? Okay, good.",
         "You sold your soul to someone you called \"America's Hitler\" and you expected there to be no consequences?\n\nYou can't shake the devil's hand then say you were only kidding.",
         "Both from the same article,\n\nVance: \"We oughta be kind to one another, we oughta treat each other with respect.\"\n\nAlso Vance: \"we are going to take out the trash in Washington, D.C., and the trash\u2019s name is Kamala Harris.\"\n\nSo forgive my inability to see his morality hiding behind his hypocrisy.",

         "Good",
         "It's amazing how they hide behind \"politics\" as the reason their friends have shut them out. \n\nLike, suddenly they want to make the argument about policy, when they absolutely know that the argument is about basic decency and character.\n\nVance knows very well that he's plumping up one of the most despicable men in America. A thug. A resentful, thieving asshole. A man who thinks nothing of assaulting women or lying about those assaults.\n\nThis isn't about politics, and we all know it.",
         "Maybe because he sold himself out. This is the same man that called Trump disgrace and American Hitler. Keep in mind he has mixed children which Trump insulted Mixed community. \nHe willing to sell himself out including his own family if it means getting his hands on Presidential office because he knows Trump isn't all there anymore, he on mental decline. Giving him power to do his buddies agenda national wide.",

         "Wow.\n\n\n\nHe had friends?",
         "I had a friend who used to hate Nazis and then turned into a Nazi himself, just like Vance did. It should be no surprise that you lose friends when you are anti Hitler, then start siding with Hitler.",
         "Sorry.... but I cannot even be around Trump supporters.  \n\nOne told me she thought Kamala was a communist because her father was a professor who taught communism.\n\nThat is a level of stupidity I cannot tolerate.\n\nAnd I am tired of people believing every conspiracy theory about a black and Indian woman and denying every fact about an orange piece of shit.",

         "Good!",
         "Good is right. Trump supporters should be isolated and shunned from the public. This trash have proven they cannot think or function in a rational society.

Just be nice and don't end friendships with your swastika flag waving neighbors, you silly gooses...Okay.\"\n\nYou're damn right I've severed ties with friends and acquaintances due to their support of the orange dipshit. Either they are too dumb for me to be able to rely on as a friend, or now that I've seen their true colors, are no longer people I want around me. I saw a X post somewhere, probably on Reddit where it said something along the lines of, \"I now consider supporting Trump as a character flaw.\" and I agree. \n\nGood luck everyone, be safe today as you vote, and tomorrow as you wake up to the chaos he's going to cause either way.",

         "Good. Sounds like he used to know people with character and good judgment.\n\nI'll add this onto the pile: Sales of his book are going to crater. He had a bestseller get turned into a movie with a star-studded cast, and I bet his residuals are about to go from a comfortable passive income to a rounding error after this election cycle. The value of Hillbilly Elegy in publishers' back catalog plummeted every day he doubled down on putting his name next to Trump's.",

         "What's the end goal of all of this \"You can't end a friendship over politics!\" rhetoric anyways? Is there going to be a mandatory minimum for everyone in the country to befriend at least one conservative person and stay friends even if said person keeps texting them 4chan conspiracy theories?\n\nLike, don't be a shitheel if you want to be friends with other people who aren't also shitheels.

Took polling a while to spot the cannibalization as it's a behavioral pattern shift.\n\nWe'll see.

It was pretty much the only good source of national news available to us (the Internet was shall we say, not great or widely available, and cable was only available if you lived fairly close to the main street in town, otherwise to get anything other than over the air broadcast, you were looking at DirecTV or Dish).\u00a0",

Anyone who cares about journalistic integrity at any of them is being increasingly sidelined. They're going to be posting what people want to click on, and the strategy is usually either to cast a wide net or just cast multiple nets saying different (sometimes directly opposed) things.

         "It\u2019d be fascinating to see the evolution of polling techniques over the last 25 years.  My hunch (speculation) is that current polling involves a lot less direct communication with voters and a lot more screen time and juggling of questionable data and assumptions.",
         "Nate Silver also commented that even in a truly tied race, you would only expect around 68% of polls with regular sample sizes to be in the +-3 points range for either Harris or Trump, but he observed that well over 80% of polls is within that range. So it is practically guaranteed that they are moving the outcomes closer to 50/50 than what they observe. But the fact that after Selzer they dare to show some positive results for Harris also says little, maybe more Trump-positive results remain hidden. Best to assume we really don't know what polling says at the moment.",

         "I suspect what we're seeing most of all is the mass-gamification of polling, forecasts, and betting markets.\n\nPrior to 2008, polls and forecasts weren't a part of the popular consciousness. They were for political wonks and nerds and a handful of journalists.\n\nThen ol' Nate Silver comes 'round and grabs a pot and dumps some polls and some statistics in to it and sprinkles in some pretty graphs for flavor and it *takes off*, because internet nerds have some pretty clickies to browse all day long in the lead-up to the election and reading the stuff he puts together makes them feel smart.\n\n2012 is still mostly Nate Silver's game but now randos are starting to talk about it too and big publications like New York TImes wants a piece of the action.\n\nBy 2016, there are now multiple competitors and forecasts have become *part of the political process*. 2016 does 2016 things of course and a few dozen bloggers get a tidal wave of clicks by writing up \"what went wrong in 2016\" articles, but the one thing that *doesn't* happen is people stop following polls and forecasts. A few nerds, like me, have the massively unpopular opinion that, maybe, these forecasts are actually a bit harmful to the political process, but the slobbering masses are too desperate to know what's gonna happen before it happens to hear it.\n\nBy 2020, polls, forecasts, and betting markets have become fully gamified, and now in 2024 we're experiencing it like people are suddenly experiencing climate change for the first time. Everyone's confused, everyone's like, \"wait, why is this all so weird this year?\".\n\nIn like 80% of discussions about the US presidential election over the last three months especially you'll find *someone* saying something along the lines of, \"welp, guess I better make a wager over on (a betting market)\". People are discussing *the names and reputations of pollsters and forecasters now*, and *that* behavior is indistinguishable from everybody in suburbia buying an investment property in 2007.\n\nNow we're cheering on individual polls like they're the same team sports as political races.\n\nAnd so yeah, when things get gamified, game theory rolls up to make everything go sideways and upside-down. Hooray.",

Remember that trump played the access game. Aside from calling for executions, he gave access to people who wrote/spoke favorably about him, and denied it to those who didn\u2019t.

It was very frustrating. But I realized that the people in charge had about 30 years of inertia on their side and they weren't willing to stick their necks out to do something different. If we stopped doing things that they could historically take credit for being successful, and instead did other things that ended up not appearing successful, it would hurt their career.

Some states have changed their rules since 2020, which could change the timing of when results come in.\n\nIn 2020, the race was not officially called for days after the election, leading experts to preemptively warn the public against expecting to know the results of the race on Tuesday night. Experts also warn that early poll returns do not necessarily indicate the trajectory of the entire election.\n\nVice President Harris and former President Trump are entering Election Day in what polls indicate could be the closest race in recent history.\n\nAccording to The Hill/Decision Desk HQ polling aggregate, Trump and Harris are tied nationally, with 48.4 percent support each.",

This is specifically to prevent pump and dumps like the above commenters believe to be happening. Which from my investment experience, big wigs like directors and CEOs typically make big insider sales for tax purposes, not because they are getting out or the company is tanking. \n\nContextually speaking, to add some validity to my case, you can actually check on [Fintel](https://fintel.io/ss/us/djt) to see the short interest for Trumps stock. Over an hour ago maybe around the time of the article, there were 0 shares available to short. What that means is, institutions borrowed every single share that was available to be borrowed, and sold them, because their outlook is that trump will lose the election resulting in his stock price crashing. So when they buy back the shares at a much lower price than when they sold, they pay what is owe and collect the difference. \n\nThere is absolutely no fucking way in ANY parallel that trump is stupid enough to try and sell his shares the day of the election. He would have had to at the *LATEST*, inform the SEC on Friday, that he would be dumping shares today. Imagine if he fucking did that lmao.\n\n\nEdit: If you already knew all this I apologize and did not mean to insult you.",

If you're a white Hispanic, they just won't consider you white. Even if they do, it doesn't mean you'll be treated equally. White nationalists simultaneously believe race is an objective biological thing that exists *and* that if you have blonde hair and blue eyes but your last name is Rodriguez or Goldstein then you're not actually white. Racists themselves are the biggest proof that race is a social construct and not something biological.\n\n>What really drives me nuts about this is conservative Catholics who don't realize that if Christian Nationalists ever win, they are all in serious danger.\n\nMainstream Christian nationalism in the U.S. tends to be somewhat inclusive of Catholics. After all, many of the prominent figures - Kevin Roberts, JD Vance, Nick Fuentes, John McEntee, etc. - are Catholic. Heck, Peter Thiel and Elon Musks are atheists and part of that movement. \n\nBut it's a temporary and convenient alliance: if they get power, they're gonna set their sights on Catholics, Mormons, Orthodox, any liberal Protestant churches, etc. Latinos are often stuck in a Catholic bubble (language barrier doesn't help) and often don't know that a lot of Evangelical Protestants really hate Catholics.",

They hate us not just for our color, but also our language, religion, culture, music, etc. That's something I often try to get through the heads of white Latinos who vote Republican because they want to be accepted into American whiteness: they hate some white immigrants too. \n\nShit dude, I've heard Canadians say that Anglo right-wingers up there don't even want *Ukrainian* refugees. Those fucks hate the Quebecois for being Catholic and French-speaking, you think they're gonna accept Orthodox Christians who speak a Slavic language and use a different alphabet? White supremacists don't usually support all white groups equally, they almost always have a hierarchy of whiteness and they almost always have certain white groups they hate.

Donald will be gone one way or another. The fascism will still be there in 2028 and beyond. You\u2019ll forget all about Gaza as ancient history.

         "I think a lot of white folks in the U.S. define \"white\" in their head as people who look vaguely Nordic (so basically northern and eastern Europeans). If you look vaguely Mediterranean, they just don't consider you white, even if you're pale. I'm not pale but I'm not tan either, but my hair and eyes are dark brown, I can grow a prickly dense beard, I have a hairy body, and my eyes and nose shape are typical of a Spaniard or Italian (I basically look like a slightly chubby Maluma without tattoos, down to the skin tone and everything).\n\nI work at a retail home improvement store and we don't have uniforms, so we can wear whatever we want (except jewelry when we operate machines). On days where I dress like a \"white\" person (black tee and beige cargos), the Latino customers either ask me questions first in English because they think I'm not Latino, or ask me if I know Spanish because they have a hunch I might be one but they're not sure. If they don't know English, they ask for a translator, and that's when I surprise them with Spanish.\n\nOn days where I dress more stereotypically Latino (baggy blue jeans, white Nike basketball shoes, earrings, thin gold chain and a watch), like 95% of the time the Latino customers immediately ask me questions in Spanish. They just know. In recent years I've been dressing more like this basically as a response to MAGA (I also just like the style) and to signal to other Latinos that I'm one of them and that they can talk to me in Spanish.\n\nI'll tell you this: when I was in K-12, I never perceived myself as being the same race as the blonde/ginger white kids. After all, those kids insisted I wasn't white, and Latinos themselves use \"blanco\" to mean northern Europeans when talking in an American context (in a Latin American context, I would be considered *blanco* by other Latinos, but I suddenly become *not* white when in an American context). So I didn't perceive myself as white because all the cultural messaging I was getting was telling me I wasn't. I perceived myself as Hispanic and nothing else. When I first played Skyrim, I selected Imperial rather than Nord. The cultural messaging runs deep.",

Mixed race people might pass themselves off as Native to get around the social and legal restrictions of being black.\n\nBut out west, Latino, Asian and Native heritage mattered a lot more, like in NE when large Irish populations started to come, or the Mid Atlantic with Italians. \n\nYou can see how narrow whiteness was to some by literature. An insane example is the poem \"*Providence in 2000 A.D*\" by HP Lovecraft, which shows his bigoted view on what is white is very limited, with French and Swedes among the many groups he sneers at it.",

Since Election Day is traditionally where republicans close the gap in states with mail-ins.\n\nThere\u2019s also the fact that Trump encouraged republicans to vote early this time, so that should have increased turnout for early voting for Rs and tipped the scales a little bit away from Election Day voting.

         "As a Pennsylvanian, this was the exact reason I chose to vote on Election Day. I know my state is under the microscope and was afraid that Trump and his cronies could try something to mess up the counting of early votes. There are already thousands of mail ballots in the Philadelphia area alone that have miniscule errors (due to rules put up by Republican legislators) and may not be counted. There is a process to fix the errors and canvassers are working on it but they can't get everyone and I worry that could be enough to swing the results.",
         "> It feels like the US is designed to prevent people from voting whereas most countries try to make it as easy as possible. \n\nWhat do you mean?

What could possibly be the alternative (ignoring voting on a sunday or making the election day a national holiday)??",

         "I dropped mine off in Colorado yesterday morning, and by 4:30 p.m. it was marked as counted.",
         "Probably more like turn around and go to work. I wish I believed you, but there is ABSOLUTELY a point where people will decide to bail. Remember there are people who decided not to vote, so there are surely people who reluctantly decided to vote. Not everyone is as motivated as me or you. If someone was on the fence in the first place, a long line might be the one thing they need to say \"eh, forget it\".",
         "This is not the right attitude to have. Some folks that are voting absentee are being told in certain states their votes won't even be counted unless they're required to win.

         "In Australia, just about every polling booth in the country has a sausage sizzle and a bake sale. Since we have compulsory voting, it's always a guarantee for a good turnout and since most polling booths are at schools, it's a great opportunity for school groups and charities to make a little extra $.\n\nThere is even a Wikipedia article about it: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_sausage \n\nAnd a website for tracking which booty has one available",

         "Well good for them.",
         "In Canada the employer must allow for four (4) hours of free time during voting hours. Thats usually been enough here. I guess the US would need to ensure voting line wait times don't exceed 2-3 hours to make something like that work. Its doable.",
         "In France, voting is on Sundays and your employer is legally obliged to allow you to vote if you work on an election day. \n\nIt would be great to see that implanted in the US",
         "I think the federal govt needs to mandate a certain capacity for a polling place.\n\nThere's no reason for an hours long line. \n\nThere's no reason 1.3 million people can only vote early at one location.",
         "Surely it will not hurt. In others countries service and security forces do vote day before.",
         "It certainly can't hurt to make it a national holiday, but surely the fundamental problem is a lack of polling stations. I live in a large British city and have never waited more than a few minutes to vote, even during the referendum.\u00a0I know you lot use voting machines because of the large number of choices to make at once, but surely it's better to have it be paper-based and slower results in exchange for a polling station every other street in large cities. Put one in every church, every school, every community centre of any kind. If they can organise their normal activities, they can certainly organise the erection of a few wooden polling booths and two people at a table to cross off voters. And have some more operating out of the back of vans in rural areas for good measure.\n\n\nBut I know these issues are at least partly due to fuckery by elected officials, and it astounds me whenever it comes up that the US doesn't have an independent body or bodies for organising elections, drawing boundaries etc., multiple steps removed from democracy and given several layers of protection from interference by elected officials to make it as incorruptible as possible.",

He\u2019s a good promoter. He\u2019s got a sense of how to sell himself. I respect that.\" \n~Robert DeNiro (2011 interview from The Hollywood Reporter)\n\nBy 2018:\n\"Fk Trump! It\u2019s no longer 'Down with Trump.' It\u2019s 'Fk Trump!'\"\n\nWhat happened? \n\nCancel culture gained momentum in 2016 and the #MeToo movement gained steam by 2017 as well as woke culture. \n\nSo pre-2016 Perlman was largely singing his praise as was DeNiro, but by the time cancel culture took off, their rhetoric shifted to align with all the other individuals trying to keep cancel culture off their back. \n\nBefore 2016 Trump was a well-regarded and well-respected business mogul. \n\nWhat happened?\n\nWeinstein happened. \n\nIn October 2016, just before the presidential election, a bombshell story about Harvey Weinstein\u2019s long history of alleged sexual harassment was published by The New York Times. The article detailed years of allegations from women about Weinstein\u2019s inappropriate behavior, which ranged from harassment to assaults.\n\nTrump's remarks:\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve known him for a long time. I\u2019m not surprised to hear it. \u2026 I\u2019ve known him for a long time. I\u2019m not a fan of Harvey Weinstein, and I\u2019ve been saying that for a long time. I was never a fan of his, I can tell you that.\"\n\nWeinstein was a major donor for Trump's political rival Hillary Clinton. \n\nEpstein happened:\n\nThe real estate rivalry between Trump and Epstein occurred in the early 2000's. \n\nTrump was attempting to sell a property in Palm Beach, and Epstein showed interest in buying it. However, the deal fell through. One of the reasons given for this was that Trump was unwilling to sell the property to Epstein after learning more about his activities and the kind of reputation Epstein had developed. This rejection led to a reported confrontation between the two men, and, in a turn of events, Palm Beach police were reportedly called when Epstein became upset.\n\nI know this is very long but it's honestly totally crazy. Like right out of the movies. Trump is freaking vicious. The guy had a hand in strategically bringing down one of the most powerful moguls in Hollywood and even sacrificed himself to do it. Clinton's people release his locker room talk tape and the guy gets even. They all have dirt on each other, but he's a lot better at manipulation. Weinstein was ruined, eaten by his own people and guys like Perlman even said, (paraphrasing) \"Not all of use are equally guilty.\" Ha, something to hide perhaps? \n\nSo no, Trump is not afraid of Kamala IMO.

Definitely not anyone in America's history, or most first world countries for that matter. The combination of circumstances that created his personality, created his career and image, and led to his election feels like some kind of black swan event.\n\nThis is why I don't get too upset at people being blindsided by his victory in 2016. How and why would you possibly prepare for a phenomenon like him?\n\nInternationally, I feel like he has a lot in common with Berlusconi. He was also (seen as) a successful businessman, political outsider, populist, brash, \"impolite\" etc. I don't know that much about his political career but I'm aware of those basics.\n\nYou also have populists like Bolsonaro, and rogue soft authoritarians like Netanyahu and Erdogan where you could draw some comparisons, but many differences too.\n\nIf I'm taking a long view, I personally think and hope that history will remember him as a bizarre blip more than anything. Sort of like how Spain was randomly a fascist dictatorship for like 40 years, but a democracy before and after. Or how Oliver Cromwell overthrew the monarchy but then it was reinstated after him.\n\nTl;dr my take is that W and Reagan are more representative of our political system, and Trump is more of a bizarro detour.",

         "Merchan didn't do that though. However he rationalizes it, he lent Trump a hand by repeatedly delaying his sentencing. The delays in sentencing were 100% political and work to Trump's benefit.\n\nI agree with Judge Chutkan that the only way to treat Trump without being political is to treat him exactly the same as any other defendant would be treated. If Merchan had done that, Trump would have already been sentenced--though not necessarily to jail.\n\nA typical white-collar defendant in a case like Trump's--old, no criminal record--would be likely to receive probation in NY. Trump himself is more of a wild card, because of all the crimes he's obviously committed, yet hasn't been proven guilty of in court. But by the same token, a typical defendant in Trump's situation would not be entitled to multiple adjournments of his sentencing. Maybe one, due to the appellate issue created by the US Supreme Court this past summer. But he should have been sentenced long ago despite that.\n\nAll that being said...if Merchan delayed his sentencing in order to watch how he conducts himself while free during the election...he may end up with a much more solid foundation to sentence Trump to prison. Merchan hasn't made any sort of promise, and can give Trump the max if he determines that Trump deserves it.",

         "Folks, remember:\n\n1: Basically no major cities have reported in yet in most states - they're huge and take time outside a couple of exceptions. Harris is behind right now...and then NY will finish counting and suddenly she'll leap ahead, a few smaller states will finish and Trump will go back etc. etc. Happens all the time since like...FDR?\n\n2: Florida was never really in play and this is specifically by design by the GOP; not only do they have a true believer in DeSantis but he has actively been trying to make the state a worse place in order to drive out anyone more liberal/progressive than a Confederate General. If it wasn't for all the tourist trap places setting up shop way back when, FL would probably be one of the poorest, most abandoned states in the US and they know it.\n\n3: Everyone thought Biden was losing too; until he suddenly wasn't. Calm down.\n\n**EDIT:** Point 4: This was always very likely to be a close election with a good chance of Trump legitimately winning, even if myself and others think he won't. When it's a razor's edge like this, little things going wrong (or right) can tip the balance, so best laid plans and all. Though I would not be surprised if we see something nuts like TX electing Trump President but then also electing Allred for Senate dumping Cruz (because everyone hates Cruz even in the GOP) so it could be a interesting night.",

These counties have less people and therefore, count first and then report in. That causes the red mirage, because it shows a number that's disproportionally weighted to the Republican. \n\nBut - and this is critical and why you all need to pop a Xanny or something - the massive, blue cities report in later when the counts are completed there.\n\nSo here's your trick. If you see a vote proportion that you don't like, look at the critical \"**X% REPORTING**\". If it's below 50%, the state is nowhere near done counting and cities likely are nowhere near reported. If it's over 50% and above, that's where you need to start to watch it closely. Even a 90% reported state can flip if the vote tallies are close enough.\n\nTLDR: Relax and stop acting like the sky is falling, Henny Penny.",

         "From the WXIA-TV article:\n\n\"Over 4 million ballots were cast during early voting, with more than half of Georgia\u2019s 7.2 million registered voters already participating. An additional 1 million votes are expected by the time polls close, marking another significant turnout for the Peach State.\n\nRaffensperger, speaking at a press conference, emphasized efforts to enhance voter security and speed in reporting. Raffensperger noted that voters have experienced short wait times, with average check-in times under a minute. \n\n\"It\u2019s been smooth sailing by and large,\" he said. \u201cAverage line time in Georgia right now is two minutes.\"\n\nAccording to Senate Bill 189, which mandates reporting early and absentee ballots within one hour after polls close at 7 p.m., nearly all early votes should be in by 8 p.m., Raffensperger said. Smaller counties aim to finalize counts by 10:30 p.m., positioning Georgia to have a clearer election outcome than in past cycles.\"",
         "If I'm understanding correctly, when polls close, we're already going to have those 4 million early and mail in votes pretty much counted. If we're seeing a big gap there, it's not unlikely that gap will remain due to such a high percentage of people having already voted.\n\nIf Kamala takes Georgia, there's a pretty good chance Trump's cooked.

Philadelphia county is the lone exception to that, which is honestly not even that upsetting, since Philly County has 1.5 million people in it, whereas fully half of PA's 67 counties don't even have 1.5 million total people in them *combined*.  It's a dense damned county.\n\nHowever, that one county is significant: without it, we likely can't be sure of the winner.  So PA probably won't be called until Philadelphia County is almost fully counted.  I think the only thing that will allow for an early calling of Pennsylvania is if there is a clear blue shift in non-Philly metro counties from 2020 to 2024.  If \"within 1% of dead even\" regions like the Pittsburgh and Harrisburg metro areas suddenly are definitively voting for Harris, then the state is absolutely overall going for her.",

So it will be quicker to count them.\n\nBut those voters are roughly 60% Democratic votes so there should be around a 350k Democrat advantage in early votes.  \n\nMy point is that the in-person votes will look like a Republican advantage again and then the early votes will start closing the gap.\n\nSo buckle up for Pennsylvania.",

Hilary was 11k behind.\n\nThen 2020, Trump is at 2.6m, the first statistically large republican voter count in 2 decades, and Biden showed up with 2.8m.\n\nIn what world does Trump increase above 2.6m or Harris drop below it? \n\nWe'll see michigan go 2.7m for Trump as his ceiling and HOPEFULLY 2.9m+ to harris.

         "\n\nBush won Florida by 900 votes initially. Upon recount, he still won but only by 317 votes. A hand recount was ordered for 4 specific counties, as allowed by law. Specifically Gore requested a manual recount of 62,000 ballots where no presidential candidate was selected due to the \"hanging chads.\" \n\nThe Florida Secretary of State certified that Bush had won the election before the recounts were completed. Gore sued the Secretary of State and the Florida Supreme Court sided with Gore, allowing the recounts to finish. Bush appealed to the US Supreme Court and they immediately halted the recount. \n\nSo not quite as clear cut as you portray it.

It's dishonest to say it's a stupid argument to not like how they chose their candidate because she was already VP. It's entirely dishonest.\n\nI think you know this.

Biden is simply not mentally there. I do believe that it has been obvious for a while that he wasn\u2019t mentally fit and he never should have been running for a second term to begin with. That\u2019s the problem I have with it. The people could have picked between Harris, Newsom, Buttigieg, Moore, Whitmer, Shapiro, etc. Instead Kamala was picked for the people when she had the lowest approval rating of a vice president in American history. \n\nNot saying to not vote for her just saying don\u2019t let the party you back off so easy just because the other party is acting worse.",

Even when removing Joe. It was not guaranteed that it would be Harris. That is a lie or you are miseducated. That\u2019s not how the primary works. If Joe had to step down while in office it would work like that, but not during a primary.\n\nHere is an article talking about how the democrats would replace Biden in the event he steps down: https://apnews.com/article/biden-harris-dnc-next-steps-2024-election-13bbcca73ca682f16284cf8874011dfa\n\nKamala simply taking over for him is not how the primary  election works.",

The alternative would have been a deeply damaging convention with lots of mud slinging and hurt feelings all around. And less unity means less voters.",
         "> I understand why it happened but was not a fan\n\nthere are no alternatives to offer other than \"hold a surprise primary election season across the country on no notice 2 months before the election\" which is a completely nonsensical suggestion.  \n\nthe ONLY viable option here would be \"Biden must run for re-election and lose\" which is, obviously, what the GOP wanted.  but there is no rule or law that requires this.  they just want to win, they don't give a shit about democracy.  they are THE party of suppressing votes and trying to overturn elections.  criticisms of the Dems being undemocratic are projection and deflection, and while I don't want to be a dick, buying into those frivolous comments is beneath an informed, intelligent person.",
         "When the primaries are over, yes, it is how it works. There were really not too many other options. Anyone else would have had to start from scratch, and there was no fucking way that a fast primary could have been done.",
         "There was not enough time for that, my guy and she secured 98% of delegates at the convention. \n\nThe other thing that you're failing to realize is, nobody was going to challenge her in a primary to potentially damage her chances in the general. Her two biggest challengers would have been Whitmer and Newsom, both of which are angling for 2028.",
         "Thanks for the insight!",
         "I hate to be the one to tell you this, but this argument has been made since at least the 70s.\n\n\"This isn't about policy, it's about how scary the other side is.\"\n\nThis argument has been made for a very long time. Much longer than Trump has been a candidate. I maintain my position, dehumanizing those that disagree with you politically is a gross state of being.",
         "r/redditsniper",
         "You're jumping over their argument against this.\n\nYes, there wasn't a lot of time. That's the issue. They have known of Biden's decline for much longer than this. They could have forced a primary but instead hid it until it was too late to.\n\nAgain, I think Harris was genuinely their only choice here, but I'm not so blind to think this was always the case. I find their decision to hide this and then dodge the primary process as a result, to be pretty disgusting myself. \n\nIf you can't empathize with this position, then you're being intentionally daft for the sake of partisanship or undeserved loyalty.\n\nYou can support the dems, hate Trump, all at the same time as being disappointed in how Harris was chosen. There is no inconsistency here. Maybe you genuinely don't care, but scolding others for caring is dishonest.",

         "I was reading a book about Reagan and FDR recently and the way that both of those men shaped our modern political landscape is astounding. Reagan in particular, everything about him screamed 'proto-Trump' it was uncanny. Immediately there's the obvious comparisons such as how they were both divorced despite campaigning on a religious platform or that Trump and Reagan were both celebrities turned politicians - though Trump's transition was much more dramatic - however their rhetoric also seems to be strikingly similar. I guess Reagan also severely leaned into this super-evangelical  'America is God's chosen land' rhetoric that's become disturbingly prominent with the GOP. Furthermore he also had the same 'just keep say things with enough confidence and it becomes reality' philosophy that Trump seems to have when giving a speech. I suppose that, like Trump, many of the anecdotes and facts Reagan would share in speeches were just patently false but because he said it with enough conviction his supporters would believe it. It also doesn't help that the political philosophy of both presidents is shaped by convincing American's that they're victims of high taxation, something which is bitterly ironic to anyone aware of taxation statistics. Finally, though a bit pedantic, I guess Reagan also believed in astrology meaning Trump was nowhere near the first time complete pseudoscience had entered the white house, though even then at the time it seems like conservatives had enough of a spine to criticize Reagan for this while nowadays conservatives celebrate Trump for believing conspiracy theories.\n\nObviously there's differences, Reagan for example at least demonstrated some level of competency and respectability that Trump seriously lacks, but the similarities are staggering. In my mind Reagan was really just the template for creating an absolutely god-awful president like Trump.",

Goldwater later had a lot of regrets over the Southern Strategy and gets a pass for people who don't know about his campaign against LBJ in '64.\n\nBack then, sweeping the South (in opposition to LBJ signing the Civil Rights Act) wasn't enough for Goldwater to win, but it unified the Southern segregationists under the Republican tent for the first time. But people like a winner, and Goldwater got crushed. So the strategy didn't really bear a success until Reagan. Nixon was broadly popular, and didn't need to leverage segregationist sentiment or \"Law and Order\" rhetoric (again, the idea that the President should be involved in our local policing was something that Goldwater famously brought back into Republican policy).\n\nRegan famously changed a lot of policies, antitrust is one with a lot of consequences.

But **in his role as** a politician, he was literally the most central leader of the early shift of the Republican party to openly supporting racism and fascism.",

A Trump vote in Massachusetts or a Harris vote in Oklahoma hold the same impact as a Chase Oliver or Cornel West in the majority of this country. \n\nThe main difference? \n\nVoting third party means that if a third party gets five percent, they get federal election funding.

Neither the Republican or Democratic parties want RCV, though, because it would squash their holds on voting power in the US. Both parties want you to be compliant, pick a side, and just shut up.

I agree with you about Glass-Steagall, plus, honestly, a majority of Americans bought the bullshit, or close to a majority in the case of Bush/Gore.\n\nIt is not unfair to hold the Republican party accountable for their platform over the prior 40 years.

A lot of people were just literally destroyed, so they could live in a fancier house.\n\nI think the most damaging thing in the 90's was the change in the patent laws, which occurred under Clinton and made r & d much less profitable in the United States.

It should be taught at a very young age that voting matters, they should be given school and class elections to vote on and shown how they work on a simpler scale, as they get older start to bring them into the details of how different voting systems work, regulations on voting in their own state and others, how to find information, etc. Once they get into high school teach them about government budgets and taxes, gdp, how different levels of government affect and change local, state and federal business practices and community programs, etc. Get them invested in it over time and you may still have those who stand out at the election day but you'll give them enough understanding for them to at least make an informed decision to not vote or to vote for a 3rd party rather than all of the people who sit at home and either say they don't care, don't understand or quote talking points from twitter and reddit as a reason to not vote.",

The problem is that free resources like podcasts are very poorly sourced (like ultra popular Dan Carlin) or just really dry to listen to, but they got me hooked on wanting better history content. \n\nThe best bang for my buck has been a Wondrium/Great Courses (for some reason they keep going back and forth on those names) subscription, you get history courses taught by actual professors, not just hobbyists like Carlin, and you can either watch the courses or just listen to them.  I\u2019ve found the history ones are easy to just listen to, although sometimes I\u2019ll switch to video on my phone to see a map or painting or what have you.  \n\nThe primary American history course on there is very extensive and exhaustive.  There are three main history lecturers on that one, the first of whom I enjoyed very immensely who covered from colonial America on through 1850 or so with a strong focus on American civics through that time.  I learned a lot about those presidents, some Supreme Court justices through that time, even prominent Speakers of the House, Senate majority leaders, etc.\n\nThe next lecturer covered basically from Buchanan (President just before Lincoln) on through the end of Reconstruction (1877 compromise I referenced above), and I liked him a lot but it was obviously very battle focused and the guy\u2019s style was a bit jarring to me relative to the previous lecturer.  \n\nI liked the last lecturer least of all, not that he was bad, it just really didn\u2019t fit the rest of the lecture course narrative. He basically skipped over all presidents from 1877 on through Teddy, citing they were all mostly terrible presidents who aren\u2019t worth paying attention to (and I was like that\u2019s WHY I want to learn more about them! lol), but it was still some valuable big picture stuff where I learned a lot.  \n\nThat final lecturer did leave off with a very chilling note though, basically he mentioned that as a British person, he found the peaceful transition of power amongst administrations one of the best things about all of American history.  I had chills up my spine listening to that and being worried about what Trump was going to do should he lose.  For that reason alone (200+ years of peaceful power transitions, the hallmark of American democracy going back to Jefferson/Adams just cast aside by Trump), Donald J Trump is the worst president in history, in my opinion.",

If the US removed the two party registration, making everyone \"Undeclared\" or just nothing, make the day a national holiday so it gives everyone the opportunity and also everyone is automatically registered to vote at 18 then I think we'd be better off.\n\nEDIT:  This response took off.  Later we discuss that making it a holiday isn't enough.  Making sure proper protection is in place to allow for workers that have to work be it hospitals, food service, fire/police, 24 hour IT positions.  Feel free to correct me further, but the employee protection now only says that if you're working while polls are open that employers have to allow you to vote.  Leaving an 8 hour shift to vote might not be covered by all slimy employers if you had the opportunity to vote prior to or after said shift.",

         "More people would vote.\n\nRepublicans hate people voting.",
         "I know it's a popular idea but having a federal holiday for Election Day would not really benefit the lower income workers and the working poor, who happen to be the people most likely to need a little help getting their votes in.  Middle class, white collar workers would cast their votes early -- either by mail, early in person, or just stupidly early in the morning on Election Day -- then hit the shopping malls, bars, or restaurants, while retail, hospitality and gig workers had business as usual. \n\nBetter suggestions would be federal minimums on drop boxes and polling places per 10k residents; federal minimums on in-person polling hours on weekends, late nights and early mornings; longer periods of early voting; and same-day registration.",
         "Even with an extra two weeks of early voting, some lines were still 2 hours long. What if all the millions of citizens had to vote on one day, as Trump keeps fantasizing about. Even if it was a holiday, the millions could stand in line for 24 hours and still not reach the polls.",
         "If election day was a holiday, low-income people would still have to work. Even on holidays, people working at grocery stores, gas stations, warehouses, restaurants, uber, trucking, agriculture, etc. still need to work. It might not even encourage higher-income people to vote. If I didn't have to work today, I would have used a vacation day yesterday and taken a nice 4-day weekend trip somewhere, so I'd be less likely to vote. \n\nThe real solution is universal mail-in ballots and at least 1 week of early in-person voting.",
         "That would be nice... for government employees. Meanwhile, the average working person most likely isn't getting the day off at their private business. And now it's even harder for parents who now have to figure out what to do with their kids that day. \n\nDon't make it a holiday. Movie it to the weekend. Sure, people still work on weekends, but a lot fewer people do.",
         "People have to work on holidays too. It doesn't really matter. As long as there are a lot of early voting and mail-in options everyone should be able to vote. Making the process more than one day, as has happened lately, is the real answer.",

         "Answer: Republicans have blocked every attempt to move voting day to the weekend or declare it a national holiday.\n\nWhy would they do that?\n\nWhile Republicans have a very loud and enthusiastic voting bloc, they have very unpopular stances on most issues and rarely produce any specific plans other tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans and corporations. On other issues, they offer only grievances and vague claims to \"fix\" them without saying how (see Trump's \"concepts of a plan\" after 10 years of attacking and trying to kill the ACA).\n\nBecause their platform is unpopular to people who understand and pay attention to the issues, they get support by creating culture wars and outrage by spinning isolated incidents into full-blown nation-wide disasters that will destroy families and threaten safety (see trans people using restrooms or the powerful Christian majority somehow being constantly under threat and \"forced\" to attack religious freedom for all other religions so that they can survive), and calling their opponents scary buzzwords that don't even mean what the Republican base thinks they mean (communist, Marxist, socialist, etc.) and are not remotely true of the people they label with their name-calling.\n\nBut even with the rabid base they earn from these culture wars, they're still in the minority. So they use every tool in their disposal to limit the vote, throw out votes, and select their voters. The more voters there are, the less likely Republicans will win. That's why mid-term elections without the presidential vote on the ballot often rewards Republicans because many people don't bother voting in those \"less important\" elections\u2014but the rabid Republicans would never miss a vote. Most importantly, it comes down to Republicans choosing their voters by gerrymandering districts (cutting them into crazy shapes so that they'll mathematically reduce Democratic votes into fewer districts\u2014a state with 10 districts where Democrats soundly win the popular vote will often fall to Republican control anyway by numbers like 7-3 because of gerrymandering. And then the electoral college gives extraordinary power to rural communities and low population states, making the overall popular vote irrelevant to who actually wins the presidency. For example, when a voter in the densely populated state of California votes, that vote has something like 1/50 the power of someone who lives in a cabin in the woods of Montana. The GOP then uses all of these advantages that got them in power to keep those advantages in place: they protect their \"right\" to gerrymander and choose their voters, they insist on keeping the electoral college to cancel out the popular vote, they want the filibuster to suppress the voter's desires once in office, and they appoint partisan judges to lock in unpopular partisan positions as the law of the land, and they block legislative votes from even taking place on things majority (sometimes in 90% range) desperately want... like a national holiday for voting, sensible gun laws, immigration reform (so they can use it as an outrage issue), etc.\n\nWhy don't the voters get angry and turn on the Republicans for all of this manipulation? Well, because the media on the right paints an entirely different reality from the one we all live in that propels all of those concocted outrages into the mainstream conversations. The media outlets in the middle fear being called biased so much, they both-sides every argument even when one side is not operating in good faith... and it gives credibility to the craziness on the far right as if it could be real. And then the people on the left trying to herd people back to reality are labeled far left extremists and soundly ignored\u2014except for the ones already sitting inside their bubble. So, no matter how far the right drifts away from reality, the media follows them into their fever dreams making them seem real... which in a way, kind of makes them real simply because that's how they're perceived.\n\nBut the vast majority of Americans\u2014when asked about the issues without party identification\u2014agree on most everything. So it benefits Republicans to keep information low so their faithful don't realize how their policies hurt them, and keep their loyal followers turning out by hammering them with a barrage of disinformation and outrage\u2014while keeping Democratic turn-out low by creating helplessness and apathy over the lack of knowledge on the other side and the impotence of actual facts.\n\nHowever, if Democrats get fired up and show up, Republicans will lose every time. So they want voting to be hard, they want to choose who gets to vote, and they want to dictate how they vote.",

Those that are still required to/need to work, should be mandated 4 hours of PTO to go vote. If they only need 30 minutes, they can go back to work and bank that PTO like any other time off.

Like, it's not difficult for the government to validate citizenship if they're doing their job.\n\nWhen I do my taxes in Canada, I check a box that says \"please share my details with the Elections Canada\". The government checks their own data to make sure I'm a citizen. Then when election time comes around, whether federal or provincial, I get a voter information card that tells me where to vote. I'm already registered. When I arrive at the voting station, I show my ID and the person at the desk checks that against their list of voters assigned to that polling station.\n\nIf I die, someone filling out my taxes make a mark noting that I'm dead and they don't check the box to give my details to the Election board. If I move, I put my new address on my tax forms, and I check the box. The voter information card is sent to my new address automatically.\n\nNow, if I move before I can do that, that's about the only time that things get hairy. But even then I can still vote by mail for my previous riding. Yes, I'd have to wait until filing my taxes again to be able to vote in my new riding, but, again, it's all done automatically.

Automatic voter registration isn't a thing in the US, but it should be, and it could be even at the state level because the state government knows all the same information about you that the federal government does.\n\nEven homeless people have SSNs, and vouching is still a recognized practice in much of the US. The census and government ID covers the people that don't file taxes. The solutions are simple. The fear of those solutions is what holds many politicians back.",
         "AFAIK rolls are regularly cross-check for the recently deceased to remove them from the books and identifying this kind of fraud is done after an election. While it might be possible to register in other people's names, the voter registration cards would be mailed to them tipping people off. \n\nThen it would be logistically very difficult to vote as other people on a scale that mattered. You have to show up to the right polling place, state the right name, and sign like the other person in the case of the deceased. What are you going to do, drive all around town to vote 3 or 4 times? Get back in line and hope they don't recognize you the second time you come through as somebody different? It might work for a few individuals, but organizing something like that to get thousands of votes ain't going to happen and combine this lack of payoff with a huge penalty if you're caught. Nope. Couldn't convince me this is real.\n\nBack in 2016 when \"bus loads of illegals were voting!\" I tried going over how exactly that plan would work with friends that would argue with me, so I thought it through. I didn't realize at the time they'd argue any insane thing that came out of that man's mouth because it's part of his \"power\" to disseminate lies.",
         "The government in the US doesn't track where you live unless you tell them. This is primarily done through voter registration, driver's license registration, or when you pay taxes. When you get a driver's license, almost every state offers you the option to register to vote at the same time. When you file your taxes, there's often an option to be sent info on registering to vote.\n\nOther than driver's licenses, the government (state and federal) doesn't really have a database of where everyone lives. Even then, many people don't have driver's licenses, and many often don't update their DL when they move to a new address (although you're supposed to). Your address on tax returns is only updated when you file, and there's not really a way to change your address between annual filings.\n\nMost European countries require you to register your residence. We don't have this in the US. Registering to vote is essentially the same thing, except it's optional.",
         "yeah I think that kind of fraud voting would be useless.  A kind that might matter may be someone trying to generally slip in a giant stack of faked election ballets prefilled out swapping them with a stack that is already approved or ran through.  Then somehow get the original automated count questioned or thrown out so that they can do a hand count, thereby now counting that new stack in the manual count."
