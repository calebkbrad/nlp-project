         "Just reposting from another comment but\u2026My big takeaway is this...\n\nWhen it comes to the American electorate, nothing \u2013absolutely NOTHING \u2013 is more important to voters then \u201ckitchen table issues\u201d (price of gas, physical safety from crime, etc.) \u2013 not the character of the candidate, not human rights, not even the survival of democracy itself.\n\nSHOULD things be that way? Highly debatable. ARE things that way? Yes. Dems need to acknowledge that, and campaign accordingly.",
         ">The key to understanding the Trump era is that the real divide in America is not between left and right but between pro-system and anti-system politics.\u00a0\n\nGood article and this makes sense to me. I think the Dems look at issues as a policy and ideology debate but that's not the prism many voters use.\n\nPeople on the left keep saying with exasperation, \"But what trump policies do you actually support?!\" and they are missing the point. His voters aren't going to be swayed by a policy paper. They are voting for a personality.\n\nThat was first hit home for me back in 2016 when acquaintances of mine who were pro-Bernie switched to Trump after Clinton edged him out. Their switch seemed crazy to me then, but over time I get it more and more and the Democrats need to figure it out.",
         "This what we get for them not holding Trump responsible for any of his crimes back in 2021. He should have been arrested way before his political status was an issue. \n\nThe Democratic Party has no teeth, their leadership is too weak to compete against a thug like Trump. I hope they undergo a complete overhaul of their top brass over the next three years because they obviously cannot win - even against a convicted felon.",
         "The real problem is the ever dwindling amount of education and the gigantic influx of propaganda and misinformation.\n\nLook at the things Trump supporters say and believe, they are voting based on things that aren\u2019t even real or entirely misunderstood. \n\nThey aren\u2019t voting based on on facts or reality but what they are told the facts are. The emperical evidence can be in front of there fact and it doesn\u2019t matter. \n\nThis coupled with the fact they are down economically with no help in sight makes a whole half of the country manipulatable. Add that in with the plain old American conservative values and racism and you have the recipes for a right wing explosion. \n \nIt\u2019s gonna be a long road back from this, could take decades.",
         "Biden made a huge mistake by running again.  He should have stepped aside so that a proper primary could be run and Democrats could get a more legitimate candidate.  Harris simply didn't have the legitimacy that a candidate gets by winning the primary.  I think Newsom could have won the primary and general elections but he chose not to run because of Biden.",

Do away with superdelegates.",
         "They made 2 big mistakes IMO. \n\nNot having Biden drop out earlier to have a legit primary .\n\nTrying to appeal to republicans. Cheney and talking about the border wasn\u2019t gonna pull them. Nothing Will. Should have leaned on Walls progressive wins. Should have ran in free lunch and college. Bringing people up, instead of hanging out with failed republicans. \n\nI still don\u2019t excuse the non voters. There are times when it\u2019s important to swallow your pride and vote lesser of 2 evils",
         "Campaigning with Liz Cheney and being proud of Dick Cheney\u2019s endorsement probably was a giant mistake. Since when do democrats want to be associated with neocons?",
         "I\u2019m sorry but it\u2019s extremely important to realize just how god damn apathetic democrats are. \n\nThis party has constantly road the coattails of liberalism and the protection of individual rights, which has consistently earned votes and unwavering support, yet have completely failed to capitalize on positions of power as the GOP mobilized and rallied behind a single candidate (which they always do, but Trump is Trump).\n\nYou\u2019ve heard it all through this election cycle that minority groups like Black men have just been completely left behind over the years, working class support for democrats has just consistently eroded yet is paved over by endorsements from labor union elites, and democrats have consistently entertained the same dark money that has flooded conservative politics while batting an eye at the double standard.\n\nThis party has been perfect at attracting support on the basis that \u201cwe\u2019ll get it right next time\u201d and has consistently taken that for granted. Losing by tight margins means that there\u2019s just more outreach that has to happen, but losing by this margin against Donald fucking Trump means that your message, your philosophy and future is dead in the water.\n\nDemocrats desperately need to soul search, and it\u2019s gonna be a bloodbath. Time to cull members of the party and create an actual philosophy and fucking run on it.",
         "Dems need to appeal to normal people. They act like beauracrats and don't use the simple messaging that works like pro on gun ownership, pro on private property, pro on strong border(can still be pro immigration with a well protected border), pro on freedom of speech, pro on retirement for hard workers(lowering retirement age, protecting social security), pro on protection of hunting lands (i.e conservation)... etc, etc.... Most people care about shit like this. We could still push many great progressive policies through in America if we just also catered to the average mostly uneducated person.  Why can't they just learn to spin the policies that many of us agree with into words and phrases that the average joe can understand... they use such college text book politicians while the average person can understand the frustrations of  an idiot like Trump but not from someone like Kamala who gives off an air of superiority even though i'm certain democrats werent purposely trying to make her and their candidates seem like that.",
         "> *The key to understanding the Trump era is that the real divide in America is not between left and right but between pro-system and anti-system politics. Pro-system politics is the bipartisan consensus of establishment Democrats and Republicans: it\u2019s the politics of NATO and other military alliances, of trade agreements, and of deference to economists (as when they say that price gouging isn\u2019t the cause of inflation). Trump stands for no fixed ideology, but rather a general thumbing of the nose at this consensus. The main fact of American politics in the post-Obama era is that an ever larger majority of Americans are angry at the status quo and open to anti-system politics.*\n\nYes.  This is what the MAGA-sphere has been saying since Bernie was thrown under the bus.  \n\nThe 1990's-2000's uniparty that was created by Bill Clinton COULD NOT ENDURE.  One of the two parties was going to be the first to break for populism, whether right populism or left populism, and the one that didn't was going to be left holding the bag of crony politics.  This is why Trump won the presidency, and the Democrats now have the dubious honor of Cheney's support.\n\n**The Democrats COULD HAVE AVOIDED THIS.**\n\nBut that would have meant letting Sanders win in 2016.",
         "We need to hold the fucking media accountable.\n\n\nMaga dipshits believe actual lies. Violent crime is down and the economy is up but you would never, ever know that if you watched Fox News. \n\n\nThey are literally just lying and it has worked twice now. They are going to fuck America for generations.\n\n\n\nThis might actually be unfixable now.",

         "It's because a gallon of milk costs twice as much as it did under Trump. We're paying way more for everything even when many aspects of our economy and job market is doing well. Americans are gonna blame high costs on the government and ignore the positives of the economy because high costs hit them personally in real life every day. Even if it's unfair to blame the president.\n\nEveryone is playing mental gymnastics here as to why Dems lost but it's really simple. People are mad about high costs and every time they pay for something and shake their heads in frustration they love to take it out on the government. If Trump was the president during the last 4 years he would have gotten beat last night because people would blame him for inflation.\n\nDems were unlucky. We'll get another chance in 2026 and 2028 and Trump will be gone. Just deal with the reality of the situation. Republicans won. This too shall pass.",

         "Oh I blame the dem voters for not showing up. Trump didn\u2019t gain much overall. The dem voters just didn\u2019t show up. Something like 15-18 million less voters for Harris compared to Biden with Trump\u2019s total staying relatively equal.\n\nAnd Joe Biden. Biden fucked us by dropping out in July rather than start of the year. Even if we ran a primary, we needed more time than 100 days to catch up to Trump. \n\nNo dem was winning this year. That was made clear by this result.",
         "I don't see how history doesn't pin this on Biden. He said he'd run one term, then he reneged on it. Then he said he is good to battle Trump, then he backed out so late nobody could run a primary.\n\nLike how is this not Biden's fault? If he had actually one-termed it would have given the full field of Dems 2+ years to find the best candidate and build hype.",

Period. \n\nYou meet your customers where they\u2019re at. \n\nSaying the economy is great when it is in fact NOT is not going to get you anywhere. So tired of talking about gdp gains and inflation dropping to 2%.\n\nInflation dropping is not the same as prices going down. It means they are rising more slowly. GDP means fuck all when 40% of Americans can\u2019t afford a surprise $400 expense. Being detached from reality is more than just a reddit problem. Dem leadership are completely detached from their constituents. Period.\n\nStop blaming apathy and voter suppression nonsense. People weren\u2019t inspired to vote, so they didn\u2019t. Sure, there\u2019s some baked-in ignorance, but a certain point you need to reflect on your messaging.\n\n$1B in ads and you lost ground across the entire country.

         "Look, it's completely fair to say that the Democratic party could've done this or that better.\n\nBut at the end of the day, I really don't think Kamala was a bad candidate, nor do I think she ran a bad campaign. She didn't win, but that doesn't mean she was bad or did a bad job.\n\nIt's frustrating that more people didn't go out and vote for her, but it's also very frustrating that Republican voters continue to bend the knee for Donald Trump.\n\nI'm sorry, but I don't know how anyone with any level of decency can look at this choice and think Trump is a better candidate. He's a rich old asshole that acts like a toddler, he tried to overthrow the government because he didn't like that he lost the last election, he whines about unsubstantiated election fraud, he's very openly misogynistic and bigoted, and he fetishizes dictators. Sure, Harris may not be \"perfect\", but between the two, it should be a no brainer who is the adult in the room.\n\nBut instead, Republican voters continue bending the knee to Trump because they like when he acts like an internet edgelord, and they scream about \"Big Macs cost $1000 now, it's all the Dems' fault, rawr!\".\n\nAre there lessons to be learned here for the democratic party? Sure. But let's not pretend Harris was a \"bad\" candidate simply because she wasn't perfect. If people still look at Trump, the nearly 80 year old rich asshole con man criminal bigoted insurrectionist, and go \"That's my guy!\", I think it's pretty clear that there's something very broken in the minds of a lot of people.\n\nIn any case, it doesn't really matter any longer. Odds are, this was the last proper election. We've pretty likely thrown away democracy in favor of installing a giant toddler wannabe-dictator as our king.",
         "The dems just need to realize the game has changed. Running on policy and good ideas and trying to actually run the country effectively will not work. Propaganda, lies, and disinformation do work. \n\nWe all hoped that Trump would go away and we could go back to politics as usual pre 2016. The problem was never Trump it was our dumbass electorate. Republicans figured out even before Trump that you could convince idiots or anything and Trump mastered it. \n\nDems won\u2019t win anything until they treat us like the idiots we are and stop trying to treat us like adults who understand multiple word sentences.",
         "THANK YOU.\n\nI didn't know a single person excited for Kamala IRL. Everyone I knew said she was going to lose and she did. Put up an actually electable person who can talk, has real opinions, actual policy beyond talking about their opponent and how bad they are, and has a chance.\n\nI refuse to believe she was the best person the DNC had for the job. She was the one the elite donors wanted, and they fucked the ENTIRE COUNTRY due to their hubris.\n\nHalf the r/politics board is still 'KAMALA WINS X' stories. This place has become a horrific echo chamber with no ability to accept the reality of the situation. Telling everyone \"SUCK IT UP AND VOTE FOR THE BAD CANDIDATE, OR DO YOU WANT TRUMP?\" clearly isn't a working strategy. You can't shame people into voting if they can just stay home. \n\nThere are better candidates. Run them. Don't run a bad one and you won't have to spend the whole election cycle propping them up. It was clear she wasn't ready and her policies weren't her own.",
         "It\u2019s almost as if forcing through an unpopular candidate is the quickest way to lose an election\n\nBefore Biden dropped out people were apathetic towards Harris at best. She didn\u2019t do well in the primaries in 2020. Then the whole Biden dropping out last minute seemed like an easy way to hand the nomination to Harris.\n\nDemocrats need to let the voters pick the candidate, enough of this \u201cit\u2019s my turn\u201d bullshit",

         "The democrats lost the election, so of course they deserve blame. But misinformation has a hold on people in this country to a degree that I didn\u2019t fully understand until last night",
         "Biden should never have run for reelection, should have committed to running a single term only.\n\nKnowing this, he should never have picked Kamala Harris as his VP.\n\nIt was essential that someone popular and able to unit the party, a proven vote winner in democratic presidential primaries be chosen.\n\nKamala Harris was none of those things. She wasn't even popular among progressive democrats.\n\n\\-------------\n\nOf course...the REAL mistake here belongs to the Clinton cronies in the DNC, who persuaded Biden NOT to run in 2016 against Trump, because it was Clintons turn.\n\nI think Biden would have won. Biden remains the only person to have beaten Trump, and he got more votes than any other president in our history.\n\nIf Biden had run in 2016, his 2nd term would have been 2020. He was still totally sharp and physically fit in 2020, would have had no problems winning a 2nd term, IMO.\n\n\\-------------\n\nIt's also the fault of the media, who lied to us and told us Joe Biden in 2024 was sharp, the best he's ever been, better than cogent! No concerns here whatsoever! They lied to us and gaslit us right up until Biden blew himself up on a debate stage in front of the whole world and their lies could no longer convince anyone. But by then it was almost too late.\n\nSo then the media pivoted to telling us how amazing and popular Kamala was and how quickly she was uniting the entire democratic coalition and how her campaign was just so full of joy joy joy.\n\nThen she pulls in , what, 20 million fewer votes than Biden in 2020?\n\n\\-----------\n\nThe lesson here is that the DNC and the media are constantly lying to democratic voters and can't be trusted. the DNC seems to go out of its way to prevent the candidates that people are most excited about from winning. They were FURIOUS when Obama beat out Hillary and determined to not let it happen again, so they kneecapped Sanders over and over and then refused to give us a primary to pick Biden's replacement.",
         "As a conservative, I think people on the left need to stop getting into policy proscriptions and looking for this or that issue that is going to win and look at the actual candidates themselves.\n\n\nIf you look at the past two Democrats who won the presidency, you can easily see the difference between them and the most recent losers.\u00a0\n\n\nGoing back a few elections you can see a pattern with the type of candidates who were chosen.\n\n\nGore\nKerry\nHRC\nKamala\nI'm going to include Biden even though he won.\n\n\nThey were all liked by their bases but could not really connect with average people. They were stuffy,\u00a0 not very quick-witted, not extremely likable, and oftentimes seemed rambling or boring. Hillary was a great example of someone highly touted inside the party but very disliked outside of it. None of them had easily discernable messages or a tagline that could be intimated quickly and without explanation.\n\n\nYou need charismatic, likable candidates with a simple, solid message that can be understood by the average idiot. You need someone who can trounce an opponent in a debate and do it without seeming haughty or holier-than-thou. I liked Bernie back in the day and I think Buttigeg would be a great candidate as well.\u00a0\n\n\nI think getting into excuses and conspiracy theories is not fruitful or a good use of time and effort. I feel like the focus after Hillary lost should not have been Russia, it should have been Hillary. The question should not have been why did the stars align against us...it should have been who do we put forward that can win.\u00a0",

         "This sounds bad but I believe it\u2019s true.\n\nThere is a significant portion of voters that will never vote for a black person.

But they view their choice between the guy who wants to give them money (cut inflation) and the lady who wants to give free sex changes to transgendered illegal immigrants (only a mild exaggeration)\n\nIt\u2019s a false choice. Of course it is. But the GOP has been phenomenal at driving voter turnout by social wedge issues distracting voters from the Democratic economic message. We know liberal economic policies work better for the average person. We know that generally their policies (social security, Medicare, ACA, minimum wage increase etc) are favored by the majority of voters. But we know that Democrats do an awful job of messaging and become the party of \u201cwoke\u201d instead of the \u201cparty that has brought you almost all the good stuff you have\u201d",

Put all the evidence out in public. Let Jack Smith do it and tell the world everything over the next 60 days, Biden can pre-emptively pardon Jack Smith for leaking the documents before he leaves office to make sure republicans don't go after him, but I have no doubt they will anyway. That's been done before and upheld. Maybe Biden can release the documents himself, he's old and may not give a shit. He is one of the few people in the world who know the full truth about what Trump did and is probably fucking pissed and full of rage right now.\n\nGiving out the evidence won't ruin any court cases because they will never happen anyway. They may sway voters in 2026/2028 or help people realize that they've been swindled. Maybe it does nothing. But at least the world will know the truth and **history** will definitively know if Trump is a traitor to the country or not. If we don't learn it before Trump takes office, everything gathered during the investigations will be destroyed and history will always be debating whether Trump was actually a traitor to America or not.

The *strongest* candidates were the ones who had the most brutal fights in the primary. This is true on the other side as well - the 2016 primary was *brutal* for Republicans. I think a lot of people have forgotten how bad it was. They pulled out *all* the stops to prevent Trump, including overriding an entire state's votes to take a victory away from Trump. It didn't work, and Trump was all the stronger for it. Democrats, on the other hand, did their best to push Hillary through to her throne, despite her obvious flaws. And it tanked her in the general.\n\nThere's only one objective reading of this situation. Primary elections are a *good* thing, not a bad thing.

CNN\u2019s exit polls showed it paid off.\n\nChief among Trump\u2019s gains compared with his performance against Biden in 2020: Latino men. Trump won that cohort by 8 points, four years after losing them by 23 points. It\u2019s a result that showed his campaign\u2019s efforts to court those voters paid off \u2014 and that the late focus on a comedian mocking Puerto Rico at Trump\u2019s Madison Square Garden rally didn\u2019t cause the damage Harris\u2019 campaign hoped it would. The gains were concentrated most heavily among Latinos under age 65.\n\nTrump also made gains in key places among Black men, more than doubling his 2020 performance in North Carolina.\n\nOverall, the exit polls painted a picture of an electorate displeased with the state of the nation and its leadership.\n\nNearly three-fourths of voters said they were dissatisfied or angry with the way things are going in the United States, CNN\u2019s exit polls found. Trump won about three-fifths of those voters. Biden was deeply underwater, with 58% of voters saying they disapprove of his performance as president. Four in five of those voters backed Trump.\n\nHarris slipped compared with Biden\u2019s performance four years ago among young voters, independents, moderates and union households.\n\nVoters who said democracy was the most important issue overwhelmingly backed Harris, but Trump won those who identified the economy as most important by nearly the same margin.\n\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2024/11/06/politics/takeaways-election-day/index.html\n\nIt seems like the general attitude is people are disappointed in Biden and  Harris as a member of the administration was tied directly to it so people were just not enthused enough to actually go out and vote and people are depressed about the state of the nation and want radical change.

I was rooting for Beshear (and I still think he would have been the best choice) but now I'm glad that he didn't get picked. He has loads of potential and this would have messed up his career.

Nor did he know that North Korea has boots on the ground in Russia. This is tough because the Murdoch's and Fox withheld so much truth from viewers. As for those who attended rallies he spewed his violent depravity in their faces and they cheered and ate it up. I guess what I'm trying to say is that in general, the rally goers intentionally chose evil. But for Fox viewers, they seem to have stumbled in the darkness not knowing where they were. As for Fox's pundits such as Lara Ingram and Jessie Waters, they intentionally chose evil and intentionally chose to deceive viewers.",

I made this comment earlier which I\u2019ll copy and paste below but social media and bullshit information has done a fucking number on people.\n\n\u2018Reddit is just a small piece of this in the end.  Tons of people aren\u2019t on Reddit.  They get their information off of either the news and/or social media.  The latter is misinforming the living fuck out of people and it\u2019s having a ripple effect impacting all kinds of shit, not even just politics.  The news does this too, the extent depends on which news sources they watch specifically.\n\nBack to the topic of social media and people being terribly misinformed, (this is all anecdotal btw) I know some people in high up government positions who are seeing colleagues who should know better consuming all kinds of bullshit.  My friends have told me they\u2019re greatly concerned about the future of this country if this continues and it will.  The level of stupid shit some of our own officials are consuming is wild.\n\nI\u2019ve been to physical therapy off and on throughout my life and so I\u2019ve gotten kinda close with some PT\u2019s.  In recent years I\u2019ve heard crazy stories from therapists regarding growing amounts of people with health issues who think they\u2019re going to cure their problems with supplements or some other nonsense.  Some instances were people with conditions like diabetes where they eventually put themselves in dangerous situations or even got themselves killed!  My PT\u2019s were saying that while people have shown this behavior before, they have never seen it get this bad until recent years.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s people working in schools dealing with kids who are spewing nonsense as fact consuming tik tok\u2019s or whatever it is they watch.  There\u2019s stories like this everywhere and it\u2019s only getting worse.  I\u2019ve heard it from friends who are working in the education system, and there\u2019s tons of discussions about this online.\n\nThis problem is pretty fucking massive and the trolls and those who wish to push this BS are outnumbering those who aren\u2019t for this.  And I imagine there\u2019s a lot of people like myself who gave up on social media platforms like Facebook which probably helped feed into the problem in the end as the number of bullshitters stays strong while those would try to oppose them have dwindled cause they\u2019ve given up.\u2019",
         "Yup! When Biden dropped, I was really hesitant on Kamala and recalled her lackluster presidential run prior. When i watched the Kamala vs trump debate, my opinion officially was changed and I was reinvigorated. I saw how intelligent, concise, and effective her arguments were. You saw her years of prosecutor skills come out and you saw just how intelligent she really is. Meanwhile, Trump could barely put together a coherent sentence in that debate. They could ask Trump what is 1+1 and he\u2019d answer immigrants are ruining the country that was all he could put together in that debate. \n\nAfter that debate, I was convince that no sane person could watch the entirely of that debate and think \u201cyeah, that\u2019s my guy! He was so well spoken and coherent\u201d I was convinced that there is no way people can doubt Kamala now. \n\nThen the propaganda machine came into effect and i learned how wrong i was. Suddenly, you could easily tell you did and didn\u2019t watch the debate because people would just spout right wing talking points that were incredibly false and misleading, but no one cares because they clearly never watched the debate. People would say they both did bad (not true), they\u2019d say Trump dominated and was tough on immigration (laughably untrue), they\u2019d say Kamala couldn\u2019t produce a single policy (full of lies since she was very deliberate in naming policy goals while Trump famously said \u201cconcepts of a plan\u201d). They don\u2019t care that Trump doesn\u2019t have a plan, but they do care that they were falsely told that Kamala doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s all about the propaganda spin at the end of the day. Very few people are actually watching this themselves. That is a tough lesson i am learning after this election. \n\nIf i had a genie wish, I\u2019d wish that every person would be forced to watch that debate in its entirely without any newscaster or commentator giving it their spin. I just want people to see for themselves what Trump and Kamala are like in action, not a 10-second edited clip to make them look as good or as bad as they want.",

I support my parents, sending them several hundred dollars per month so I can keep them in their house b/c they made shit decisions in the past, yet they vote Republican, and they know who I vote for.  Liberals support Republicans all the fucking time, most or some of them know this, and they don't give a shit.\n\nEdit:  I should also add, I have to do this because their SS check isn't large enough for them to keep their home, while putting food on the table.  So they are 100% supported by socialism at this point.",

More importantly though, perhaps it would force red voters to at least admit that they either want to keep receiving welfare from blue states, or pretend it\u2019s not true and therefore it would also be ok to put an end to.",

At this point I have no idea what actually does.\n\nIt might just be that humans are innately motivated by fear and now the only way to actually win elections is fear mongering.

Also, to 25 him they need majority of his Cabinet to go along with that and there is no way there would be enough of them willing to do that.  Trump pits his people against each other and creates distrusted between them so there is no chance they would even trust each other enough to talk about it.",

There's no ethics either. It's all just a giant click bait factory now.\n\nI don't know about anybody here, but I'm done with being lied to. I had ad block on the entire time.

         "This is a recurring historical trend. Right wing socioeconomic policies (laissez-faire capitalism) lead to social dysfunction as more and more people either fall into poverty or fear doing so. The mainstream right can't win elections on these policies any more because they have become unpopular, but rather than change those it either allies or becomes the extremist right (authoritarian and reactionary), going all in on distractions and scapegoating.\n\nThis leaves the social liberals (pro-capitalist but not socially conservative) and the social democrats as the only democratic factions to counter them, but the former block most major re-distributive policies and even the most moderate moves towards a fairer society have to be fought over tooth and nail. This alliance (either as intra-party in a two party or as a coalition in multiparty systems) then fails to do enough to keep their voters on board, disillusionment sets in, voters stay home and the extremist right takes over.\n\nFortunately, it doesn't always completely run through this cycle, but it keeps happening. It has now happened to the USA and the best case scenario is that when those lukewarm Trump supporters are angry at not getting what they wanted out of this \"change\" (and they won't), they will still have the means to vote the government out. If not, then you're stuck until a revolution happens.\n\nArguing that more social democracy would have scared away voters is sort of pointless IMHO, because if that is true then you're doomed anyway. Unless you lower economic inequality through government policy, a descent into reactionary authoritarianism is inevitable because democracy can only work when people are more or less equal and capitalism left to itself will always concentrate wealth and power into fewer hands.",

Sure, there are other issues that nibble around the edges (LGBTQ, crime, the woman's right to choose, etc.) but ultimately the exit polls indicate that the economy decided this election. \n\nSo, it really had nothing to do with this \"Kamala wasn't liberal enough\" thing that Bernie and others on the far left on pushing. Biden certainly wasn't more liberal than Kamala and he won 300+ electoral votes just 4 years ago.

         "I just want to point out something to a lot of people that might not understand this. While this is the beginning of the next presidency, it is also the end of this storyline. The Republican Party is at a crossroads with itself and it splintering down the middle. One side you have moderate Republican who wants to move the country in a direction of conversation with Democrats and the other side you have the radical Republicans. The party is going to cannibalize itself. \n\nAs for the people that voted for the Republican Nominee, I want to point out a little thing that you might not have thought about. While you are all for deporting migrants, we need to remember that the economy will not stay afloat without those individuals. 1) Migrants make up only 18.6% of the labor jobs in this country. That is not a number that is hurting our workforce. 2) Migrant jobs include working on farms and construction sites as well as mines, factories, food preparation, cleaning, and child care. Here is where Republicans made their mistake.\n\nIf the deportation of migrants happens, the farms, construction sites, factories, mines, food preparation companies, etc. will have few things that will occur:\n\n1) **Getting rid the migrant workers will eventually cause these companies to close.** Why? These companies will be getting rid of their work force that is paid off the books. These companies have bult in paying migrants off the books that they would not be able to handle paying the same amount of people on the books. Result: Companies crash, farms in the Red States no longer function, prices of goods produced by the company skyrocket, people can't/won't buy their goods because they are too expensive, local economies crash, the Red States cannot function.\n\n2)  **The companies keep the workers but have to provide them with Green Card Status.** Why? They do not want to get rid of their labor but now they have to pay them a livable wage. Result: Green Card Status increases, the migrants become citizens, which means they vote, Red States will see shifts to Blue. \n\nSo what does that mean? Well, Republicans who felt that voting for the Republican Nominee would lower grocery costs, it won't. It will cause them to increase. Coupled with tariffs, getting rid of the CHIPS and Science Act, you're looking at being a lot worse off than you were the last four years.\n\nSo where does this go? The next four years will be an embarrassment, but Republicans will not be voted in as President for a long time after this. No one will be able to inherit the Republican Nominees cult because they have not been able to yet. The Red States will population because they will be moving to Blue States to feel protected.

         "\nI'm not so convinced that there is a \"working class\" to be abandoned or to have abandoned. As a purely economic measure there is a working class, but as an identifiable force they're as fractured as the Democratic party.\n\nFor the \"working class\" to have power whether amongst Republicans or Democrats they have to be able to look at other workers and see fellow travellers.\n\nI like Bernie and he's got a good message. He would be a much more influential force if he could convince an autoworker why he should support a barrista and why both should support a call center worker or a data operator ... and so on. If he did that the Democrats wouldn't have abandoned workers and workers wouldn't have abandoned Democrats - the Democrats would be a workers party. Or, even the Republican party.  They'd be a force.\n\nBut the reality is that our working class friends are as likely to say, \"I got mine now you get yours,\" up until the day when Musk fires them all, then they'll say they were abandoned.\n\nWorkers abandon workers and that's the reason why they don't have the political power they could have.",

         "Bernie is spot on with this and we can see how yhe Democratic party has been taking actions that have lead to the current situation we are in:\n\n     In 2016, many within the Democratic Party felt that the primary was unfairly tilted towards Hillary Clinton, who was historically and at the time unpopular. The Republicans, on the other hand, had a competitive primary and seemed to listen to their base.\n\n     During the general election, Trump and the GOP campaigned heavily in the Rust Belt, speaking to the concerns of the working class and promised to address them (even if it was a facade). Meanwhile, the Clinton campaign took these voters for granted, focusing on \u201cHer\u201d messaging and courting higher-income and college educated voters who didn\u2019t typically vote Democratic.\n\n     As the working class began leaving the Democratic Party, feeling ignored, they were often called racist or sexist for supporting Trump\u2014even if they were mainly looking for someone who acknowledged their economic struggles.\n\n     This persisted through Trump\u2019s presidency and into the 2020 election. Trump benefited from a strong economy pre-COVID, which was likely caused by Democratic policies under Obama. However, recency bias often effects the party in power, which helped Trump\u2019s appeal to some.\n\n     In 2020, the Democratic primary again felt tilted, with Biden as the perceived favorite. During the general election, Biden won over upper/middle-class and college educated voters, helped by the pressures around the pandemic. However, the GOP continued gaining support from the working class, minority groups and women.\n\n     Biden inherited a volatile economy due to the pandemic and faced resistance in Congress that limited his ability to pass policy. Those that did pass weren\u2019t seen as helpful or quick enough, so people new frustrated. Many recalled the relatively strong economy under Trump and compared it to their current situation.\n\n     In the 2024 primary, Biden chose to run again rather than passing the torch, and the Democratic Party blocked any real primary competition. While the GOP already knew and supported Trump as their candidate as he remained popular with their base. This was something Biden was struggling with. After a rough debate performance, Biden was replaced, not by any of the 2024 primary candidates, but by Kamala Harris, who had dropped out of the 2020 primary and was already viewed as part of an unpopular administration.\n\n     Harris ran a competitive campaign and tried to reach the working class. Many found her insincere, and the labeling of dissatisfied voters as racist, sexist or fascist continued. Trump gained even more working class support, including from minority groups and women. Harris struggled to motivate both the Democratic base and middle-class voters.\n\nWhile I skipped over some factors between elections (2022 midterms, international events, SCOTUS decisions, etc.), I believe these choices by the Democratic Party have driven voters towards the GOP.\n\nP.S. I believe Bernie was the Democratic Party's answer to the downfall of Neo liberalism, like Trump was for the GOP. The Dems just stopped him and the movement, where the GOP embraced Trump.\n\nTL;DR: The Democratic Party\u2019s strategy of prioritizing college educated and middle class voters has alienated the working class and non college educated voters. When these voters turned to Trump, they were often labeled as racist, sexist or fascist. They are now frustrated, feeling left behind economically and rejected by a party that once claimed to represent them. Additionally, the lack of real primaries (starting with Bernie Sanders) in the last three election cycles has left many Democratic supporters feeling disenfranchised.",

As a person in counseling grad school- it amazes me that people still fail to understand that human beings are emotional beings first, and not Vulcans. Very few of us can make reasonable choices when in a heated emotional state. The only way to reach angry, frustrated people (and I said the same thing to people policing BLM activists breaking windows) is to start by contacting the anger and pain. \n\nThat looks like this: your suffering is valid, this situation is super hard that you are in. \n\nThis is what the republicans do effectively, then once the emotions are validated, they blame the wrong people (immigrants, trans people etc) and claim to be able to fix it. \n\nThis is what democrats do: \u201cI don\u2019t understand what the big deal is, here\u2019s a series of facts explaining why your feelings are wrong.\u201d\n\nI mean it\u2019s literally the same dynamic that often gets men in trouble in close relationships.

And quite honestly the Democratic alliance with people like Mark Cuban is out of touch. \n\nIs it bizarre and irrational people fall for Trump\u2019s Everyman con and alliance with Elon Musk? Sure. But it\u2019s also entirely understandable people are angry and fed up with, yes, the death of the American dream, and it\u2019s very human to not be able to think rationally when upset and in the midst of real survival concerns. And if only Trump contacts their anger and creates space for it then he wins. When things reach a point like this, populism will win - and unfortunately if left wing populism of the FDR quality isn\u2019t available, what\u2019s left is right wing populism. \n\nThere is a way to contact and hold space for anger and allow it to transform into optimism but it has to start with contacting and validating the pain.",

You can argue what factors caused inflation to spike, but that is a fact. \n\n*Inflation* has been significantly curbed since the recent peak, but the increased *prices* in groceries and other household goods remain at elevated levels",
         "Yeah I am agreeing that some of the things are made up but that\u2019s what they got people to believe. Everyone\u2019s life sucks and they were speaking to that where the Harris campaign didn\u2019t do anything messaging wise on this front",

         "Wait and see what happens when all the migrants are gone. Who is going to go pick the produce for $1 an hour?",
         "If that\u2019s the case then the democrats failed in their messaging. It\u2019s as simple as that. They keep running to the right every single time. Tax cuts, small business incentives, lethal military, unilateral support for Israel, Trump 2016 border policy(making him up the ante to deportations). Progressive policies are popular simple as that and this election shows just that. Even though Trump won those policies still did well.",
         "Yeah, but that\u2019s the bar for Democrats because you\u2019re working with more educated group while trying to court less educated group. So you need a candidate who can satisfy both.\n\nBill Clinton also fit into the mold. He would\u2019ve been remembered as a good president if he could keep his privates in his pants. \n\nIronically that affected Hillary\u2019s political career, as her tolerating the affairs pretending everything is good made her look cold to the voters, someone who\u2019s married for politics not love. \n\nI wonder if it would\u2019ve helped if she was a bit more emotional with the press about the topic back then. Tears are cheap but effective. Could\u2019ve written narrative of a woman in love who was hurt but recovered to run the country. \n\nWhich is unfair but that\u2019s politics.",
         "As I said in comment above, it\u2019s unfair but that\u2019s what Democrat president needs in this era. Look at Clinton and Obama, and to smaller extent younger Biden. \n\nAnd look at Bush and Trump. \n\nThe requirements for each party stands out in my opinion. Dem presidents are well educated political elites who connect well with working class because they are good at figuring out what voters want. \n\nRepublican presidents are ones who connect with voters because they feel like an average person who made it to presidency.\n\nUnironically they represent their core voting blocks well.",

         "You mean the same way the democratic establishment was salivating at the prospect of Trump being the candidate in 2016? \n\nWe need to stop caring about how Republicans paint our candidates. They'll call them a communist gun-hating liberal no matter who we pick. Can we instead focus on getting someone who actually gets us excited to vote?",
         "Inflation was a global occurrence triggered by the Covid pandemic. In the United States, under the Biden administration, we successfully managed to reduce inflation, with the current rate standing at 2.4%.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that a decrease in inflation does not necessarily translate to lower prices. A situation of deflation would arise if prices were to decrease, which could potentially lead to more severe consequences that may be beyond our comprehension.",
         "It\u2019s as if someone cut taxes from companies, so they did the capitalist thing and put money back into their own pockets, bought back their own stock and raised prices on goods because people are gonna pay for the most essential products no matter the price\u00a0",
         "Made that point to my dad this past weekend and by his reaction, it was obvious he hadn't thought of that immediate downstream effect.\n\n\nAmericans, mostly, can't think one step ahead.",
         "People on the right don't vote based on policy. They vote based on feeling. Latinos voted for a guy who said he would deport their family members who came illegally. I watched several videos today of people saying thats fine, even if they have been here for 20-30 years. Could you imagine voting to deport your parent or grandparent?",
         "It has nothing to do with morals or American pride. Americans hate socialism. I understand this is a painful truth for socialists to hear, and I'm definitely not going to argue the merits for the umpteenth time. Just pointing out a fact.",
         "Even when it is an obvious step, which is extremely demoralizing.",
         "They also didn\u2019t mind the fact trump scouted out locations for a trump tower in Moscow in 1987 in the Soviet Union. I know it\u2019s not a honeymoon and just a potential business venture that would have given trump financial ties to the Soviet Union but still.",
         "Uh. I guarantee you *no one*, left, right, center, or Martian, harbors any suspicion that Trump is a socialist."

This means that the American people either voted for Trump, or didn't vote.\n\nWe can acknowledge this without being jerks from either direction. I know that's a huge ask, but it's the facts. Harris failed to mobilize more voters than Trump, end of sentence.\n\nWhile I find that to be a shame personally, it's also not a secret that the [Harris](https://www.politifact.com/personalities/kamala-harris/) campaign was legitimately dishonest at times compared to both the [Biden](https://www.politifact.com/personalities/joe-biden/) and [Clinton](https://www.politifact.com/personalities/hillary-clinton/) campaigns. It's been a pointed and continued downturn since the [Obama administration](https://www.politifact.com/personalities/barack-obama/) ended.\n\nWe have websites that track this for us. It's not really a contest. The Democratic party has factually been allowing itself to let the American people down for a decade or more when it comes to truth.\n\nDoes that mean that the Republican party has done better? No, absolutely not, but when [Trump](https://www.politifact.com/personalities/donald-trump/) goes out and says anything he wants like he has for 20+ years there's a difference in standards.\n\nThe problem is that the truth isn't relevant to Republican voters, and it is to Democratic voters. When both candidates are lying, there's no space for those who value honesty. Worse, there were multiple instances where Donald Trump said something normal/benign with context, and the Democratic party decided to actively promote it out of context to voters that they know fact-check. They shot themselves in the foot.\n\nWhen people on this site were talking about feeling an Obama-like Aura from Harris I knew the campaign was cooked. It just wasn't honest or comparable. People like Reagan, Obama, FDR, Roosevelt, etc come along once in a generation for a reason.\n\nTelling people that the Harris campaign was the same as the Obama campaign in terms of energy or hype or policy or etc isn't the same as it actually being that way, and unfortunately for America the polls firmly reflect that.\n\nShe was a candidate that the people didn't pick (and who they rejected in the prior election,) that people didn't resonate with, and who is a part of the current administration that is almost historically unpopular. Trump didn't win so much as the Democrats gave Americans very little reason to vote, let alone care.\n\nAnd so those who voted preferred to vote for Trump, and that's a shame. Trump shouldn't be who we want representing us, regardless of your personal politics.",

Prior to the election, Trump communicated a blank check to Netanyahu to do whatever he wants in Gaza.\n\nSo congratulations to these holdouts. Instead of voting for your less-than-ideal-candidate who was willing to give you a seat at the table to push this issue in the direction you want, you helped put someone in that very same position that will assuredly leave Palestine in a much worse situation than what you\u2019re upset about Kamala over.

It\u2019s not much, but it\u2019s what I can do. \n\nFor those that care, organic, Kosher, and Halal certifiers are not going to be affected as quickly as FDA. There is still oversight from those certifying bodies. There is additional layer of protection for those certified products.  \n\nBe safe out there, yall.\n\nETA a comment i posted as a reply but may help others:\n\nSo for Organic, Halal, and Kosher, to get the mark you have to comply with a set of standards that mirror the GMPs (Code of Federal regulations applicable to each industry). They require documentation, traceability of ingredients, and due to the requirement for manufacturers of ingredients to also be certified (organic specifically), site visits are also performed.\n\nFor organic, for example, once a year they audit our facilities and look at cleanliness and associated records. Making sure we have a recall plan, a food safety plan, that we are getting certificates of food safe conformity for packaging materials. They have to know WHO we are buying from, and they have to know that THAT vendor is being visited annually.\n\nAnd that\u2019s just organic. With Kosher it\u2019s the same deal, plus monthly random inspections. So a kosher organic product has 2 groups making sure I don\u2019t use sawdust as a food filler.\n\nDespite paying the certifier a fee, they are not easily swayed. Their reputation is on the line as a certifying body, so looking the other way on a requirement can be business suicide.\n\nYou know how often fda inspects food, cosmetic, or supplement facilities? Not annually, that\u2019s for sure. They rely on USDA to do the heavy lifting and are only CFR-required to routinely visit supplement manufacturers.\n\nThis is a brief rundown, let me know if you\u2019ve got questions.

         "Welcome back to the bad old days of 1905 when you're just as likely to die from a a simple bacterial infectionan as from poison in the food that you bought from your local store.\n\nBefore the establishment of the FDA in 1906, the food supply in the United States was largely unregulated, leading to widespread unsafe practices and contamination. Key issues included:\n\n1. Contaminants and Adulteration: Food producers often added harmful substances to increase weight, improve color, or extend shelf life. Common examples included adding lead-based dyes to candy, formaldehyde to milk, and borax as a preservative in meat. These chemicals were often toxic and had severe health effects on consumers.\n\n\n2. Spoilage and Lack of Sanitation: Without federal oversight, food production often lacked sanitary standards. Meatpacking plants, for example, were notoriously unhygienic, as famously described in Upton Sinclair\u2019s 1906 novel The Jungle. Food would often be contaminated with dirt, animal waste, and diseased meat, increasing the risk of illnesses.\n\n\n3. Mislabeling and Fraud: Many food products were mislabeled or falsely marketed. Companies made exaggerated or entirely false claims about their products, which misled consumers. Some products labeled as \u201cpure\u201d or \u201cnatural\u201d were anything but, and harmful additives were rarely disclosed.\n\n\n4. Milk and Meat Safety: Milk was often diluted with water and contaminated with bacteria due to improper handling and storage. Similarly, meat products were sometimes sourced from sick or diseased animals, contributing to outbreaks of foodborne illnesses.\n\n\n5. Absence of Food Standards: There were no uniform standards or labeling requirements, so consumers had little way to know the quality or safety of the products they bought.\n\n\n\nThese dangerous practices led to a demand for regulation, culminating in the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906, which later evolved into the FDA. The Act established basic standards, banned certain harmful additives, and introduced labeling requirements to protect public health and trust in the food supply.",

If minorities are now a major backer of trump what does the next 4 years look like? Does he change his rhetoric a little bit or do they keep going the direction it seems and he loses all support in 4 years.\n\n  \nI dont like saying it but as a middle age straight white dude that voted Harris I don't think the Ds can run anyone but a youngish normal straight white guy for the next 20+ years. It's not what I think is right but just looking at how this went and how the 2016 election went I think it's fair to say we are not ready for a woman. It's time to play it safe even if that means somethings taking a back seat for awhile. Shut up about any policies that don't mention the economy and housing. That's what people care about.

There are plenty of examples of latino men being deported over the last two decades and being unable to re-enter the country and prove their citizenship and being stuck in legal limbo in Mexico or wherever.

You kind of have to placate peoples' egos.\n\nThere's also an inclusive level of empowerment men need to feel.  We've been promoting a women's power movement for a long time, but this usually comes at the expense of men instead of including them.  Part of that is saying you can maintain your masculinity while not doing things that are toxic.\n\nThis isn't to dismiss problems of a patriarchal society.  There's some level of personal responsibility here that we can't account for or solve without their own innate desire.\n\nYou also need to deprogram some of things they've already learned, which might be the hardest part.  Sell that the grifters don't actually care about you, they only care about themselves and exploiting your fear and concerns for their personal financial gain.\n\nA dialogue is the big one, though, without lashing out against them.

I'm not stupid enough to let that influence all my political opinions but I also don't 100% blame people who have had their politics informed by that kind of stuff. I think a lot of people probably stopped reading this comment after that first sentence and think I'm some kind of incel just for trying to get myself into these young men's mindset, which gets to the rest of your comment.\n\nI'm not trying to say those women don't have very legitimate concerns, or that they need to prioritize men's feelings over their own especially considering what just happened yesterday, but I also think the past decade or so has seen a ramping up of the battle of the sexes, and its understandable that young men will trend towards the side that is pandering to them. \n\nIMO we need to move away from identity politics and shift towards economic populism, liberals have entirely co-opted aspects of progressive language and none of the policies that will impact people, and it has led to 2 terms of Trump.

Oh but then took away every tool he had to change anything, and then blamed him for it and call him mid now. \n\nBeing a politician for the left is thankless work. Your supporters only care when shit hits the fan. You can have the best egghead's in the world make plans to fix their problems, and it still all boils down to vibes and wedge issues. This is a straight up indictment of the left in America. For what it's worth, I did my part. But now I won't accept any blame for it either. My conscious is clean, very clear. \n\nLooks like I won't be going outside as much anymore. Y'all all crazy (I don't mean you poster, just saying in general)",
         "Just become politically unaware like I plan to. I\u2019ll still vote democrat in every election, educate myself on the platforms etc when the elections loom, but hanging on every thing Trump does or doesn\u2019t do on a daily/weekly basis is something nobody will be able to convince me is worth it. I spent 4 years after 2016 closely following him breaking laws because I was always anticipating the justice he would receive for it. What is the point in tuning into the threads and daily news now? What will you get out of regularly following what this man is doing in office besides extreme despair and angst? I\u2019d say tune it out just like the millions of non-voters who couldn\u2019t give less of a fuck, live a less stressful life, vote democrat when the time comes and hope for the best.",

If someone writes a news article he doesn't like, he'll probably find a way to imprison them as an \"official act.\"\n\nAs I read and re-read my comments before posting them, sometimes I stop and ask myself if I'm being an alarmist.

I've dedicated most of my life to working to make our country and the world a better place.\n\nThis election showed me that the country just doesn't care or want what I have to offer anymore.  I don't think we are that stupid as a people that we don't know what just happened--we threw our democracy in the garbage bin because the price of eggs was too high.  I suppose the US had a pretty average run as far as the rise and fall of empires goes--will never compare to the Egyptian, Greek, Roman or British Empires, but we had a 250 year run.  Its just a shame that we willingly gave it all away for such stupid reasons.\n\nThe rest of the free world now thinks we are a complete joke.  For 9 years they have been wondering what has been happening to us, now they can be certain that we are a nation of fools.  MAGA hat-wearing, fat, stupid, hate-filled fools that will sell out their country because they think they pay too much for a gallon of milk.\n\n  \nI quit.  I'm leaving teaching, packing up my family and leaving the country that I loved and worked so hard to improve.  I'm profoundly sad about this decision, but fortunately we have enough money and the means to go live somewhere else and renounce our ties to the US.  I figure its time to go since I am so disgusted with my country, and they will likely be coming for me as an \"enemy within\" soon anyway.\n\nThe US absolutely deserves what is coming.  Watch over the next couple of years as people lose their health care, women are dying in parking lots as they bleed out from a lack of care, the military breaks down doors to arrest enemies, 11 million people are rounded up and deported, and public education sinks to the nether regions.  Watch as prices soar even more with tariffs, as Russia annexes Ukraine (then Poland and Moldova and others), watch us pull out of NATO and align with Russia.

         "*For anyone who can't read it...*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**America Deserves Donald Trump. The World Doesn\u2019t.**\n\nThe president-elect has no philosophy or policy, and his incoherence about global relations is not feigned.\n\nNovember 6, 2024 at 8:25 AM EST\n\nBy Andreas Kluth\n\n\nIt\u2019s his world now.\n\nEvery country gets the government it deserves, it has been said, and America now gets a second administration led by Donald Trump. But the rest of the world did not vote in the US election. Does it deserve what comes next?\n\nAnd what exactly is that? The planet\u2019s most important relationship is arguably that between the world as a whole and its most powerful nation, even if it\u2019s no longer a superpower, hyperpower or \u201chegemon.\u201d That relationship, much more so than in Trump\u2019s first term, is now in flux, adrift, undefined.\n\nTrump campaigned on a vacuous premise that he will deliver peace through \u201cstrength\u201d without ever spelling out the sources or objectives of that strength. When he was president, he has bragged, \u201cWe didn\u2019t have countries fighting each other, they wouldn\u2019t have done it without my permission.\u201d What a joke.\n\nCome January, we\u2019ll find out if Trump\u2019s fellow strongmen ask for permission from his White House as they make their moves in geopolitics. Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin, with his KGB-trained mind, has always known how to flatter and manipulate Trump, and that\u2019s what worries Ukraine. China\u2019s Xi Jinping has taken note of Trump\u2019s inconsistent statements about Taiwan, and is ready to wage the trade war that Trump promises to launch.\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un already knows Trump from three summits and a brief exchange of \u201clove letters\u201d; as a direct result of that failed flirtation, he went full-bore in building nukes and missiles to threaten South Korea, Japan and the US. The mullahs in Iran probably do fear Trump \u2014 but they may now follow North Korea\u2019s strategy of self-protection with nuclear weapons.\n\nAmerica\u2019s allies, meanwhile, have no idea what\u2019s coming but fear the worst. Trump has, after all, threatened to pull out of NATO and to abandon partners if they don\u2019t buy enough chips or cars or steel from the US. Not least, anybody who cares about international law and the United Nations has reason to despair: Trump doesn\u2019t understand the UN as an institution or an idea, and he disdains what he doesn\u2019t understand.\n\nIt\u2019s become de rigueur among Washington\u2019s foreign-policy \u201cblob\u201d to affix \u201cisms\u201d to Trump\u2019s foreign-policy style, like MAGA buttons to lapels. He\u2019s a nationalist, they say, or an isolationist, mercantilist, realist, unilateralist, and so forth. All partially true \u2014 and all beside the point.\n\n\nThe person who has best captured the man\u2019s worldview is John Bolton, a notorious hawk who did a stint as Trump\u2019s national security adviser. The critical point is that Trump has \u201cneither philosophy nor policies,\u201d Bolton says. Trump\u2019s decisions on national security are entirely transactional, he writes, spread on the map like \u201can archipelago of dots, unconnected by chords of logic, salience or results.\u201d\n\nThe optimistic spin on Trump\u2019s approach is that it\u2019s a new and amped version of the \u201cmadman theory\u201d that was once attributed to Richard Nixon (although Machiavelli long ago suggested that it can indeed be a \u201cwise thing to simulate madness\u201d). By that logic, America\u2019s foes and friends alike will be docile out of sheer fear: What might this man do, with or without a nuclear button?\n\nBut the madman theory \u2014 never properly elaborated or tested \u2014 assumes a leader who has a compass and a mental map, and feigns occasional derangement tactically to navigate to his strategic destination. Trump has neither compass nor map. If his foreign policy seems incoherent bordering on mad, he may not be feigning. America could actually find itself adrift in his archipelago of dots, also called the world.",
         "\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 Today, there is no \u201cthey,\u201d only \u201cwe.\u201d We cling to that illusion of division like it\u2019s the last life raft, pretending we\u2019re not all slowly sinking into the same sea of chaos. Aren\u2019t we supposed to be Americans? Or is that just something we slap on the Fourth of July and forget about once the fireworks are over? As author and activist Arundhati Roy put it, \u201cThe war is not over; it is not even beginning; we are all in it.\u201d (Roy, Field Notes on Democracy, 2008). It\u2019s hard to pretend we\u2019re separate when we\u2019re all in the same sinking boat.\n\nAt some point, we sold our future for pocket change\u2014sacrificing any long-term hope for the shallow comfort of a few extra dollars today. A cheaper tank of gas, a little tax break, maybe even a handful of crumbs to make us feel like we\u2019ve won. And yet, most don\u2019t see how deep Project 2025 and those \u201cinnocent\u201d tariffs will cut into their lives. We\u2019ve become a nation so wrapped up in our own smugness, we\u2019re too distracted to notice the slow-motion disaster heading straight for us. As journalist Chris Hedges said, \u201cWe are a society that is on the edge of ruin, and the people are too distracted by the drama to notice.\u201d (Hedges, America: The Farewell Tour, 2018). The kicker? The ones who cheered it all on are going to be the first ones to feel the sting.\n\nIf this is MAGA\u2019s promised land, then sure\u2014bring on those falling prices, the affordable gas, the groceries that magically cost less. But my gut tells me that\u2019s about as likely as pigs flying. The idea that one person can \u201csave the economy\u201d while conveniently ignoring the rest of the world is almost adorable\u2014like watching a toddler believe that closing their eyes means they\u2019re invisible. As economist Joseph Stiglitz aptly noted, \u201cMarkets are global, and the idea that a single nation can somehow insulate itself from global forces is delusional.\u201d (Stiglitz, Globalization and Its Discontents Revisited, 2017).\n\nWhen the reckoning comes, at least we\u2019ll have the privilege of saying, \u201cwe told you so.\u201d Not that it\u2019ll make a difference. I can already hear the chorus of MAGA voices scrambling to point the finger at everyone else, even though they\u2019ve got the Senate, House, Supreme Court, and Presidency locked down. Watching them contort themselves to blame \u201cthe others\u201d when they\u2019re the only ones with their hands on the wheel will be an impressive spectacle\u2014if it weren\u2019t so painfully predictable. As political commentator Thomas Frank observed, \u201cBlaming the elites is a convenient way of not facing the reality that we, as a society, are complicit in this mess.\u201d (Frank, Listen, Liberal, 2016).\n\nThis country\u2019s moral compass is so broken, it\u2019s practically a modern art piece. We\u2019re hanging on by a thread, and any hope of a miraculous comeback feels like a bad joke. Whatever storm is coming, we rolled out the welcome mat. We earned it\u2014every dark, twisted moment of it. As historian Howard Zinn warned, \u201cThe problem is not that we are too few, but that we are too few who are willing to stand up.\u201d (Zinn, A People\u2019s History of the United States, 1980).  \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8",

Also nobody knows what a tariff is? So people just trust what Trump says a tariff is?

Or they simply don't care as long as he punishes people they hate? Or simply it's the \"leopards eating people eating's faces\" joke all over again?\n\nNot even after project 2025, the 2 impeachments, the idiots that support him, or the enormous number of people, both celebrities and Republicans AND HIS OWN CHOSEN STAFF that endorsed Kamalla?\n\nMan...i begin to think that the only way...to put y'all out of your misery...would have been if someone actually managed to assassinate Trump, like.....it's a cult, it's just a cult. \n\nThe only conceivable way i see it now...would be if Trump just dies of a heart attack or something because of his old age...78-82 he'd be.... then Vance just is so incapable he somehow destroyes everything.\n\nEither that or Trump brings about the Next Great Depression and you guys actually start a revolution. \n\nYes, that's just how bad it looks from out here, i may be wrong, after all...his first term was simply bad and many people exaggerated, maybe so do i now, but really, i think ...nah..i know...this will end very badly for a lot of people.

There is talk of Michael Flynn having a prominent role in the next Trump administration. He is a man with extreme views. \n\n\nWill the Trump administration be constrained by the legal system?

The majority of voters don't care about much, but the things they do care about are owned by a select few Oligarchs, and those Oligarchs (which is what they are, Billionaires here are basically just the whitewashed name we use for Oligarchs in America) knew that Trump in the White House is best for their business. And being as they own all the spaces, the outlets, in which his shortcomings could be understood and metabolized, they've basically made sure to transform those things into... nothing.\n\nThe truth of his failings, his shortcomings, his ugliness - don't matter. Not in education-light, regulation-free, repercussion-zero spaces owned by billionaires that we all think we need to live in. The only thing that matters is whether they can be used to rub your nose in shit later, and that's easy enough to do, and that feels great in the spaces they own. The only thing that matters is feeling good in these spaces, living transitory moment-to-moment, feeling spitefully wonderful, knowing someone who \"thinks they're better than you\" isn't better than you, because the Oligarchs had the better brand, and you bought it, and you won.\n\nDemocracy's last breath was a belch in favor of Oligarchy. It doesn't matter what figurehead is in charge - clearly, this figurehead almost got shot and the people who just gave him the popular vote stopped caring that he got shot at in less than a week. All that matters is that we want to win with the Billionaires. We want the Billionaires to be our friends, and to be reassured that we could be them one day. We want to be owned by the Billionaires. We already are.",

I tried my best pitch how harris isn't only not a alternate non-evil option, but why she is a better shot for long term Palestine statehood. Nothing, lots of apathy, frustration, anger, especially Arab men, women at least would give me the 60 seconds to speak. I am very angry at this community and anyone who didn't vote Harris, period. It hurts extra when you have culture similarities and they don't trust you. But let me tell you, some or a lot of these people know a friend, family member, or friends friend that has been affected by israels atrocities in Gaza and Lebanon.

I was shocked at how quickly and affordably my relatives were able to get permitting and build in Texas compared to here.\n\nWe also have a lot of big corporations moving out of state, because our taxes are high, our wages are high and the added regulation makes it an expensive state to do business in. Which then leads to a lot of Californian's losing their jobs or having to move when the companies do.\n\nThe insurance market is fucked (I know it is everywhere.) but the regulations and caps on increases that CA has put on insurers have made a ton of companies just pull out of the state completely. \n\nThe entertainment industry, which I am a part of, is running away from the state because it is cheaper to film elsewhere. \n\nI'm far from a Republican and Trump is personally reprehensible, but if we really want to offer a good alternative, we need to take a good long look in the mirror and acknowledge that just going wholesale into liberal policies hasn't been working either.",

Except for her gender and race...\n\nAnd just anecdotally. People will do anything to mental gymnastics away sexism. A lot of guys straight up get offended when you imply women have problems in this country? It's crazy. I guess they see it as the suffering olympics. For example I'll talk about how women have worse outcomes in medicine, how doctors STATISTICALLY believe women less often... and men will deny doctors have a problem. Even though the statistics prove there is sexism in medicine. They don't want to believe it. They say \"well I had a doctor dismiss me once, so it's not a gender thing.\" Not understanding what \"statistically more likely\" means. It's frustrating. Sexism is real and we can't even talk about it half the time because so many people will make 5000 excuses before considering hey yeah, maybe there's enough sexist people in the US to make a difference in the election?",

And traditionally conservative values had hurt those two demos (drug war for blacks and things like \"don't ask, don't tell\" for gay folks). So the democratic party could build a platform around expansion of rights for these traditionally shafted groups. And certainly the working class (as opposed to the capital class) has an overrepresentation of various minority groups compared to white folks.\n\nGlobally, the cultures that produce brown/latino people aren't creating them from a society where brown/non-white people are the minority. They don't have that same mentality of being \"the minority\". In many cases in many countries, everyone has the same skin colour, etc. It's more of a social/economic class distinction in those cases (poor vs rich). So coming to America, they don't have the same concerns as minority voters who grew up where they were NOT the default, like black folks in America. And this mentality can transfer through at least a couple of generations due to proximity to those previous views from parents and grandparents.\n\nI don't think Rs would have a larger percentage of the black vote if they came off less racist because the minority psyche is present for black folks in America. But certainly we've now seen that cultures who don't share that same history of struggling against the default \"white culture\" also might not share the same fears of oppression. And might prioritize other concerns over civil rights.\n\nI predict that the only way to build a coalition that can attract minorities and white folks together (assuming that's the desired goal) is to appeal to the economic disparity and wealth inequality between rich and poor, and show that the real threat to democracy, free markets, and free speech is actually the wealthy \"oligarchy-like\" group, not immigrants or minorities.",

         ". Hopefully they stop relying on abortion to flip white women to the party\n\nDumb ass Democrats clung on to abortion like idiots when the writing on the wall was clear it's the economy stupid. \n\nFurthermore states like FLA an MO have demonstrated they can vote for trump while supporting abortion through state level referendums. \n\nFor example FLAs got to 58npercent of a needed 60 to overturn the abortion ban there. And Missouri literally succeeded. \n\nLike trump said, abortion is not the firebrand issue the Dems thought\n\nAnd the vote shows that white women can vote based on their pocketbokk and still support abortion access....further trump said NO National Ban and return the issue to states to decide. As he predicted and I mention some were more liberal than we assumed \n\n\nThen as a black man I think how in our circles we talk about reparations. The say No reparations the best I can do for you is abortion.  Abortion just isn't the big issue\n\n\n2. The disregard for the Palestine issue. No explanation needed\n\n3. No plan for migrants. Spends years calling trump racist and ignore calls tomshut down border only to have Biden do it in the last half of 24. Signalling republicans were right all along. \n\n4.  Then I think of young men. When I went to college in 2013, all that rape culture, toxic masculinity white privilege stuff was just coming out and we found it a little weird then too. Ten years later, kids who grew up with it from their toddler years to now are over it . Manospnere people and Rogan not feeling it. Young men went trump \n\n5. Latinos didn't care about trump attacks on migrants. The ones who can vote are already citizens \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udfff\u200d\u2642\ufe0f. Why would they care about people who \"skipped the line\"\n\n6.. I could go on but this election effort from Dems just seems incompetent. \n\nI was poised to see trump lose popular but he shellacked her. This is a clear mandate. As a Kamala voter, I support Trump's win and hope he does well to help us all do better. His tone is victory speech was presidential and no I don't think he's gonna be a dictator.

You can claim that American voters make a bad choice, but the whole point of democracy is that they have the freedom to do so.\n\nHeck, Trump is going to be in office for 4 more years, and that is it.

Instead of being shocked at the results, direct anger at the process. Get mad at the messaging.\n\nAnd then look at what comes next.\n\nIn America, there are always local races - the birthplace of succession. The Democrats need to build a continuation plan. And people need to take stock of themselves - like, really take stock - to determine if the changes in healthcare, in education, in family unification, and everything else coming up, are what they want forever.\n\nAnd while partisan politics are generally taboo, conversations need to be made about policy-politics. *Saying* that the democrats support choice, for example, won't fly. But conversations about someone dying because their embryo implanted in the wrong spot and wasn't dead enough for the pregnant person to be saved needs to be.\n\nSome asshole once asked a fair question: \"Where am I, Nancy?\". But he also asked another fair question: *are you better off today than you were four years ago*. Let your loved ones and the ones you hold close every chance to contemplate that answer for themselves fully and completely in four years. Let them consider the question when their local schools start shutting down, or when another tragedy strikes with no action. When they're suddenly paying to subsidize a 10%-100% tariff, or when they're forcibly separated from their partners or their kids for not absolutely fitting the nuclear family mold, check in with them. Don't ask them if it would have happened under Biden or Harris, but observe it: *Gosh, I guess Trump's plan really didn't work out for us!*",

Mark Cuban and bill gates aren\u2019t afraid of us. They will not side with Trump to put you in prison.\n\n2. There is an opposition party. Yes democratcs suck but they are an actual opposition party. Germany had no such thing. \n\n3. Trump will start a recession with his Tariffs. In contrast hitler came to power at the peak of the Great Depression. The economy had nowhere for him to go but up. The recession will put trumps approval at an all time low making it difficult for him to carry out the worst of his agenda. \n\n4. We have a federal system.

There's a clear disconnect between the 'economy' and people's actual every day spending.

         "To which i say: what should democrats have done, really? \n\nLook at immigration, for example. When popular opinion shifted, democrats in Congress changed their positions as well and worked together with Senstor Lankford to produce border legislation, which Trump killed. Democrats cared, they tried, and republicans killed their own bill. And immigration was the second biggest issue for voters that election. \n\nThe main issue was the economy. Sure, Biden / Harris had to struggle with slow growth due to the pandemic. They solved that issue faster than any other nation on the world, outpacing China for the first time in decades. So in macro economic terms, they have been very good. The infrastructure bill especially helped where help was needed most, which coincidentally helped red states more than blue states financially. So democrats really did try to help all Americans.\n\nNow, inflation was not really inflation, but an energy price hike caused deliberately by OPEC from March 2021, and of course the Russian invasion of Ukraine and disrupted energy supply lines around the globe - which is why the entire world suffered significantly from it. Biden with the IRA increased oil production and also solved the issue faster than any other nation. Wages didn\u2019t outpace inflation though, which surely is a problem - but i really can\u2019t see or say that the dems didn\u2019t try anything they could\u2019ve done.",

Don\u2019t get me wrong, rampant inflation is nothing good, but it neither happened because of Bidens admin (but by external factors) nor did they fail to address it. So inflation comes down to bad communication on Harris oder and that no media outlet called Trump out for his insane economic bullshit.\n\n>> a rise in crime\n\nCrime rates fell continuously though, so that\u2019s more of a feeling than reality.\n\n>> a border crisis\n\nThat democrats wanted to solve, Trump refused to do and no one cared. \n\nBesides the massive strategic failures (which, don\u2019t get me wrong, are fucking bad), the rest is more or less not really true in the way it\u2019s often get depicted and how media portraits that.

Its creation essentially means that from now on it will be NATO itself, rather than its biggest contributor the United States, that will coordinate training Ukrainian troops and providing military equipment. \n\n> The Group of 7 \u2013 which unites the United States, Germany, France, the UK, Italy, Canada and Japan \u2013 finalised a $50 billion long-term loan to Ukraine that would be funded largely by the interest on frozen Russian assets in Europe.  \n\n> Outgoing US President Joe Biden has backed up his European allies by pre-empting the potential risk of a US withdrawal from the deal should Trump be re-elected by making sure the $20 billion US contribution will start becoming available by the end of the year. Congress has approved five bills on Ukraine assistance since the start of the war worth $175 billion, with $106 billion going directly to the government of Ukraine. At a news conference in Riga in mid-October, James O\u2019Brien, the assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian Affairs, said that Biden will be \u201cemptying out\u201d the funds the US Congress has earmarked for Ukraine before the end of his term. \n\n\n> Although it is not possible for a US president to unilaterally pull the country out of NATO \u2013 Congress last year passed a law that such a decision needs Senate approval \u2013 Trump\u2019s threat still remains very real as he calls the Alliance's golden rule on mutual defence into question.\n\nTL;DR NATO and the Biden Administration have been formulating a contingency plan that empties out current US funding for Ukraine, while transitioning responsibilities to European powers, who are funding it with frozen Russian assets.",

I think the mass majority of humans will die and civilization as we know it will definitely collapse, but there will be livable places in the far north/south for centuries still. Mass agriculture will definitely be destroyed as the world's breadbaskets become deserts or floodplains, but crops for individual families and communities will still grow in pockets where methane release hasn't poisoned the soil. Once all industry is killed, over the next thousand years or so the warming will decelerate until we reach a new equilibrium. It'll definitely be a mass extinction event on the level of the dinosaurs, but some life on Earth will definitely survive, and humanity has a chance to be among them.\n\nMaybe it'll even be kind of fun, like the end of Wall-E. I mean, not for us, just for the handful of people that survive. And unfortunately we will be eating and shitting microplastics for as long as the planet exists regardless.",
         "No this is not what\u2019s going to happen. \n\nThere will be more food scarcity, certain areas of the world will become uninhabitable and coastal cities are going to be absolutely fucked.\n\nBut billionaires will not be in doomsday bunkers and certainly will not be starving because even worst case consensus predictions do not see this outcome, and the average first worlder will still have access to food. \n\nUnfortunately the worst of these impacts will hit the third world and ironically the least polluting countries but most of the first world is probably going to be okay with minimal changes as fucked as that is to say.

Human civilization will remain and we will not all starve in the 2050\u2019s.\n\nAlso grocery prices being high isn\u2019t due to climate change. That\u2019s due to rampant inflation of the last 2 years. Which has slowed.

         "Article:\n\n Donald Trumps has won the election, and Republicans are now comfortable openly admitting that Project 2025 was the plan all along. \n\nThe draconian policy package prepared by The Heritage Foundation in preparation for a second Trump administration was so extremist that in the final months of the campaign the former president took great pains to publicly distance himself from the project. Its contents, which include a broad expansion of executive powers; a de facto national abortion ban, increased restrictions on contraception; brutal policies against undocumented migrants; and the elimination of several federal agencies (including the Department of Education), didn\u2019t sit well with prospective voters.\n\nTrump feigned ignorance of the plan, despite his close ties to those involved in crafting it, while Democrats did all they could to warn about the conservative blueprint for a second Trump term.\n\nSure enough, less than 24 hours after the election was called for Trump, his allies, advisers, and prominent supporters were celebrating the now-open road to Project 2025\u2019s implementation. \n\nOn Wednesday, former Trump adviser Steve Bannon \u2014 who just weeks ago completed a four-month prison sentence on a contempt of Congress conviction \u2014- lauded Christian Nationalist Matt Walsh, a commentator at The Daily Wire, on his War Room broadcast. \n\nWalsh had written on X, formerly Twitter: \u201cNow that the election is over I think we can finally say that yeah actually Project 2025 is the agenda. Lol\u201d \n\n\u201cMatt Walsh, I think, is a very smart and funny guy,\u201d Bannon said. \u201cPut that everywhere,\u201d he added, with instructions to his staff to promote the post on his social media.\n\nRight-wing podcast Benny Johnson also gloated about the project. \u201cIt is my honor to inform you all that Project 2025 was real the whole time,\u201d he wrote. \n\n\tIn a separate post, Tarrant County GOP Chair Bo French wrote, \u201cSo can we admit now that we are going to implement Project 2025?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\tRegardless of whether Trump explicitly endorses Project 2025 as a guide for his second administration, the overlap in its proposals, staff, and goals means the two are inextricably linked.\u00a0 Republicans just don\u2019t have to pretend anymore.",

When they lost 2 years of planting and exports dropped significantly because of the black sea blockade, it caused all grain prices to increase. There is no substitute for that other than higher prices since crops are planted a year in advance. \n\nb. Transportation costs have also gone up because the world is trying to punish Russia and not buying their oil; This means that the only place to get excess production has been the US as OPEC maintains its production cuts. So while everyone says 'drill baby drill', all that does is send more oil to Europe and other places and wont really bring down prices in the US.\n\nThe only cure for either of these is demand destruction, which means you let them raise prices to the point where people just stop buying it. Thats the only way companies lower prices. Though normally they make the serving smaller and 'roll back' the price to see if that spurs demand, before offering more per bag and then finally cheaper prices. \n\nAs for household debt, its the highest level its been in a long time.

The idea that this incoming administration is going to adhere to some vague rules or laws is just laughable at this point. The supreme court has already given him carte blanche.

We need to restrict the border so we can get the process sorted out, illegal\u00a0immigration has increased which only makes the process even more difficult & puts a strain on social services. Biden\u00a0signed an EO to tighten the border earlier this year; Canada & some European countries are also cutting down on immigration because it truly is an issue, not just \u201cthey took err jobs\u201d shit. This would also help tame the fentanyl epidemic that is plaguing our country, I don\u2019t know anyone that hasn\u2019t lost someone to fentanyl & it\u2019s a contributing factor to poverty and homelessness. China manufactures it then the cartels smuggle it through the southern border, which brings me to 2.\n\n2: We\u2019re in an economic war with China; they have tariffs on US goods, they commit massive amounts of industrial espionage & IP theft to weaken US business interests. Biden imposed tariffs on China, Kamala campaigned for tariffs also. The number I\u2019ve read for Trump is 60%.\u00a0\n\n6: In 2014 only 3 of 30 countries were in compliance with the 2% of GDP agreement, they addressed it and agreed to all be at 2% within a decade. In 2023 it was only 11 of 30 & I believe this year it\u2019ll be around 20 of 30. The threat to pull from NATO seemed to be an ultimatum for countries to actually follow through on what they agreed upon & if those agreements are met then the issue is moot.\u00a0\n\n11: I don\u2019t necessarily agree with this, just wanted to comment on it.

Instead, they relied on America and didn't meet the requirements at all. Now that they might need us and our Big Bad Military and suddenly the cash starts coming out. They only help us when they need us. Frankly, why should we defend countries that can't do what they are supposed to unless the Sword of Damocles is above them? While we more than fulfill our side. Just look at what we gave Ukraine. Why is it always US who has to pay pay pay when our so called allies can barely do the same? \n\n  \nWhat I expect is that if we are to remain in NATO, they better meet the 2%, and if that price rises to 5%, or even more? Fine. Call it backpay. If you want our help and protection, sorry, but you got to pay. If we're going to make enemies with foreign superpowers, meeting the bare minimum requirements should be expected at ALL times, not just when Russia starts getting a little greedy. It's an alliance. Or it's supposed to be. Expect we're meeting our end of the requirement, and for the last ten years until now, most NATO countries simply haven't done the same.

Frankly, why should we defend countries that can't do what they are supposed to unless the Sword of Damocles is above them. While we more than fulfill our side. Just look at what we gave Ukraine. Why is it always US who has to pay pay pay when our so called allies can barely do the same? It just annoys me, to say the least.",

Healthcare providers are commonly taught to speak to patients in a similar fashion (and all patient handouts should also be at a grade-school level difficulty).\n\nSimply using concepts that are so foundationally simple is enough. But, imo, the key is to repeat, repeat, repeat, repeat. Can you name something democrats have said that resonated like these: \"build a wall (Mexico pay for it); drill baby drill; no tax on tips; stop the invasion; bring your energy prices down by half; close the border; have to come legally; energy independent.\n\nYou get the idea",

         "The USA benefits hugely from being a net exporter of national security. I don't mean hardware, but rather peace and deterrence benefits for our allies. This makes the USA an extremely safe investment, contributing to the massive strength of the US economy, US asset markets, and the US dollar being the global reserve currency.\n\n\nThe idea behind US military alliances in general is that the USA as the senior partner makes the largest investments and has the most influence over each of their allies individually. This means that they have to play by the rules set by the US, or risk being cast out in their own. The US is at the head of a decentralized machine that is much larger than they could afford to build themselves.\n\n\nIt's great that NATO allies are investing more in their own defense in line with their commitments, but this does not necessarily benefit the USA if the EU collectively\u00a0 becomes a true military equal to the USA. The reduced demand from allies for imported national security will correspondingly reduce US influence over global economic affairs, which will reduce US economic growth in the long term.",
         ">Just look at what we gave Ukraine. Why is it always US who has to pay pay pay when our so called allies can barely do the same? It just annoys me, to say the least.\n\nThe EU countries have given Ukraine more aid than the US. It sometimes seems like less because their contributions are split between EU contributions and individual contributions.",

         "He also has a very doxable reddit profile. This guy's a fucking idiot.",
         "Get real? you are the lunatic ranting about a guaranteed Nuclear war.",
         "You're absolutely not wrong. Trump won because he talked about issues that every American resonated with, such as economic struggles. However, the people that actually believed him have no idea how things like tariffs work in the first place. They hear \"I'm putting tariffs on china\" and think it's good.",
         "Things aren\u2019t that simple. Believe me I want to see Ukraine win and absolutely love watching Russia get embarrassed but we have to recognize that everything has its limits and we can\u2019t do this forever",
         "That\u2019s not how that works. Biden can commit crimes but can\u2019t legislate unilaterally.",
         "He doesn't have to do that either. Any executive order can simply be reversed with another executive order.",
         "I understand that, I do, but I don't think America leaving NATO would be a long term thing. The fact of the matter is that those European countries are truly de-fanged. Who will they turn to? China? I don't think anyone but us. Their military is just simply too weak. Our influence is already there. Hashing out better conditions and stipulations once they realize how big the world is without us there to protect them would be a good reality check.",
         "I wasn't referring to the EU giving Ukraine aid, but meeting their benchmarks in regard to the US. I should have been more clear.",
         "Yup. Take away is talking in terms of a 3rd grader is much more important than truth and facts. Folks just want to feel connected with, and frankly, our folks are just plain uneducated.",
         "> Things aren\u2019t that simple.\n\nOf course it's that simple.  We have plenty of capacity to help them, and it doesn't even affect you.",
         "I think it\u2019s fair to say all bets are off. Democracy died in plain sight while we all watched.",
         "I\u2019m not suggesting legislation. As commander in chief, he can order military assets to be handed over.  Yes it is arguably a crime, but an official act.",
         "Alternatively, they can increase their own defense investments and approach the USA as equals. They have the GDP and defense industry base to do so. European and East Asian nations effectively decolonizing themselves from US national security assistance would erase a key advantage of the USA in global affairs.\n\n\nThat's not even getting into the nuclear proliferation issues that would arise from a US security withdrawal. There are quite a few nations who depend on the USA's nuclear umbrella that are capable of building a bomb for themselves.",
         "Don't hand them over, just have them delivered to the Poland/Ukraine border and parked on the Poland side with keys in them.... \n\nJust like we dropped aircraft off in airfields on the Canadian border in WW2 and the Canadians came over the border, taxied them across the border and then delivered them to Britain.",
         "And I'm fine with that too. We share a common language and even those that we don't share a language with, many speak english as a second. Many similar cultural values. Shit, I watch the Premier League from time to time and many Europeans love the NFL and the NBA. We don't NEED to be the head of the snake. I don't want us to be. We can be allies without America putting itself in front of the barrel of foreign superpowers. What we don't need is the US protecting them like a mother hen while not recieving our fair due.\n\n  \nEdit: and while that may lose some influence, I'm more okay with that than compared to fighting a pseudo cold war against Russia and possibly China in the future to protect someone else's land.",
         "The USA does receive its fair due, that's the point, being the undisputed leader of a democratic world order comes with significant benefits. Reducing US influence over global economic and security affairs without directly receiving anything in return is not an America First policy."

Trump has already threatened to not just fire Smith, but have him deported. Though deporting Smith would be hard, given that he\u2019s a natural-born citizen, it\u2019s still easy for Trump to get rid of all the cases against him.",

He does all this BS and yet somehow he's an innocent victim and how dare those big mean Democrats \"go after him\" (hold him accountable for his crimes).\n\nNow he's about to become president again and he'll have presidential immunity. If he commits crimes as \"official acts,\" it's fine. And Republicans will make excuses for everything he does, because he's *always* the victim. Nothing is *ever* his fault.\n\nTrump says a lot of stupid things. But one very smart thing he said was **\"I could stand in the middle of 5th avenue and shoot someone and not lose any voters.\"** He was right. Trump voters give him a free pass on everything, because all crimes are okay when Trump commits them. Totally not a dictatorship!",

It was on an article about one of Trump's court cases and I expressed skepticism about him every being held accountable for anything. This guy was so confident in the justice system, told everyone to come back to the comments on the day of the verdict. I think about that every time he gets the can kicked down the road. I'll think about it when Trump fires Jack Smith and issues himself a pardon, which includes state crimes. But a President can't pardon a state crime! Like the rules matter anymore.

Now that he is President Elect that is even more true.\n\nWith Trump controlling the White House, Senate, and likely the House along with SCOTUS, he will find a way to squash the state cases as well.  I could even see a new federal law baked into some bigger bill that would prevent New York from being able to detain Trump after he leaves office.",

Even if the court could there\u2019d be no one to prosecute as Trump will immediately weaponize the DOJ to block all prosecution of himself.\n\nThe corruption will be unlike anything we\u2019ve ever seen. We will go from an independent DOJ to one run by a raving fascist hell bent on prosecuting every political enemy the good has ever had.",
         "In theory they can.  When Trump tried to drop the case against that QAnon general (I'm blanking on the name right now,) the court made noises about continuing anyway, and even appointed a new prosecutor.  That was really just a symbolic protest, though, and the court quickly gave up.  It would be a million times harder if the defendant is the President.\n\n**EDIT:** [General Flynn](https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/14/politics/john-gleeson-profile/index.html).  The judge's protest sort of did work, in that it forced the President to pardon Flynn instead of just sweeping the case under the rug.  It's still very hard to imagine that the court could have gone all the way through trial and sentencing without the DOJ on board.",
         "Lol the courts don't matter anymore.",

         "One could argue that since Trump is now presumed to be President Elect that the supremacy clause already is in effect and he is basically untouchable as of now.  The reason for this is the president elect uses the 75 day window to form his cabinent and start to receive classified information and other briefings so he is prepared to start governing on day 1.  Locking up a President Elect would effectively interfere with these functions and I believe that violates the Supremacy Clause.\n\nRight or wrong, any attempt by Merchan to lock Trump up would quickly be challenged and stayed by the courts.  Trump would all but surely get a stay from the SCOTUS if the state or lower federal courts didn't act.  By the time this could be resolved, Trump would be inaugurated and the whole thing will automatically be stayed for 4 years.\n\nOf course, Trump is going to find a way, I assure you, in those 4 years to quash the New York case along with all the others.  He has the House, he has the Senate, he has the presidency, and he has SCOTUS.  The legal cases are over.",

Trump calls himself a fixer, and he will be given a leash to fix things, but the leash is short....elections in two years. And if Trump does cause an economic slide, Dems will probably at least even the Senate again potentially in two years and win back the House if they don't win it tonight. There's actually a good chance of that occurring if Dems don't totally lose motivation.\n\nA lot of the things Trump has said he would do, people either don't take him seriously about doing or don't consider the ramifications if he did.

Gas prices were cheap when he was in office because it was COVID and they were desperate to sell all the gas before it went bad, also the president has nothing to do with setting gas prices.

Hopefully they stop relying on abortion to flip white women to the party\n\nDumb ass Democrats clung on to abortion like idiots when the writing on the wall was clear it's the economy stupid. \n\nFurthermore states like FLA an MO have demonstrated they can vote for trump while supporting abortion through state level referendums. \n\nFor example FLAs got to 58npercent of a needed 60 to overturn the abortion ban there. And Missouri literally succeeded. \n\nLike trump said, abortion is not the firebrand issue the Dems though\n\nAnd the vote shows that white women can vote based on their pocketbokk and still support abortion bans..further trump said NO National Ban and return the issue to states to decide. As he predicted and I mention some were more liberal than we assumed \n\n\nThen as a black man I think how in our circles we talk about reparations. The say No reparations the best I can do for you is abortion.  Abortion just isn't the big issue\n\n\n2. The disregard for the Palestine issue. No explanation needed\n\n3. No plan for migrants. Spends years calling trump racist and ignore calls tomshut down border only to have Biden do it in the last half of 24. Signalling republicans were right all along. \n\n4.  Then I think of young men. When I went to college in 2013, all that rape culture, toxic masculinity white privilege stuff was just coming out and we found it a little weird then too. Ten years later, kids who grew up with it from their toddler years to now are over it . Manospnere people and Rogan not feeling it. Young men went trump \n\n5.

         "This is because Hispanic is a label white people use to describe an entire continent of peoples, who are different from each other and are perfectly capable of disliking each other.\n\nMost Hispanic US citizens' ancestors came from Mexico, Cuba, Puerto Rico, or the Dominican Republic. They either came in on legal immigrant visas or, in Puerto Rico's case, were always US citizens. Furthermore, the Hispanic peoples in the US are now deeply rooted and have been in the US multiple generations. Many who are US-born don't even speak Spanish. \n\nThey simply don't see themselves as connected to refugees and illegal immigrants, who now mostly come from Venezuela, Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala. Just because these countries are also majority Spanish-speaking doesn't make them the same. They are of different ethnicities. Remember that many refugees are Indigenous people who don't even always speak Spanish.\n\nSo some US citizen Hispanics react to them the same way white British people did to white Eastern European immigrants a decade ago - with revulsion, and a willingness to do whatever it takes to keep them out. They are US citizens and don't think deportation will happen to them - and tbf, it probably won't.\n\nThe fact that opposition to immigration nationwide is driven largely by white hostility to more Hispanic and Asian faces in the country doesn't matter. There are plenty of Hispanic men who are willing to identify as white for this reason - just as many immigrants in the UK and their descendants voted for Brexit. You don't have to be white to be racist. And you certainly don't have to be white to be sexist, transphobic, or authoritarian.",

We will get some high profile episodes where an armed immigrant stands off against SWAT in suburban cul de sacs. There will be a massive chilling effect, where illegals will just vanish from society.

Protesters and resistance by bureaucracy will slow that effort down, if it gets real bad. But maybe around 100,000 people will be cruelly abused and deported, with no legal recourse. That means some legal residents and citizens will get unfairly arrested, and put on buses.

We can clearly look up flat out blatant lies he\u2019s made and been caught on but people will choose to ignore them. He threatens anyone and everyone depending on the way the wind blows but people will ignore it and look past it, still loving him and the qualifications part is debatable - on one hand he has run successful businesses, though they have been plagued with corruption and he\u2019s also had many failed ones as well, but still he has done it. But his ability to pick people for staffing has been horrible at the government level, the turnover under his first administration was unprecedented. Not only his hired staff but you had military generals saying they couldn\u2019t work for him. I guess I\u2019m wondering why, compared to what has been a fully documented history, Harris has been found to be less likeable, trustworthy and qualified? And I mean this as an actual question.

Hopefully they stop relying on abortion to flip white women to the party\n\nDumb ass Democrats clung on to abortion like idiots when the writing on the wall was clear it's the economy stupid. \n\nFurthermore states like FLA an MO have demonstrated they can vote for trump while supporting abortion through state level referendums. \n\nFor example FLAs got to 58npercent of a needed 60 to overturn the abortion ban there. And Missouri literally succeeded. \n\nLike trump said, abortion is not the firebrand issue the Dems though\n\nAnd the vote shows that white women can vote based on their pocketbokk and still support abortion bans..further trump said NO National Ban and return the issue to states to decide. As he predicted and I mention some were more liberal than we assumed \n\n\nThen as a black man I think how in our circles we talk about reparations. The say No reparations the best I can do for you is abortion.  Abortion just isn't the big issue\n\n\n2. The disregard for the Palestine issue. No explanation needed\n\n3. No plan for migrants. Spends years calling trump racist and ignore calls tomshut down border only to have Biden do it in the last half of 24. Signalling republicans were right all along. \n\n4.  Then I think of young men. When I went to college in 2013, all that rape culture, toxic masculinity white privilege stuff was just coming out and we found it a little weird then too. Ten years later, kids who grew up with it from their toddler years to now are over it . Manospnere people and Rogan not feeling it. Young men went trump \n\n5. Latinos didn't care about trump attacks on migrants. The ones who can vote are already citizens \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udfff\u200d\u2642\ufe0f. Why would they care about people who \"skipped the line\"\n\n6.. I could go on but this election effort from Dems just seems incompetent. \n\nI was poised to see trump lose popular but he shellacked her. This is a clear mandate. As a Kamala voter, I support Trump's win and hope he does well to help us all do better. His tone is victory speech was presidential and no I don't think he's gonna be a dictator. Yeah Dems, don't be hyperbolic next time and say more than I'm not him!",

They were refused service purely because they were gay, and that should not be acceptable. That's why it's not a 'compelled speech' argument. There was no statement, design, wording etc in which to refuse, they could have asked for a plain white cake. So it wasn't about compelled speech, it was about who they are.\n\n\"the act of making the cake was part of the expected conduct of Phillips's business, and not an expression of free speech nor free exercise of religion.\"\n\n I personally don't feel that religion gives you the right to discriminate on the bases of orientation, among other things. Now, if there is offensive message or such, then that is not the same. It's a cake, what harm does it cause you? If they wanted you to draw a dildo, fine, refuse it.

Which sexual orientation is in Colorado.\n\n> Instead, they get litigious and try and ruin someone else's life for their choices while demanding others blindly and endlessly support their own life choices.\n\nThat's the fallacy, your religion governs YOU. Your religion does not get to govern ME. And that's what you're trying to do, force your religion on others by deny service under it's direction. It's funny when people think that someone just wanting to live their life and order a cake to celebrate a moment every other hetero couple does is somehow 'endlessly supporting their life choices' or 'shoving it in faces'. They're just living their life. In reality, by refusing service you are affecting others ability to live a free life by enforcing YOUR religious covenants on others.\n\nWhile you have freedom of religion, to practice it.

She can do it but that job starts 108 days ago.",
         "She didn't bother to stick around to address the crowd, because she doesn't care. The Presidency would've just been another undeserved stripe on her shirt to remain in house she never belonged in, on a hill she should've never been on.

         "The goalposts were constantly moved for her. She had to literally be perfect. Her being a woman, made that impossible to a lot of people.\n\nThe American public and rural morons, and people who didn't show up this election, have no one to blame but themselves.",

People wanted those terrible things to stop so they voted Biden. \n\nTrump is not president so all he can do is talk and that lures people into a false sense of security, short memories, that he\u2019s not dangerous and all the hype then about never trump looses its teeth. And then as you said they aren\u2019t left with much to lure voters, especially because voters tend to love u doing the previous admins work regardless of how good or bad it was,  it Kamala is this current admin. \n\nIt was a mistake to run the current vp in race like this.

Twice in a row they picked the Vice to be the next candidate, so they all kind of look like one big exclusive club. I imagine people had similar feelings after Reagan/Bush.\n\nEventually there becomes a tired old lineup even if they were good, and people longing for a fresh shakeup turn elsewhere. It happened here in the UK. The Prime Minister role became a poison chalice after Cameron quit. Snap elections, low approval, controversy and corruption. The last straw is different for different people but the result was a loud Labour landslide.",
         "Yeah one of the biggest losers from this election unfortunately is females vying for office. After two losses like that, I doubt the dnc will even really consider another for quite a while as they can\u2019t afford to take another chance. And you know the republicans aren\u2019t going to ever elect one. Policies and party lines are one thing, but I feel misogyny against women in power is much greater than people realize",

Did anyone think Trump was electable when he first appeared ? No. Need to stop with \u201cwhat\u2019s the best profile\u201d strategy. 80% of Americans will care less if a candidate is gay as long as he speaks to them.",

She should have been the candidate out the gate they pushed. \n\nRunning halfway with Joe Is absolutely a part of why we are here. \n\nKamala Harris is not less likeable than trump, trump obviously has a much stronger branding at this point, and a lot of the drummed up drama about her was very effective.",
         "I was actually hopeful until she openly started courting Republicans and made that her main selling point. The Dick Cheney endorsement spelt the beginning of the end. She had momentum when she presented herself as the opposite of Trump instead of Trump without the bigotry.",

         "I definitely don\u2019t think she\u2019ll go back to the senate simply because it\u2019s a lower position of power than vice president. I know William Howard Taft became the Chief Supreme Court Justice, but that was during a different social and political. It would be insane for the Democratic Party to renominate seeing that she already lost, and I think won\u2019t be in the limelight anymore similarly to Mike Pence",

         "California has two young-ish Democratic senators, so I don\u2019t see either one stepping aside unless they run for Governor or something.",
         "I think you're likely reading too far into it. The right was never going to vote for her, doubly so as a black woman, and the far left was likely never going to vote for her without a full throated rebuke of Israel (which would probably alienate her center-left core). People might cite Obama or Biden as an excuse (I'm not seeing any of that from non-voters or Trump voters) but if they do I'm almost certain it would be a cover for deeper ideology. Any outsider, without a primary, would have suffered a lot of the same criticism (not picked democratically, blah blah); meanwhile a primary would have deepened fractures the democratic voter base as in 2016. I think Kamala was probably the best candidate for the moment and ran close to the best campaign possible given the circumstances, but Trump has a deeply authoritarian-leaning core constituency and then won a bunch of economy voters on top of that that would have voted for any Republican candidate on that issue alone.",
         "Too many controversies. \n\nTheir best bet is pick a young, progressive, handsome white guy who can appeal to young men and convince them that they're not beta cucks for believing in women's rights or whatever. And when I mean young, I mean like 37 or something.",
         "Too slick. I\u2019m guessing someone not currently in politics.",
         "Look at North Carolina. Who won the Governor race, and who lost? And then look at who won and who lost the Presidential race in NC. \n\nThis isn\u2019t an outlier. Obama was the outlier. I don\u2019t agree with this, and don\u2019t think it should be like this, but the Dems need to run a straight white man if they want to win.",
         "Unfortunately, there are large blocks of religious Americans who are backwards enough to disagree.",
         "Trumps also a cishet white guy though. Buttigieg being gay would probably hurt him, he\u2019s just a very straight-coded gay so it wouldn\u2019t hurt him as much as it might hurt others.",

         "I think we need to stop pushing the blame onto politicians. The American people are at fault for this. Every single person who could have voted but didn't is at fault. It's not the DNC's fault it's not Harris' fault it's not Trump's fault. It's our fault.",

         "Different standards. Trump never once put forward a precise plan of anything. 12 years later he just has concepts of a health plan. People don\u2019t want to hear plans because they\u2019re too complicated for the the average person to even understand. They want someone to blame",

But you have to remember that a lot of people are suffering, even if the economy is doing better, inflation really hurt people, especially lower income families.  Trump called them garbage but also said Biden/Harris was to blame and that he would fix it.  And if you are trying to get food on the table, maybe being called garbage isn't the worst thing? \n\nThis is where democrats miss in the message.",
         "They really don\u2019t and also what does that have to do with running on actual policy?\n\n\u201cTrump bad\u201d is not a platform. Why do you think even Latinos went red? New Jersey went from +16 to +4 Dem with some countries even flipping for the first time. That is insane. \n\nEveryday Americans felt unseen and unheard by the Harris campaign. Trump is a geriatric but he still was on the ground campaigning in battleground states. Wtf was Kamala doing? She didn\u2019t even win a primary and thought she could coast?\n\nBut yeah we can keep blaming external factors instead of asking why Democrats have been such losers for almost a decade straight.\n\nShe lost to Jill Stein in one county LOL"

         "I don\u2019t think it matters. What matters is who people see the parties representing or towards which ends they are working. \n\nIn this case, a significant chunk of voters feel that Democrats are primarily concerned with college-educated professionals, the types of people they *respect* for their intelligence and worldliness. They feel that Democrats mock and malign voters who live in poor rural areas, voters without tertiary education, voters who stay in their hometowns.\n\nBy contrast, a significant chunk of voters feel that MAGA is primarily concerned with the American worker left behind by globalization, the rural poor left out of the national conversation on inequality and disinvestment, the people whose anxieties about crime and social cohesion are ignored, dismissed, and derided as racist. That Democrats primarily frame MAGA as a movement concerned with white racists may be further accelerant for minority Trump supporters, validating their sense of being ignored and misunderstood.\n\nTo go on a tangent, Democrats and liberals in general have failed to get a real handle on what is happening with men psychologically and it\u2019s hurting them. Men don\u2019t see themselves as \u201cwinners\u201d, even when they are. Many men do not possess the skills to process the dissonance between the world they were socialized to believe they would inherit if only they showed up and the reality of being signed up for a lifetime appointment to a position that depresses them. They are still expected to be \u201cproviders\u201d and \u201cworker bees\u201d and \u201cprotectors\u201d but see their female counterparts excel academically, professionally, and socially. \n\nWhen they look at Democrats, they see people unencumbered by the challenges they have to face - they are bitter about the success that seems to come to easily to them, the unfairness of the salary differential between a marketing manager and a factory worker, and the attention given to the plight of the LGBT community (for example) when they feel *less than* people like that. \n\nWhen they look at MAGA, they *believe* that they are specifically included in the plan - that they are primed to share in the economic gains. That they can finally have financial independence, support a family, and be \u201cmasters of their own castle\u201d. They can *fulfill their role as men*. Without it, they\u2019d have to accept they are just another cog in a corporate machine - accepting that would profoundly shake their understanding of their place in the world; it would make the pressures they face not worth the potential return at all. Many, too many, decide not to stick around to find out if they were right.\n\nWhen Democrats talk about the \u201cstraight white man\u201d, they alienate hard working people just trying to fulfill their roles they have always been taught, and continue to be policed, to perform. They have to find a way to present a cohesive vision that not only includes all people, but specifically addresses the real concerns and anxieties faced by a significant chunk of half the population. \n\nUnifying working/middle-class men and women against the corporate erosion of the American community could be a start, but it won\u2019t work if Democrats are more focused with creating national communities of interest based on racial and sexual identities rather than focusing on how we connect to our neighbors and spatial communities.",

Jack Smith reports to the Attorney General of the United States - currently Merrick Garland (appointed by Biden).\n\nOnce Trump takes office, he will surely put his own puppet AG in place who will end the investigation and drop federal charges against Trump.\n\nTRADITIONALLY the AG of the US acts independently from the presidency even though they are appointed by the POTUS - however, we saw during last Trump admin, tradition means nothing to him/them.\n\nMy opinion: Garland was a freaking blanket. He should have immediately opened the investigation, and they should have been extremely aggressive with the Trump cases. Garland seemed too concerned with \"optics\" of an administration prosecuting a former POTUS being politically motivated, that justice itself was cast aside. Fuck Garland.\n\nAlso, Biden should have put pressure on Garland/AG's office to pursue this. HE knew what was at stake, yet again \"optics\" came into play. Fuck Biden too. There was so much that could be done that they didn't do because of optics and politics. Now look where we are.\n\nTrump doesn't give a fuck about optics or tradition. This is the case of playing Monopoly with a chimpanzee - he doesn't know the rules, doesn't care about the rules, and instead flings shit around the room. Apparently, we Americans really like the shit.\n\nThere are still state level charges that Trump can't dismiss - but what are they going to do - put a sitting president in jail?",

Probably won't even attend his trials anymore at this point, and I doubt anyone would force him to.\n\nHe's gonna get away with it, and I always knew he would. Elected or not. But definitely now.",

He tried to do this in his first term, but this time he'll appoint a more loyal Attorney General that will have no qualms about this. There is literally nothing stopping him from outright ending them on day one and pardoning himself (yes, a president can apparently pardon himself), killing any chance for a future prosecution.\n\nHe attempted a coup and is going to get away with it with exactly zero consequences. He brought this country to the brink with armed and organized militias storming the capitol building and attempting to send fake electors to change the outcome of an election he lost, and he'll face zero consequences for that. \n\nHe stole boxes of classified documents, hid them from people who rightfully came looking for them, and stored them in insecure locations (including a disused ballroom... with a photocopy machine right next to the trove of documents). He'll face zero consequences for that.\n\nHe has already been convicted for covering up his illegal interference in the 2016 election, but not sentenced. That's a state charge, so he can't pardon himself. But they're not going to sentence a sitting president, so that's on the back burner until he's out of office and likely won't include jail time anyway.\n\nHe's still charged with election interference in Georgia, but they've been doing everything in their power to put the brakes on that since day one. There is zero chance that that prosecution will be put on the back burner for four years and be able to be rebooted once he's out of office. So he'll probably get away with that, too.",

They clearly have no regard for laws passed by a government that I fund with my tax dollars and my ancestors built, so I don't give a single shit that they might be here \"just to work.\" That's simply tough shit for them. They're not my countrymen which actually means something to me and clearly tens of millions of other Americans. I'm not a \"citizen of the world\" and neither is anyone else. They can stay in their countries and work to prosper there, America and other western nations aren't just feeding troughs for the rest of the planet. \n\nI also support aggressively investigating and prosecuting Americans who create the infrastructure that facilitates illegal immigration, along with employers who wipe their asses with federal laws forbidding hiring noncitizens. No, I do not care that this is going to \"raise prices\" for goods and services that depend on slave wages.

Would you be ok with the Navajo, Cherokee, Choctaw, Chippewa and Sioux just to name the main ones deporting families from illegal immigrants to the US? Just a quick bite into the hipocrisy of immigration. Now, to the real thing: what about those legally or with refugee status? What about those looking for sanctuary? What about families that have mixed status? And regardless of your \"I'm wealthy and surely can afford\" BS argument... isn't one of the main reasons for voting GOP now \"the cost of life\"? Are you aware that paying 20USD for picking corn and strawberries will make your McDonalds milkshake a little more expensive? Are you aware of the economical ramifications of a job force unable to sustain itself?  \nWhy in this matter no one talks about better spending into creating paths to legalization and correcting status? Why the only option here has to be the mass deportation? \n\nWhat do you do for a living, if you don't mind me asking?",
         "Interesting that you still don't actually suggest any ways to deal with the ramifications of deporting all these people. Who's going to pay to find them? To transport them? To house them until they're deported? Who's going to pay for the support system needed for all of that? Who's going to deal with their home countries refusing to let them out of the busses and planes we send to them? The logistics for an operation like this are enormous. It's real easy for people like you to just say \"send 'em home!\" But in reality it's going to be nightmare.\n\nJust like citizens they have families here, they have jobs, they have debts and property, etc. How do you deal with all that? The children they had here are citizens. What do we do with them? Send them back with them, where they may not be wanted like their parents weren't wanted here? Force them into orphanages? And this is just scratching the surface. Like it or not, illegal immigrants are part of the backbone of this country - they're the ones out in the fields picking the produce you eat, or in the backs of restaurants prepping food. I'm not saying paying these people minimal amounts under the table is good, but take them away and suddenly those jobs have to go to regular citizens who will have to be paid at least minimum wage.

He's only gotten worse and worse the last four years but he's surged this election and all this support, energy, and enthusiasm for Harris has translated to an absolute cathartic result.\n\nI'm really not sure what to make of this. It's not that it wasn't always a close race but I don't get the wild margins Trump is winning by. Millions of votes in FL and TX and hundreds of thousands in other places, making up huge margin gains in New York. It's like Trump magically gained 10% of the population's vote despite the insurrection, the felonies, and everything else.\n\nI had more faith in our country but history is doomed to repeat itself. This is going to be an election with ripple effects for a generation.\n\nEdit: There was no magic 10%. Trump performed just as he did in 2020. It was the Democratic vote that didn't show up by the millions. That should be a wake up call that Democrats didn't have the pulse of the nation and Harris didn't have the support we were led to believe. Republicans were there in 2020 and they stayed there in 2024. Democrats disappeared in droves.",

But when you go through it, if you\u2019re really being honest we\u2019re just fucked. What things or events had any chance of happening recently? Democrats just failed to find a young, strong white guy after Obama and this nation is paying for it. You have to go back at least that far.\n\nAnd if this country is so fucking ignorant as to vote for Trump after everything he\u2019s done and shown himself to be, then we were only staving it off anyway. Slow or quick, however it\u2019s rolled out, fascism, oligarchy, theocracy, general fucking backsliding diminishes us all.\n\nIt\u2019s going to be quicker than people think. Trump has said every awful thing in the fascist textbook and Harris ran as perfect a campaign as possible. And yet here Trump will have the senate and probably the house. A national mandate for all of it. Every awful idea. Given carte blanche for every  bit of his hate and stupidity.\n\nWe\u2019ve lost. Every single citizen has lost in this whether they know it or not. We just elected the first true autocrat and yes it will be different this time.

The doctrine required broadcasters to provide fair coverage of all sides of a public issue. It was officially abolished by the FCC in 1987.\n\n2) Permitting corporate funding of political candidates, the landmark Supreme Court case Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission in 2010 significantly changed the landscape of campaign finance in the United States. The Court ruled that corporate funding of independent political broadcasts in candidate elections cannot be limited under the First Amendment. This decision effectively allowed corporations and unions to spend unlimited amounts of money on political campaigns, leading to the rise of Super PACs (Political Action Committees).\n\nI would add a third important decision by the Supreme Court helped to chip away at democracy and pave way to autocracy.

We want lower taxes, we want our 401ks to thrive and for the S and P 500 to skyrocket.

         "Watch the video. Read the transcript. Get some literacy. \n\nAlso he wasn\u2019t running.\n\nAnd Trump called me garbage because I\u2019m a dem. He said we\u2019re the enemy within. \n\nGo away.",
         "\u201cSupporter\u2019s\u201d you missed the \u2018s. Also, if you can read you\u2019d see it\u2019s the demonization that is garbage. And most important, he\u2019s not running",
         "Please read carefully. Supporters in this context don't mean voters but rather the people who are his parties. especially the one who said that they Puerto Rican is garbage. \n\nRead more, and an s can make a huge difference. Please triple checks things. In my line of work, this can cost millions.",
         "He also said he'd like to smack Trump supporters \"in the ass\", whatever that means.",
         "yes, that\u2019s verbatim what he said. They changed the written transcription. He may not have meant it, but that\u2019s what he said. Maybe calling half of the country garbage could\u2019ve galvanized voters.",
         "Never gonna beat the weird allegations.",
         "So it's a vote on policy level?",
         "Hope not with the wars, I voted trump for boots on the ground in Iran",
         "I see your point, there is a bit of unfair generalization there. Should read \u201cto white supremacists, all minorities are a threat\u201d",
         "Yes, the Democrats would be better off narrowing down the foe to WASP.\n\n\nWhite basically dilutes the whole thing.",

         "Yeah, again you're grammaring backwards. He is describing the priorities held by the voting blocs, not the priorities that they are being ranked in importance over each other.",
         "No, you are just distinctly misunderstanding basic grammatical structure to interpret a sentence backwards.",
         "In 2020 I thought Trump and the people he appointed were diasterous at managing Covid beyond the first couple months during the \"what the hell is this thing\" fog of uncertainty. But between him stirring up division to try and boost his popularity with anti-vax population rather than trying to beat Covid, having more and better information on the dangers but not managing it properly imo, and his general lack of science minded and medical professionals as his advisors he was a terrible choice for president going into Covid.\n\nBiden's fiscal policy, and frankly Trump's too, are thrown out the window when you have some global pandemic no one has seen in their lifetime, you just have to. And since that wasn't a concern anymore, and Biden surrounded himself with respected doctors and physicians, I thought even if he didn't have the knowledge, he picked the right people. My wife is a nurse and type 1 diabetic so this was something I watched and read closely. Things like the Pfizer white papers and outcomes in Israel and England. He was the obvious choice to me at that time.\n\nBut Alpha Covid and Omicron Covid might as well be separate diseases with how the level of danger was radically different, but the recommendations were still heavy handed and driven more by politics than physicians or scientists then. With Covid not such a concern and the massive impact my family has felt from the increasing cost of living, I felt Trump and his appointments would be better fit and I prefer conservative fiscal policy. I hate his RFK Jr attachment and the amount of exposure the Joe Rogan-style skepticism around food and pharma will get. But to me that's the hand that was dealt.",

         "Nope.  100% truth.  \n\nYour emotional outburst is something you\u2019ll have to deal with.",
         "Cmon, he didn't say that.  And he's barely the president anymore anyway (has anyone seen him?).  You don't have to keep lying for him anymore.  It's widely proven there was no 's..",

         "Kinda\u2026 I\u2019d say I\u2019m a centrist, but probably lean slightly more to republican side, maybe 60-40 or 70-30. If someone like Chris Christie had been the nominee, this would\u2019ve been a much easier decision.",
         "I meant ukraine and Gaza.  As far as Iran I'm sure trump will deal with them",
         "I literally do not have enough time in the day to put together all of the instances where Trump directly and indirectly stated his disgust for minorities and you aren't here to converse in good faith anyway",

While I don't agree on all points, I appreciate the candid and detailed explanation.\n\nHonestly, if social media was 100x more this and not what it usually becomes, we might not get stuck between a rock and a dumb place every 4 years or so.\n\nBest to you and your family, whatever comes next.",

         "Ah well, at least you guys have tariffs to look forward to.  With republicans getting the senate, house, executive and a supreme court supermajority, it should be interesting to see just how much harm america can inflict on itself in two years.  If only the us were a small, economically and militarily insignificant nation I wouldnt care so much, but we\u2019ll also get to see how much the us can fuck up the rest of the world whilst he\u2019s at it.\n\nI\u2019m just fucking angry that i have to read about that idiot\u2019s fuckups for another 4 years (if vance doesn\u2019t take over sooner).\n\nI don\u2019t understand the usa any more\u2026.

I'm not the biggest Biden fan but I bought into his \"soul of the nation\" argument, all the speeches and rhetoric about \"who we really are\". That veil has shattered now, more so than in 2016. America can't stand for these ideals when more than half of Americans reject them and choose the opposite.",

         "No Jon, we are tired of always having to fight. And this just proves that most of America is exactly what we are fighting against and there is a level of apathy in the non-voting population that does not care one bit. \n\nThat said, there are a few ways I will conduct my business to make it harder for the coming oligarchy to reign; for starters, delete Twitter.  Just don't give that platform any ad revenue. Tank its user base and let those corporations find some place else to go. Elmo does not need more help than he can get.  \n\nHoard money.  Just save as much money as you can. Buy local, buy used when applicable, learn to do things yourself as much as possible.\n\nTake care of your health.  Eat right and exercise.\n\nWe don't know how much fuckery the right is going to do to elections going forward, but if you can move from a red state to a swing state, maybe try for that, but if you truly feel vulnerable and can manage it, move to a blue state.  The issue with moving from a red to a blue state is it further stratifies the divide between how many red states there are versus blue states which then sends more power to the Senate towards the republicans. There are far more red states than blue states.\n\nLastly, just love your loved ones. Hold them and protect them.  Cherish all the good times you will have going forward, and yes, even amongst the coming misery, there will be good times as well. Value those moments. This malaise will last for a bit, but eventually you will recenter yourself. So don't lose hope, stay active with friends and family, and take the positives when you can.",

         "Fight for.... what exactly? The idea of American exceptionalism?  Well I hate to break it to Jon, but American exceptionalism isn't a history of exceptionalism at all.  It's a history of greed and mistreatment.\n\nWe're a nation built on slavery, war, civil rights violations, and over consumption.  Our main benefit over other nations seems to just be that we're on a continent that's difficult to invade that is resource rich.\n\nKnow how everyone is real worried about climate change right now?  The US has topped the charts for worst GHG emitters per capita on the planet for the past 150 years straight.  We are the world's foremost cause of climate change.  But we Americans are better than the rest of the world, we're exceptional, which is why we've all decided to give up flying for vacations, give up driving SUVS, and we all agreed to limit our HVAC and hot water use to what's tolerable rather than what's perfect.  Oh and we've all limited our consumption of beef of course!\n\nWait... we've all done those things right?  It's not just me?  Nah, the vast majority of us have done absolutely none of those things because we're Americans, exceptional Americans!  We're the best.  We're the good.\n\nHow about modern wars since WWII?  Vietnam.  Korean.  Iraq.  Afghanistan.  Ukraine.  Israel/Gaza (a genocide, not a war).  The US has either directly taken part in these, or has at least had their hands in all of them.  We're exceptional at war and killing.  Our military spending is more than the next 10 largest military spending nations!\n\nWe also have a long history of foreign regime changes to those who are more willing to support our bid to mine / buy their resources... can't forget about that!\n\nOh right right, it's not our international or planetary policy that makes us exceptional... it's our social policy!  A history of slavery and civil rights violations, but that's in the past.  We're not currently still dealing with racism, sexism, homophobia, xenophobia, and sexism!  We're far too exceptional for that. /s  \n\nWhen Democrats, the party of good, had a super majority, the last time being in 2009 during Obama, they couldn't be bothered with codifying abortion rights, or real single payer universal healthcare, or reparations for ancestors of slaves, or immigration policy, or even helping the little guy instead of corporations during a recession.  They did pass Obamacare real fast though, which seems to have done almost nothing to control our healthcare costs that are among the highest in the world.\n\nHow about this election... it seems we've elected Trump again, a geriatric convicted felon, rapist, fraud businessman who in his last term attempted to lead an insurrection and destroy US Democracy, and whom his own administration cabinet doesn't support.  Funny enough, as far as I can tell, many of his supporters don't even care about politics or know anything about actual policy... many are literally just voting for him to troll the US and the liberals / establishment / elite.  They're upset, they're angry, and they want to own the libs / establishment.  That's the extent of it of their justification for voting Trump.  That's a sign of being exceptional, FYI...\n\nOh right, Democracy... THAT's what truly makes us exceptional.  Except that the electoral college is clearly corrupt, and our winner take all system is also easily corrupted to give results that aren't representative of the voter demographics, whether districts are gerrymandered or not.  Other nations do representation far better than us, where every vote truly matters.  In the US, if your district votes 50.01% to 49.99%, and you're on the 49.99% side, your vote automatically gets counted as going to the other candidate as if you supported and voted for them and their policies.  Isn't that nice everyone?!\n\nMeanwhile, those people who fight against the two party system, and for real change, or stand up to a given party and demand changes, they're listed as the problem by the status quo voters.

I'm not joking, that is the end of it. There is no critical thought about *why* or *how* prices changed. There is no recognition of economic trends. There is no consideration of other policies - maaaaybe immigration depending on their media diet.\n\nEverything about sexism, racism, etc yes that can be true of his base and makes up contributing factors.

Nevermind that that cost of living has gone up everywhere (I'm currently living in Canada, CoL is *much* higher here than where I lived in the States - is that Biden's fault too?). What matters is that when Trump was president things were cheap and when Biden was president things were expensive, so if Trump is president again things will be cheap again. Nevermind that the events which *led* to this happened under Trump, because again the electorate literally cannot comprehend that anything can happen on a timescale beyond a couple days (slight /s).\n\nI'm not downplaying people's struggles - shit is expensive right now. It can be hard to get by. And part of me wants to be charitable because it is *hard* to try and understand politics when you are trying to feed your family while your bills go up faster than than your paycheck.

         "States decide their election process, so fortunately I don't think that will happen.\n\nWe also saw that Republicans voted early and by mail about as frequently as Democrats this time around, so it wouldn't really be a great idea either.\n\nIncreasing the voting age they could probably do though I'm not sure what benefits that offers either. Trump apparently was able to get through to the young male vote via podcasts, so would he want to cut off his potential voters?\n\nUltimately it seems like it was the Democrats who just put up a less favorable candidate it seems. I'm still baffled by that, but a lot of us are in a Reddit or liberal bubble, so I guess we didn't see the signs."

MAGA quite literally control all branches of government. Back in 2016 Trump was kinda sorta on his own. He was pushing his way through but there were still moderate senators and congressmen who would push back against him, and traditional republicans still held seats. Now? Trump has MAGA politicians from the supreme court down to the local level. Being disrespectful and brash got him exactly what he needs for his 2nd term. A group of political yes men who will rubber stamp whatever he sends them.\n\nTrump proved that you don't need respect, you don't need decorum, you can do and say whatever the fuck you want as long as you keep going with it. I mean by the end, as much as I hate the guy and voted against him twice now, I was laughing at the shit he was doing. Putting TRUMP on the side of a garbage truck and saying it's for Joe and Kamala was fucking hilarious, I don't care who you are, and it engages with people and makes headlines. Doesn't matter if those people are morons who will vote for him, he won the game. \n\nDemocrats need to figure out how to play that game, because frankly they fucking suck at it.

The fact that Democrats don't understand this, think that it is voters that owe the party something rather than vice versa, and continue along with this delusion loss after loss, pretty much disproves the idea that any of them can \"represent\" normal Americans.\n\nThey are showing up to a job interview, and their argument is \"You owe it to me to hire me\" rather than \"Here is what I can do for the firm\". No one is going to hire someone like that. And this attitude is never going to result in any good electoral outcomes for the Democrats, so it is ultimately self-defeating!",

He's not even socially conservative in his personal life but some of the people who support him on the other hand really are. Said people made the think tank and I can see the association but it'd be as if I were to call Biden a socialist because some people who call themselves democratic socialists have rallied behind him. For all we know, the way US politics are structured, these people simply get behind a big name to push their own agendas.\nAs for JD Vance writing a foreward to it, is that even the case? Did he do it consciously for them or was that taken from him without the context of what he was promoting? I don't know about that.",

I'm going to keep doing what Biden has been doing (who's also very centrist and status quo and why he only BARELY squeaked by in 2020 and is now an incumbent as unpopular as Trump or more) and spent so much time trying to convince Republicans on the fence that she's not so bad.\n\nShe drifted to the right on immigration basically adopting Republican policies minus Trump's outright hatred.\n\nShe didn't talk about healthcare. Medicare for all, universal healthcare, things people can understand and relate to and a not insignificant number of americans know a family member who's gone bankrupt from medical debt.\n\nShe didn't talk about childcare.\n\nShe didn't provide any meaningful input as to how housing is going to be made affordable when the younger generations are being forced into generational housing situations on the coastlines because they literally couldn't even afford to rent a place. GenZ men in particular HEAVILY swung to her because she offers nothing and podcasters like Rogan and Adin Ross and these other far right grifters can plant in their heads see they do nothing for you! TRUMP FUCK YEAH. Speaking of this it's another problem in general with almost no social media presence, the left desperately needs more content creators who can get their message out there in a way young people understand as they've drifted heavily to the right despite the right offering no policy that will improve their lives in any meaningful way. They'll still be sad, poor and angry after mass deportations and tariffs. \n\nShe didn't talk about solutions to corporate interests crushing the lower classes in this country.\n\nShe desperately tried to appeal to REPUBLICAN voters thinking her base was already locked up. See her ads, campaigning with Liz Cheney, etc. Promising to put a Republican in her cabinet, something I could maybe agree on but NOT something you make a bullet point on your fucking campaign where you NEED YOUR BASE DESPERATELY with economic headwinds.\n\nShe didn't voice how she was going to address people's pocketbooks which is basically all your average swing voter ends up voting on at the end of the day.\n\nShe did NOTHING to appeal to actual liberals. This is why Democrat turnout plummeted. We didn't see some crazy increase in Republican turnout vs the previous election.\n\nYou can keep thinking whatever you want but if Harris had ran on literally ANY policy liberals want besides Abortion and Marijuana and tried to address the pocketbook voters even slightly the election could've been much different. She had all the momentum going for, record shattering donations, and she flubbed it.\n\nYou can't just make a stupid argument that 'she wasn't center enough' when Democrats as a whole ever since Obama have just been coasting and drifting to the right.\n\nThis isn't a wow we need to go back to center situation it's a we need to stop being the party of status quo and harm reduction but no solutions.\n\nIf the message Democrats take away from this is wow we need to be even MORE conservative then they are fucking doomed to keep losing elections.",

         "You mean when he said he'd bring in papers to prove the 2020 election was stolen? Kind of surprising he didn't bring those papers to a debate or any of the 60 court cases he lost. \n\nThe guy was talking about how Americans used to flush the toilet 15 times a couple of years ago.

Instead, you see the wealthy profit over and over again under mediocre people, often those specifically who were born into wealth and never had to work much.\n\nUnfortunately, this leads to a focus on social issues that, while are definitely important, do not resonate with the direct needs of the majority of voters. It results in a candidate who seems very \"corporate\", and whose main draw typically is \"well they're better than x\".

She would hit me and compare to my dad who cheated on her and divorced her. No one is buying Kamala\u2019s fake nice act.

You've doomed your fellow Americans to increasing frequency and severity of hurricanes, floods, wild fires and other extreme weather. The same goes for vulnerable countries and regions across the world. This will get worse every year, until large swathes of the US (and the world) will become uninhabitable.\n\n\\- Betrayed your daughters, wives and mothers, as the GOP will strip away women's rights step by step. Same goes for any other minority in the US.\n\n\\- Very likely started a global economic war. If Trump goes ahead with his plans to put tariffs on everything, this will exacerbate a global economic war. It will increase inflation, likely increase interest rates globally, increase unemployment. You probably didn't know, but the Great Depression was caused by economic isolationism and tariffs.\n\n\\- Killed or critically wounded NATO. No European ally will trust the US from this point. We're on our own, and so are you.\n\n\\- Possibly doomed Ukraine to become a Russian vassal state. You probably don't care, because you do not possess the acumen to understand how this undermines Europe, which used to be your main allies, friends and trade partners.\n\n\\- Doomed Palestinians to an even worse genocide. The tragedy of this choice by third party candidate voters is bottomless.\n\n\\- Significantly exacerbated the decline and potential death of US democracy.\n\nYou did this because you are uninformed/misinformed, extremely cynical or just dumb. There is no excuse for what you have done, every man and woman has a responsibility to learn and understand, in order to employ your vote in the best possible way for your fellow human beings, and nature. You failed that horribly.\n\nThis is such a sad, sad day. I feel so bad for those that voted Blue, and for those that will suffer going forward. But this will badly affect the entire world, not only the US, and what you've done cannot be forgiven.\n\nWhere do we go from now? Those of us who understand history and value democracy must band together and do our utmost to defend civil rights and democracy. And hopefully, US democracy survives long enough to vote the GOP out of office after people see how badly this will go.\n\n\\*Edit: typos",

It doesn't allow insurers to set lifetime limits. It requires that insurance companies provide easy-to-understand information online about why they are seeking rate increases. It prevents canceling coverage over minor technical mistakes in paperwork.\n\nin 2017 Trump signed an executive order on inauguration day stating that he planned to repeal it. On July 27, 2017 they voted on it and 50 democrats and John McCain saved it.\n\nThis time they will have 52 senators so they can still afford to have two people cross the aisle.\n\nTwo weeks after that he did this:\nhttps://www.epi.org/blog/the-trump-administrations-attempt-to-dismantle-the-fiduciary-rule-a-year-in-review/\n\nhe got rid of fiduciary laws that required financial experts to work in your best interest and not their own. I'd love to see republicans defend that one, but they don't even know it happened.\n\nAs for other protections, just name them and they'll get rid of them. Food safety regulations surround food recalls will like go away. Back in 2020 the supreme court gave Trump the power to fire the head of the Consumer Financial Protection Board. So that will happen this time around. We're about to have lead paint again. Polluted water. Leaded gas. Asbestos.\n\nRepublicans fucked up big this time.",

That covers federal criminal cases so Jack Smith's cases are DOA. \n\nIn 1997 the SCOTUS ruled in [Clinton v. Jones](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/520/681/) that a civil lawsuit against a current President can proceed if it is unrelated to behavior that occurred during time in office, since executive immunity does not apply. That would be for things like the defamation lawsuits from E. Jean Carrol or the members of congress suing him civilly for Jan 6th. \n\nI can't find any binding precedent that says a state/local prosecutor can't investigate/indict a president for state/local crimes but I'm not sure that's ever been tested. \n\nBetween 2020 and 2016 most of the investigations were coming from Robert\u00a0Mueller\u00a0who was a DOJ Special Council and thus he was bound by the DOJ policy from the Office of Legal Council which dates back to Nixon. \n\nThe point I was getting at is that I think you are mistaken about who did what. I can't find any cases from the SC that says a sitting president has blanket immunity and the House/Senate have no role in determining who can/can't be indicted other than via legislation (again there isn't any existing legislation that says a sitting president can't be indicted that I can find). \n\nYes the federal cases are DOA but the Georgia and NY cases can move forward until a court rules otherwise.",

         "Token amounts of soldiers compared to America. Also ironic since Kamala Harris was the one campaigning with Dick Cheney. The guy who kicked off that whole fucking war.",
         "Well, there was Muller, Mcconnel, Barr, McCarthy, and you know what basically the entire senate (R) agreed, and the all crossed their fingers and add the \"if he involved in an official act...\". And quite recently, they were arguing that stealing classified documents could be considered an official act, even though he wasn't president when he stole them.\n\n  \nHe literally has blanket immunity from everything, and leaves it to the courts to make up the reasons he can't be charged/impeached/etc.",

         "Right... my point is that McConnel, McCarthy, and the entire Congress has no say over wether or not a sitting president can be prosecuted for a crime.  I mean congress can say they don't think it should happen but short of passing legislation that power lies with prosecutors, not Congress. \n\nAnd he can obviously be investigated since Muller was investigating during his first term. \n\nThe only reason we \"can't\" prosecute a sitting president is because of an OLC finding that has no real legal meaning. The intent is to say \"we believe that if this was ever tested in court it would be found unconstitutional and there for it's the policy of the DoJ not to indict a sitting president\". Barr and Muller would have been subject to following the rule as DoJ officials. \n\nIt's never actually been tested because the policy prevents the DOJ from indicting him which would be required for the courts to weigh in.\n\n>And quite recently, they were arguing that stealing classified documents could be considered an official act, even though he wasn't president when he stole them.\n\nThey can argue what ever the hell they want, that doesn't mean the courts have to accept it/that it's binding. Judge Cannon threw out the documents case because she ruled, incorrectly and corruptly imho, that Jack Smith wasn't legitimately appointed. It had nothing to do with immunity. \n\n>He literally has blanket immunity from everything\n\nNo, he doesn't. He has immunity from two things:  \n1) Federal prosecution while in office per DoJ policy\n\n2) Prosecution for crimes that were \"official acts\" while in office and the DoJ has the ability to have some \"official\" acts still be prosecutable as long as they can show that prosecuting him for those crimes will not harm the ability of the office of the president to function. This is the only immunity which has legal precedent behind it.  \n\nNothing else has been ruled immune or tested by the courts. I get why you feel like he has blanket immunity but it's factually incorrect to say he does at this point and until he ACTUALLY has immunity (god forbid) we should be fighting like hell to attempt to hold him accountable where we can (such as in the NY case where he was already found guilty and in the GA case where they are still contemplating if Willis needs to be removed or not.",

Whose answer sounds more apealing?\n\nFlorida: 57% of the vote went to restore abortion rights (needed 60 to pass). 56%  voted for Trump.  \n\nI could go on but lots of issues that matter to people break like this... If you want to be a president for all Americans then you need to have policies that speak to all Americans in a couple of bullet points....

         "No it has already! Slotkin said this all in 2020 and I remember this article so well because I wanted dems to take it to heart.

The decision board guy on CNN did a great summary comparing WI counties last night that clearly explained how they vote there now & why. If I can find the clip - I will put it here. \n\nThey also know & like Trump. \n\nIt\u2019s very, very simple. Keep in mind - there are fewer urban centers in WI compared to MI as well. \n\nI am very happy to be back in MI & Detroit now as a black woman: statistically WI is the worst state in the US for African-Americans and now that will only get worse. \n\nBut it\u2019s a dark day & time overall - even for MI.

No one wants to be talked down to and be made to feel like they're a bad guy, and most people don't care about what's happening on the other side of the world if they're struggling here. \n\nThey just want cheap things, gas, food.

         "Yes. I vote split ticket. I want the parties to work together and come up with neutral center legislation.

         "Shit like this makes me think that trumps strategy of going on the dude bro podcast circuit was extremely effective.",
         "It\u2019s definitely a thing. Since 2016, Republicans have lost or underperformed in races in which Trump wasn\u2019t directly on the ballot. Trump brings out people who are just mad at the system and vote Trump to throw a wrench in it. They\u2019re not loyal republicans. They hate most other Republicans about as much as they hate Democrats. The Republican Party will have a very hard time getting them to show up 2 and 4 years from now.",

If he was only moderately bad he might have driven Democratic turnout to defeat him\u2026..but it\u2019s been obvious for weeks he was going to lose like 55% - 40%.

Please read this if you are going to vote 3rd party. https://rollcall.com/2019/07/29/how-third-party-votes-sunk-clinton-what-they-mean-for-trump/.",
         "Unable to secure what would have been secured by pretty much any other person.\n\nA lot of polling showed that if Republicans nominated Trump in 2015/2016, he likely would have lost to anyone but Hillary Clinton. \n\nAnd her legacy, of that pretty much rigged nomination, is that we are still stuck with him.",
         "I remember that time and how she sort of couldn't. There was resentment toward the Clintons for NAFTA. Bernie, Obama, and others were campaigning there for her in her place because she was so toxic there. She was a terrible candidate to choose for that reason.",

         "Bro what? Iowa isn't everything, after Bernie won New Hampshire and especially Nevada, many mainstream media outlets were saying he was the frontrunner with the most momentum. Pete and Klobuchar dropped out right before Super Tuesday to endorse Biden in what was obviously a coordinated effort.",
         "And after losing to a small town mayor, he went on to win NH and NV. Every other candidate (other than Warren) and the entire party, prompted by the donors, had to then rally around Biden explicitly in an effort to stop Bernie. Not only did they lean on the scale in 2016, in 2020 the entire party mobilized to stop him getting the nomination. These are just facts.",

Looking at the data on google they use historical data to pre determine the results of a state online. If only 40% precincts have reported for a state how do they know a states results with certainty?\n\nI can see this with a number of reporting precincts correlating with the number of remaining voters becoming a mathematical impossibility for the vote to swing back to another candidate.  But then when I checked Mississippi on the map on google it had 4% of precincts reporting but had already given the state to trump? \n\nI\u2019m just asking because I feel like this is part of why people think a states vote was defrauded. Like we\u2019re getting ahead of ourselves a bit before all the results are in. As with Georgia, Pennsylvania and Arizona last time the deciding votes weren\u2019t counted for days. \n\nI\u2019m just hoping someone smarter than me can explain this for me.",

For the vast majority of Spanish speakers, who take pride in their language, this term was never an issue\u2014until it was pushed on them.\n\nYes, there's real progress, with around half of Latino voters now backing same-sex marriage. But \"Latinx\" is a major unforced error by Democrats. As a native Spanish speaker who\u2019s been around Latinos my whole life, even the most progressive ones I know react to \"Latinx\" with a serious eye-roll.

         "With this monster having even won the popular vote, my faith in humanity is well and truly dead. We are not better than this. We really did vote for the convicted felon over the prosecutor. Now comes a new age of authoritarianism, a time of darkness we richly deserve. America has spoken, and admitted that it *wants* to be terrible.",

I no longer want to be associated with this loose coalition that can never get its fucking shit together when it matters. \n\nThanks for the last four years Biden, you did a lot of good things, but America doesn\u2019t want democracy. I\u2019ll never see a Democrat president again in my lifetime.",

         "\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 Today, there is no \u201cthey,\u201d only \u201cwe.\u201d We cling to that illusion of division like it\u2019s the last life raft, pretending we\u2019re not all slowly sinking into the same sea of chaos. Aren\u2019t we supposed to be Americans? Or is that just something we slap on the Fourth of July and forget about once the fireworks are over? As author and activist Arundhati Roy put it, \u201cThe war is not over; it is not even beginning; we are all in it.\u201d (Roy, Field Notes on Democracy, 2008). It\u2019s hard to pretend we\u2019re separate when we\u2019re all in the same sinking boat.\n\nAt some point, we sold our future for pocket change\u2014sacrificing any long-term hope for the shallow comfort of a few extra dollars today. A cheaper tank of gas, a little tax break, maybe even a handful of crumbs to make us feel like we\u2019ve won. And yet, most don\u2019t see how deep Project 2025 and those \u201cinnocent\u201d tariffs will cut into their lives. We\u2019ve become a nation so wrapped up in our own smugness, we\u2019re too distracted to notice the slow-motion disaster heading straight for us. As journalist Chris Hedges said, \u201cWe are a society that is on the edge of ruin, and the people are too distracted by the drama to notice.\u201d (Hedges, America: The Farewell Tour, 2018). The kicker? The ones who cheered it all on are going to be the first ones to feel the sting.\n\nIf this is MAGA\u2019s promised land, then sure\u2014bring on those falling prices, the affordable gas, the groceries that magically cost less. But my gut tells me that\u2019s about as likely as pigs flying. The idea that one person can \u201csave the economy\u201d while conveniently ignoring the rest of the world is almost adorable\u2014like watching a toddler believe that closing their eyes means they\u2019re invisible. As economist Joseph Stiglitz aptly noted, \u201cMarkets are global, and the idea that a single nation can somehow insulate itself from global forces is delusional.\u201d (Stiglitz, Globalization and Its Discontents Revisited, 2017).\n\nWhen the reckoning comes, at least we\u2019ll have the privilege of saying, \u201cwe told you so.\u201d Not that it\u2019ll make a difference. I can already hear the chorus of MAGA voices scrambling to point the finger at everyone else, even though they\u2019ve got the Senate, House, Supreme Court, and Presidency locked down. Watching them contort themselves to blame \u201cthe others\u201d when they\u2019re the only ones with their hands on the wheel will be an impressive spectacle\u2014if it weren\u2019t so painfully predictable. As political commentator Thomas Frank observed, \u201cBlaming the elites is a convenient way of not facing the reality that we, as a society, are complicit in this mess.\u201d (Frank, Listen, Liberal, 2016).\n\nThis country\u2019s moral compass is so broken, it\u2019s practically a modern art piece. We\u2019re hanging on by a thread, and any hope of a miraculous comeback feels like a bad joke. Whatever storm is coming, we rolled out the welcome mat. We earned it\u2014every dark, twisted moment of it. As historian Howard Zinn warned, \u201cThe problem is not that we are too few, but that we are too few who are willing to stand up.\u201d (Zinn, A People\u2019s History of the United States, 1980).  \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8",

         "This idiot author, and the world, and America needs to understand, the republicans have been working with Putin and Russia for decades now on massive disinformation warfare campaigns. The result of this is an electorate that has half transitioned into being Russian citizens living in America, they vote for the interests of Russia. How can you tell what I\u2019m saying is true? Go look at all the Republican Party\u2019s policy objectives. All of it seeks to destroy advancements in tech, society, and stability.\n\nTo give a few examples, they think nato is stupid, and would \u201clet Russia do whatever it wants in Europe\u201d.\n\nTrump said there would be no more elections.\n\nTrump said he would \u201cterminate the constituent of the US\u201d.\n\nEtc.\n\nYes 70+ million US citizens failed at their jobs of being US citizens by voting for treason, but you have to also understand that the US has been fucked over by Russia too.

I wonder why so many choose not to vote.",
         "Sign of laziness which is truly American. There are nearly 250 million eligible voters (over 18 years old) and over 100 million people didn\u2019t vote. Harris has about 15 million fewer votes than Biden in 2020. \n\nIt\u2019s not just about message or which side promises what or the process in which a candidate was chosen. \n\nA lot of Americans are lazy and negligent in their civic duty.

         "As a non American, I learned a valuable lesson too. That I was a fool to think the Reddit echo chamber was representative of American sentiment as a whole. That I was naive to take hope from it. That I was taken in by Hollywood to think that wholesome American values are real. That I would be stupid to stay around. I\u2019m unsubbing from all the politics and news subs. This site is good for vapid memes only.",

Others literally don't give a sht and just vote based on popular culture. Especially young white males (I hate to say it).\n\nAt some point you either learn fire is hot by someone telling you. Or you learn fire is hot by getting burned. America chooses the latter.\n\nThe Supreme Court allows Trump to act without concern for US laws. And he has a supermajority with the House and the Senate. We entered a dictatorship. They can alter all laws, including election laws federally and rubber stamp them. The gravity of the situation (even for future elections) hasn't dawned on people.

         "I think the larger issue is that the two parties just don't compete the same way. That's gotta be why Trump has an edge with the everyman; he does the stuff that they imagine themselves doing while in power. When someone says something he doesn't like at a debate, he doesn't wait for them to finish, say something like \"Well, you see, that's a gross misrepresentation of the facts. Actually, based on a current study...\" he just leans into the microphone and says \"WRONG\". And people eat it up, you know? Because that's just where discourse is now. And you see a real desire for it on the left, too. Look at all the excitement around \"Dark Brandon\" and Walz coining \"weird\" as a general sentiment around the far right that seemed to have a bit of momentum going until apparently someone told him to knock it off and he seemed super agreeable with Vance all night at the debate.\n\n\nAnd you're free to disagree with me, and I'd love to be wrong, but I think it's gonna be a consistently losing battle as time goes on if the DNC doesn't put forth a Trump of their own who is willing to just be crass and call people liars to their faces and not be afraid to just say stuff and handwave off any requests for proof or clarification. I mean, imagine someone who goes onstage and calls the ceo of a company a jerkoff for doing layoffs right after massive stock buybacks. And it seems fairly obvious that this person doesn't even have to be a true everyman. Trump lived in NYC in a big gold tower with his name on the top. He is, objectively, the most coastal elite theres ever been. But people relate to him somehow and disregard they stuff they don't like about him, and that's powerful.\n\n\nPeople will say that they don't want to see the dems go low like that, but I just gotta ask: do you ever want to win an election again? The DNC seems to just be waiting for another Obama to fall from the sky. Another super skilled debater who is almost maddeningly cool and confident and is really good at inspiring people. But I just don't think we're gonna get that person if the DNC keeps insisting on putting forth candidates who really seem to lack the fiery conviction and anger that Americans seem to really crave in these modern times.",

         "Seriously, even our 3rd parties are disastrous",
         "I think Covid drove a lot of people to the polls for Biden, people were tired of lockdowns and Covid spreading under trumps lack of ability to handle anything serious. More people came out to vote because they couldn\u2019t go out and party and travel like they used to. They were willing to get off their disinterested and politically illiterate butts to vote for Biden in the hopes he would be more competent and they could go back to having fun.\n\nIt was a driving and singular incentive that unified large groups of people who otherwise don\u2019t care about politics or voting.",
         "I didn\u2019t say how they would vote at all. And yea, we\u2019ve always had minority rule. It\u2019s not so long ago that to vote you needed to own land and be a man.

         "1)It was never about whether or not her plan was better than his. Neither party was really going to capture the other\u2019s base. If anything, given the number of voters that said they were not better off than they were in 2020, she needed to differentiate her plan from Biden\u2019s.\n\n2)Most people aren\u2019t going and reading the details. Let\u2019s be honest, a lot of people wouldn\u2019t get it- not saying they aren\u2019t smart enough but we all have educational or contextual blind spots make it difficult to understand one subject or another. They don\u2019t need the candidate to explain it all to them, but they do need the candidate to make them comfortable with it. She didn\u2019t do that. The top issue for her voters was preserving democracy by a long shot. She prosecuted that case successfully for those voters. Economy, Civil liberties, foreign policy she didn\u2019t so for the voters that cared most about these things stayed home.",

         "If people do not vote, it is because there is not a choice that benefits them. That means that the candidate did not do their job properly. It\u2019s very simple really.

It felt like something was taking over America and it was in plain sight in design.\n\nSure I don\u2019t feel like Trump makes all the decisions at all but for damn sure the other side is in COMPLETE  DESIGN and it is TERRIFYING.

         "I encourage people to research this themselves, it can be difficult to find the right answer. But the major reason why we have an increase in chronic illnesses and issues like asthma, ADHD, and sickly children is not what you might think. The US spends a significant amount more on healthcare per person than the world average, why is that? a lot of our food is processed. Yes, but obesity is not the main issue. The Democratic Party platform puts a lot of funding into healthcare, this is not bad. We should care about our health, mental and physical. The democratic Party wants us to believe that they care about us, but they are not addressing the core issue by putting more spending into healthcare. Why are people more sick than decades before? I find I have very bad digestive issues, and I always attributed it to my father, who also had bad digestion, but what I am finding is, the less processed food I eat the better my digestion gets. A lot of the things that we put in our food causes developmental problems in children, and then his passed on to the next generation, it\u2019s a vicious cycle. you can disagree with RFK Junior, but, he does point out the core issue of why we spend more on healthcare. It\u2019s because of the stuff we put in our food. And the one that regulates that is the FDA. Ask yourself, who benefits from a lack of laws preventing processed food dyes in our food if they cause long-term health problems (assuming they do)? The medical and food industries. Because they can sell us products that are cheaper, but are ultimately bad for our health. It takes a lot to change out ingredients in your food at the manufacturing level and the product level. If we are indeed, being poisoned by our own food, what benefit would the medical industry get from it? You guessed it, more medical treatment that cost more than he can afford. on a personal level, I\u2019m excited to see my health improved because I do not consume things that are heavily processed, and have food coloring in them that cause long-term health problems. I can feel day today if I have eaten crap or not and it\u2019s really interesting to see my mood/mental health/energy All get better one day at a time. Vaccines are bad? I would not agree with that, but our food being poisoned\u2026 I finally accept that. I will say, though, I friend of mine, who had 4\u20135 kids was heavily against vaccines. She doesn\u2019t think they are Il or anything religious but, she did not give vaccines to her kids. What she did do, was feed them anything that was not processed, and did not have food coloring in it. Metabolically, health wise and mental health wise\u2026 four out of five of her kids are very solid, one is mentally unstable here and there. don\u2019t agree that vaccines are bad, but it\u2019s hard to deny a real example in front of my eyes where vaccines weren\u2019t used, and the children did not end up sickly\u2026 assuming their diets were well-maintained like her kids were.",

Enough people were vaccinated and we had so much less contact that nobody could actually catch it anymore. Type 1 polio is the one that is most likely to cause paralysis too. \n\nHow much better do you think the healthcare system has to be in order to make up for what we already lack, let alone accommodating the resurgence of a deadly and crippling disease that we have been *so* close to getting rid of worldwide? We still have Covid consequences fresh in our minds and affecting many people still. I just cannot fathom how someone can so easily say what you\u2019ve just claimed, despite all of the troves of information we have at our fingertips that says otherwise. It\u2019s irresponsible and dangerous. My only hope is that it won\u2019t even turn out this bad because republicans won\u2019t be able to be so stupid as to keep going with their insane policies once the consequences start. Or that somehow it won\u2019t last long because some people with sense with knock them on the head with reality.",

This seems to be the segment that Trump captured.\nI am not convinced that people making $25,000 a year will bear the inflationary brunt of additional tariffs on, say, solar panels and EV batteries (tariffs that the current administration just increased in September). \nIt seems likely that Trump\u2019s across-the-board tariff promise was for election purposes rather than a fundamental economic policy. The stock market rise today reflects this. \nWith targeted tariffs, domestic prices may increase for related products, but there are also more employment opportunities with domestic manufacturers. Consider the higher price for solar panels as a transfer payment to those 25%who were \u201cfunctionally unemployed\u201d but now have more employment opportunities.

         "I mean, because banks want to be paid for the risk they incur on their assets. If new builds are reduced because of, say, massive tariffs causing supplies to skyrocket in price, then banks will see fewer new mortgage applications - and therefore less new business. \n\nThen there is the possibility of tariffs burdening Americans to the point that they can't pay their existing mortgages, even with a fixed rate, which means higher rates of defaults. They can hedge against that risk by raising the mortgage rates.",
         "Prices will go up. Because somebody has to pay the tariff / cost of producing at home. This means inflation, and to stop inflation interest rates go up. This is the very short version.",
         "That's short term. Mortgage rates are most closely tied to 10 year treasuries (due to amortization, early payments and avg time before refinance).

And this is compared to Trump, the literal only politician I have ever heard of who makes a habit of leaving interviews early when he doesn't like the questions.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nAlso, who cares about the teleprompter? She is careful about what she says, which is arguably important for a politician, whereas rambling off the cuff is something that arguably should never occur in public during a presidency. She gave plenty of interviews that gave a glimpse into how she thinks, they just weren't specifically on Joe Rogan",
         "So voter turnout is unchangeable. Got it.",
         "It's maddening.",
         "Doesn't mean vance has to fill the spot..he was never sworn in, so he is not yet in the position to step up. Thatd be a whole array of things to have happen. So what REALLY needs done is Biden steps down immediately, Kamala becomes #47 and signs into law that felons can't be president and then she will stay in the seat while the law figures out who takes the spot.",
         "I didn't say overturn the election. But can def EO a bunch of missed agenda points into place.",
         "Clearly it worked for Trump, so why not?",
         "Worked for the felon you voted for didn't it?",
         "I have no idea which interview you're referring to. But I do know of Trump backing out of 60 minutes, I know of him leaving the Association of Black Journalists interview, I know of him leaving lots and lots of interviews because they ask him tough questions. But none of those incidents had any effect on the voters you're talking about.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nAlso her interviews aren't \"scripted\". The reason she \"knew the questions in advance\" is because it literally was her job and her teams job to practice media appearances. She practiced. And the questions were all predictable because they're the questions every politician gets asked.\u00a0 And the fact that she practiced her media appearances is an objectively good thing.",
         "So.. you think now that Trump was elected, Israel is going to stop killing Palestinians?",
         "Well now Kushner is going to turn into waterfront properties after Trump \u201cfinishes the job.\u201d",
         "I feel really bad for people who re-elected an administration that has supported genocide.\n\nPeople have to live with that for the rest of their lives. Knowing that there was a genocide, mostly women and children, happening right now, and they voted for it. Really sad.",

         "That, and wages were outpacing inflation of consumer goods.",
         "Yeah, everything related to covid was Trump\u2019s fault! Except the parts that happened under Biden, that was Covid\u2019s fault!",
         "*cough* Bernie Sanders?",
         "Agreed. Republicans win two important camps: The deplorables and the people who just want to make more money at their stable job every year, and to not suffer bankruptcy and destitution. There is no moral or social issue that can sway that second group, because they don't look beyond themselves when voting.\n\nThe former are not worth appealing to but Bernie has been able to capture the latter in the past.",
         "Then you have no idea what the working class wants.",
         "Fuck me. AOC is perhaps the farthest left official in congress. What's far left to you lmao?\n\nSomeone like Tulsi Gabbard, Whitmer are electable and could very feasibly win an election. It's not about their gender, it's about being shit candidates. Very simple.",
         "Newsom would be great but good luck convincing other parts of the country that a successful California governor who is actually intelligent and could share some of that success with the nation is a good idea. Kamala already ran circles around Trump for everyone to see. Trump literally spent rallies swaying to music he\u2019s not authorized to play and get sued for, fellate a microphone, etc. Conservatives don\u2019t care. Undecideds don\u2019t pay enough attention and are easily swayed by propaganda. This country is a mess and I don\u2019t see how that will change anytime soon.",
         "Newsom will never be president. Have you been paying attention to what is happening in California? This may come as a shock to you, but the overwhelming majority of the population is moderate. Dems need to elect someone from the heart of the country.",
         "Your guy won, amd yet you still choose to behave this way. You have power--or at least your preferred candidate does--yet somehow you both lack dignity. Sad.",
         "Have fun losing even more elections.",
         "It applies to both. And you should try to be better than the people you criticize.",
         "The US population is expected to start declining in the second half of this century. I studied this in my econ and marketing classes. Eventually social security will be unsustainable as the population ages and declining birth rates meaning less people paying in.\n\nBut to the point of Trump, no he's a big fan of social security and has gone against other Republicans who wanted to reform it.",
         "Keep it coming! Daddys thirsty!",
         "\u201cSheep filled with hate\u201d then immediately proceeds to say those same people have no brain cells. Never change, democrats. Never change.",
         "Why are you answering questions about other people\u2019s retirement like you know?",
         "I saw a lot more targeted propaganda coming from the mainstream media that almost completely supported Kamala. As well as big tech and pretty much all A list celebrities",
         "Oh no, they may have won all 3 branches but the Whole World^TM is still after them.",
         "Man these snowflakes really cried a lot for the last 4 years",
         "See also: Florida",
         "Yes, it was. Learn some empathy for who? The group of driveling morons that partook in the hivemind of this sub? Because why? Their pookie Kamala lost in a landslide? Not gonna happen.",
         "What protections do I have?",
         "clarify for us! what party? ;)",
         "Okay you can write as much as you want, it doesn't change the fact that the military weren't involved on Jan 6th",
         "I\u2019m very in tune with her interviews, but the point is Joe Rogan is a moderate who typically leans left on most issues. It would\u2019ve given her a shot to reach an audience outside the echo chamber. Only now has he come out and endorsed Trump (someone who also historically leans left) because the clear demonization of Trump by all the media, Hollywood, and nearly every major organization is glaring and tells you something. Also, because she wouldn\u2019t just agree to an interview at Joe Rogans studio as every other interview he\u2019s done has been. All of her other interviews are with organizations who are a part of the Trump-is-Hitler camp. Anytime she gets asked a \u201chard\u201d question she deflects to talk about Trump. Her saying \u201cI\u2019m not Joe Biden, and I\u2019m not trump either\u201d is about as much insight as she gave. Not convincing, not someone people feel would represent them. Maybe that\u2019s the difference is I would prefer someone less polished but minimal BS, and you\u2019re good with the BS as long as it\u2019s said eloquently.",
         "Great idea I\u2019m sure Mike Johnson would have that bill on her desk within the week. Doesn\u2019t he know our democracy is at stake!?!?",
         "Yeah like he did with student loan forgiveness.",
         "Are you aspiring to be Trump?",
         "It worked for Trump because he is honest in who and what he is.\n\n\nIt doesn't work for Democrats because they claim to be morally and intellectually superior while doing the same shit.\n\n\nLook at all the Democrats wishing ill on minorities for voting against them in all of these threads. Democrats look like hypocrites, like they did when they overtly told us to ignore a genocide to protect their electorability. Or when they lied about the mental acuity of an 82 year old man, only to force him out and appoint a successor without a primary, to \"save democracy.\"\u00a0\n\n\nPeople don't actually care that you insult them. It turns people off because of the hypocrisy and double standard.",
         "Yeah for both the electoral college and the popular vote. keep whining tho!",
         "Well first off, I'm not a republican and I didn't vote for Trump. But if you want to act like Trump, then you do you",
         "Oh, thanks",
         "I know they are. The fetus is expelled naturally or reabsorbed by the body in half of all pregnancies, mostly without women evening realizing they are pregnant. That is a fact. Why is this \u201ccompassion\u201d for fetuses only applied to strategically to pregnancy terminations that involved a woman exercising her agency?",
         "You are aware that government spending was dramatically higher under Trump than Biden, yes?\n\nJust kidding, we all know you aren't aware.",
         "They want help which the current iteration of the Democratic Party is not interested in providing",
         "\"Furthest left\" and \"far left\" would be an example of a \"relative\" and \"absolute\" position on the political spectrum. Somewhere in government there is an R that is the \"furthest left\". Does that make them on the left?",
         "Worked for Reagan but he was an R",
         "Which tells you what a terrible candidate Kamala was",
         "These are the people in the country who elected them. No concept of what is actually going on, many too hateful and bigoted but will say \u201cthe economy\u201d when presented their reasoning, and sore winners and losers.",
         "Funny, we won the last 3 in a row. You win one and all of a sudden it\u2019s because we didn\u2019t reach across the aisle to appeal to racist dipshits. Which has never worked in the past. Couldn\u2019t be anything else.",
         "Taking the high road and hoping for unity was a nice sentiment but it doesn\u2019t win elections as we\u2019ve learned. \n\nFrom now on the blame for every broken promise Trump fails to keep as President needs to placed on the people that put him there and I plan on reminding them often.",
         "Its quite vexing to hear that when Trump himself along with his most vocal supporters do not at all try to be better or take any high road.",
         "Edgy. You\u2019re so cool",
         "In these exchanges, y\u2019all never criticize the offending post\u2014just the people criticizing it. \n\nNever change, conservatives, never change",
         "Why are asking me a question like I have any obligation to answer you?",
         "They\u2019ll still find something to cry about",
         "This is why we hate you. MAGA is garbage and we\u2019re going to treat you like garbage.",
         "People dying left and right was a better time?",
         "Las trump was elected, he wrecked the country so bad we voted for Joe Biden. \n\nUnder trump we had incredible high inflation and the highest unemployment in recent history. \n\nHe said he had a healthcare plan and the burners were full of blank papers",
         "\"The mob is the mother of tyrants\"\n\nIsn't it amazimg how people will try and justify the actions of far right no matter what.\n\nYet anyone whom they regard as being vaguely liberal and honest is viewed with complete contempt.\n\nIt's fine for a load of rednecks to stage an attempted coup.\n\nBut imagine if they had been from the middle East or the left of politics.\n\nEvery one of them would have been shot and put down.\n\nThat's it. My contempt for Trump and his sycophants knows no bounds. I deplore extremism.",
         "Absolutely not.",
         ">Yeah for both the electoral college and the popular vote.\n\nYeah just like last time in 2020, and you guys whined for 4 years straight and stormed a freaking building. But we'll be the bigger person this time",
         "Well sorry for calling you one of them, but I will indeed do me",
         "That is hilarious. Where are you getting these numbers from?",
         "It\u2019s frankly astonishing that so much of the country thinks that a powerhouse state like California which subsidizes so many others is a \u201cfailed state.\u201d",
         "DNC needs to go scorched earth on themselves and admit defeat. It\u2019s time for new blood in power. They need to be uncompromising and not show anything that can be mistaken for softness. Kamala lost because too many people in this country think buffoonery, lies, and threats are a sign of strength. Show them what it really means to be strong and stop kowtowing to the establishment politicians who will never appeal to the undecideds.",
         "The last 3? What?",
         "That's why you have to present yourself as an alternative, not more of the same.",
         "I\u2019m edgy for quoting your hypocrisy?",
         "Y\u2019all are so hateful. Womp womp",
         "Enjoy the next 4 years buddy",
         "Still gullible as ever I see",
         "Sure sounds like it \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",
         "Then get used to these type of results in the future",
         "Yeah, that will work. \ud83d\ude02",
         "Popular vote?  But if that were what they were describing it's the last 4, not 3.  This is the first time a Republican has won the popular vote since W. in 2004.",
         "Yes, see, in America we have these things call\nmidterms. The three elections since 2016 have all been soundly won by Dems.",
         "The Democratic Party needs to do that. Not us as individuals. I can debate policies and what I agree with or oppose but that's not going matter without a real candidate proposing said alternatives. \n\nYes I agree we need a candidate who isn't just \"I am not as bad as Trump or [Insert Candidate Here]\". Hopefully 2028 can get us there. \n\nJust sucks to see Trump win but ultimately the reaction will be far less severe on our end compared to the reaction of Trump supporters back in 2020.",
         "How is it hypocritical to say people can be filled with hate and stupid at the same time?",
         "You're saying people didn't die from Covid at high rates?",
         "We got these results because we've been playing by rules that the other side no longer plays by, and by trying to always take the high road like you're doing. Go in peace.",
         "No, I was talking about the 2 midterms and presidential election since 2016.",
         "True. I don't know why I was thinking 2022 had Republican majority. Maybe because of the Roe v Wade fiasco.",
         "You are filled with hatred for the other side, just as they are filled with hate for you. You\u2019re a pot calling the kettle black.",
         "From covid? No. With covid? Yes.",
         "Dems are out of touch. That's why Harris lost. Until Dems come to terms with that fact and do something to reverse it, the GoP will end up running the country long after Trump is gone. If you think acting like Trump is the key to victory, then you are sadly mistaken."

Under Project 2025, the newly named Department of Life would be required to take a \u201cbiblically based\u201d stance that families consist of a married mother and father, and the agency would make it easier for religious adoption and foster care services to refuse to work with LGBTQ+ couples. The plan also takes aim at various legal precedents and policies that have protected and expanded LGBTQ+ rights over the last decade. Project 2025 recommends reversing the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Bostock v. Clayton County, which protects LGBTQ+ people from workplace discrimination and has served as the foundation for cases involving gender identity. It further supports eliminating the promotion of gender-affirming care for minors nationwide.\nSeveral states have enacted policies that provide a glimpse of what Project 2025 would look like on the national level. In Texas, one city recently banned trans people from using public restrooms that don\u2019t match the sex assigned to them at birth, and the state\u2019s attorney general has sued two doctors who provide pediatric trans health care. Several other states have made it nearly impossible for trans people to update their gender marker on driver\u2019s licenses or birth certificates, and the future of gender-affirming care for all people rests upon an upcoming Supreme Court challenge of a Tennessee law. Legal experts have warned that Trump\u2019s victory, and a conservative-leaning Supreme Court, could mean few roadblocks to stop him from making Project 2025\u2019s vision of torching civil liberties of LGBTQ+ people into a reality.\u201d",

The dude was nuts in many ways.\n\nAnyway fun anecdotes aside the most common usage of this term now isn\u2019t some hot take down of sexism. It\u2019s basically a meme started by drag queens.

Even if you\u2019re on their side and disagree on an issue or two, they immediately turn to name calling and insults.  \n\nAt the local level, I happily vote for a lot of our Dem candidates.

You have to be a \u201cdumbass\u201d to not see it for what it is.\n\nYour comment regarding equating genuine medical use with voluntary use is just patently stupid. Even in some very liberal countries, the use of puberty blockers as treatment for trans teens has ceased. The data is just not there to conclusively prove that this should be the standard treatment method.\n\nI can assure you that there are many doctors who believe that this puberty blocker thing is absolute insanity. Case in point, my aunt is a retired pediatrician who specialized in reproductive development and growth disorders. She voted for Harris. But, this is one of the issues she vehemently disagrees with the Democrats on. But I guess she is just a dumbass, right?",
         "No, it did, there was polling on it.\n\nIf you are OK with that, I guess keep doing the same thing.\n\nIt is clear that the activists have done far more harm than good, upending a long-term trend of greater acceptance.  This is likely because of silly positions on female sports, school excesses, and the constant emotional-blackmail about children leading to a massive uptick in sterilization.\n\nMeanwhile, regular trans adults have to watch acceptance roll back because certain male athletes decided they were super special and got to compete against females.  We see how that is working out for regular trans people...",

         "No but it is all written in an agenda you have. An agenda made by an organization that help draft over 60% of the last Trump administrations bills.",
         "It's all they know",
         "Because of federalism. Besides the federal government, the next highest power in the land is held with the state. That\u2019s what allows 50 semi independent entities to operate as a single country.",
         "I don\u2019t think they have the votes for that.",
         "It is up to the people, they vote in state elections",
         "The people vote in the states. Thats how these states have been adding abortion protections. If anything, keeping it in the Supreme Court was keeping it away from the people.",
         "Haha ok! Trump university grad! \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude4c",
         "This is what I don\u2019t understand. For all the stories and bashing of Biden on his age and his cognitive ability, Trump is every bit as worse. But no one really seems to care",
         "That they united behind their geriatric moron and we didn\u2019t.",
         "I literally can't make it any clearer. The Democrat campaign was an absolute shambles from beginning to end. For all that Trump is a despicable old asshole, people know what Trumpism is and how it relates to them. What the fuck was Kamala even for?\u00a0",
         "No, I'm not mad. Just disappointed. It's clear that this is what America wants yet it's hard to believe that the majority of US chose to vote against their own self-interests when a little bit of hate and fear was dangled in front of them.",
         "Dawg ur worried about $20 cash back on an Amex. There isn't a single trump policy that is going to benefit you.",
         "lol just speaking your language \ud83e\udd70",
         "I did give it a \u201csorry for you, dork\u201d upvote tho (*though!!!!) because you seem like ya (*you!!!) really want it. Yr welcome lol",
         "Property taxes need to go too. Fuck being taxed out of a house you paid for.",
         "What better way is there to ensure you stay in power other than remove any barriers to prevent you from deciding who exactly can vote? Regardless of the makeup of either party today, tomorrow they could be entirely different.",
         "Don't forget no fault divorce. The thing that saved the lives of many men and women over the last few decades.",
         "Where's the source for that then? What courts? The supreme court is doing no such thing.",
         "Why should the states decide it and not cities? why not towns? or neighborhoods? or\u2026 INDIVIDUALS. \n\nWhy should personal decision be decided by you and your buddies. You know nothing about me, my situation, or my choices. Yet you get to vote to limit the healthcare I get to receive?",
         "That remains to be seen but they will introducing the legislation.",
         "Nonsense, people were able to make their choice no matter where they live, now that some states have banned it, they can no longer make their choice because the state took it away",
         "So why were people able to make their choice until the Supreme Court over turned it. Now people in some states can\u2019t make the choice because those states have banned it.",
         "He was told he needed to step down, he did, and people are still angry and him and Kamala. No reasoning with these folk.",
         "Democrats have a circular firing squad when they lose. Republicans say Democrats cheated when they lose. I can\u2019t make that any clearer.",
         "Oh no! God forbid I take advantage of a card benefit that I pay $375 annually for.\n\nPretty \"weird\" of you to bring that up though.",
         "States decide their own laws, yes? You\u2019re making an argument that a state shouldn\u2019t be able to make any law it seems. \n\nWell, the state can also make illegal for you to not wear your seatbelt for instance. I really don\u2019t think your argument works here. Laws limit plenty of behaviors. Abortion is not black and white and it has the (at least argued) implication of ending another human\u2019s life.",
         "I\u2019ve not heard of that yet, but they wouldn\u2019t even have full republican support for that. It\u2019s not like they have a 60 seat senate majority. They have what, 52? That\u2019s not enough",
         "What they meant was, it's up to OTHER people lol",
         "Well ya that's how it works. Some states do this some do that. You can vote to change it or to leave to another state",
         "The people didn\u2019t make their choice on whether it was legal or not back then. It was mandated to be legal by a court of 9 justices. Thats not a decision made by the people on its legality.",
         "What moron chooses to pay a yearly fee to get a credit card with benefits, when most banks provide that at no charge.",
         "Not sure how that's weird I'm making a point to laugh at ur stupidity. I believe the path forward for the left is by bringing back bullying and ridicule. It worked for trump. You use an Amex. You are not rich. You will never be rich. Trumps economic policies will not help you.",
         "I\u2019m making the same argument you are. If federal decisions are too broad, why aren\u2019t state decisions considered the same? The country isn\u2019t uniform, but neither are state, nor are towns, nor are neighborhoods, nor are individuals. \n\nYou need to make a real argument for why states are better that doesn\u2019t reference the diversity of electorate across the nation because that falls under the simplest of scrutinies.",
         "They only need 50. The filibuster can be removed with a simple majority vote. The filibuster is a chamber rule, not written into law or the constitution.",
         "The people who don\u2019t believe government should decide for the people want the government to decide for the people. This was the same argument they had for slavery.",
         "No they made their choice on getting an abortion or not, the states took that choice away",
         "Most bank credit cards have tiers, with the free option providing next to no benefits beyond the basic functionality of a credit card.",
         "Because federal decisions are informed by the constitution. Decisions outside of that fall to the state. That is the designed balance of power between the federal and state governments in regard to decision making. It\u2019s not an argument I need to make, it\u2019s literally just how our system is made up.",
         "I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s true, think it would still need 60",
         "I mean, you basically have two sides - one side believes that the government should have control over citizen's bodies, and the other believes that citizens themselves should be able to make decisions about their own bodies. It's not really about slavery lol",
         "Some states allow abortion at will. Some states restrict abortion. Laws restrict behavior, that is correct. But the laws in place on a state level are decided by the people.",
         "So we\u2019re just going to ignore the second part of the 10th amendment where it says \u201cthe rights are  reserved to the states, OR TO THE PEOPLE\u201d\n\nNarrow definition to fit your narrative seems a little fucked, no?",
         "No, it is. Which is why it was insane democrats didn't do it to protect voting rights.",
         "Just stop it",
         "Correct. The people can decide on a state level.",
         "It isn\u2019t. Even to remove the filibuster I believe it would still have to survive (wait for it) the filibuster. It would need 60. Which voting rights?",
         "That\u2019s not a good argument."
