         "Personally I think we are all seeing four things in the USA which coalesce into a Republican stranglehold.  All of which have been stated before but not compounding each other.\n\n**1. Flooding the endzone**\n\nIt is clear that Western democratic states are now completely *saturated* in misinformation, astroturfing and propaganda. It's been well documented but it's likely we have not even scratched the surface of the true extent.  Foreign states, non-state actors, special interest groups; the general populace is absolutely *drenched* in a non-stop torrent of misleading information.  It's inescapable.  It infects every facet of our life.  And if you avoid it or limit it, you have to deal with co-workers or family members who do not.  It exhausts critical evaluation and political discussion...which is the point.  One one hand you feed a dizzying spectacle of non-stop content poisoned with nonsense and on the other you serve a buffet of bread and circus.\n\n**2.  The Overton Window has shifted**\n\nWe are undeniably moving towards a far-right autocratic world, not just in the USA but in other nations as well.  Previously unthinkable rhetoric is now acceptable.  Everything from marginalised groups to disability to misogyny to tax evasion; our cultural political norms are almost totally broken.\n\nThese two combined have yielded apathy in those we need to vote most and outrage in those most likely to vote for right-wing parties.\n\n**3.**  **Established voter groups can no longer be predicted**.\n\nFor instance - *The Republican's gains with nonwhites was particularly acute among Hispanic and Latino voters. Democrats' vote margin with the group fell by 26 points, according to the exit poll, to just a 53-percent-to-45-percent margin.* ***Trump's vote share with Latinos looks like it could be the best since George W. Bush's***\u00a0[***44 percent***](https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/how-groups-voted-2004)\u00a0***in 2004. Latino men moved 33 points toward Trump, one of his biggest swings.***  We may have to confront that misogyny plays a real part in US culture.\n\n**4.  The Democratic Party, much like left-wing parties in other Western nations, have almost completely abandoned their historical roots and now only compete on centre-right policies.**\n\nHistorical left wing initiatives like the New Deal or the NHS in the UK are completely unthinkable.    This serves to only embolden the right-wing.  They can argue on the strength of right-wing ideas versus right-wing *lite* rather than right v left.\n\n**The Risk**...\n\nThe tell-tale signs of societal erosion are all around us right now.  Lest anyone be confused; the real risk from Donald Trump is not that he will create internment camps etc.  The USA still has enough checks and balances still remaining.\n\nThe terrifying risk is 4 years of financial deregulation which will lead to an untold financial nuclear bomb the likes of which we cannot even imagine at present.\n\nIf you want an insight into his running of a government then check out Michael Lewis: ***The Fifth Risk***. Terrifying.\n\nAlso, if you want to understand how your neighbour or your family or your friend ended up voting for Trump then check out ***Origins of Totalitarianism*** by Hannah Arendt.  Possibly the most important book of the 20th Century, more so today than ever.\n\nIf you want to know why regular people would support monstrous policies - check out ***They Thought They Were Free:  Germans 1933-1945***.   Illuminating.",
         "Yesterday I went into a restaurant and there was a table of 8 or 9 women. They were all dressed in red dresses, with MAGA hats on.  They had not one, but two life size(height wise) cardboard cut outs of Trump at the table with them.  \nI just can't believe in this day and age, with what we know of Trump's character, that they would publicly brag about their support for him.",
         "The worst part is when thing go south. Which they will. All his supporters will run off and not take responsibility. That\u2019s the most annoying part Everytime this happens historically.",
         "15,000,000 Democrats who voted in 2020 simply didn't show up to vote in 2024.  Those people sealed the fate of what's coming next.\n\nTrump got 3,000,000 less votes.  People didn't go red.  Third party votes were minimal, so they didn't go that way either.  Nope.  They just didn't show up.\n\nWhat a dumb way to absolutely screw an entire country.\n\nThis was not an election of politics.  It wasn't about parties or candidates this time.  This was saving the government from what's now going to happen next.\n\nThis fucking sucks, and we are now not the ones able to save this institution.\n\nThe dumb part is the federal government needs to protect itself through policy or force form what is coming to dismantle it from the inside out.\n\nTrump I don't even worry about.  He can be president for 4 years, and those 4 years is a mess and infective.  It's not even about Trump this time.  It's about Vance, Thiel, project 2025, and the systematic replacement of all appointable people and then all the appointees firing and replacing everyone they can, and then those new hires firing and replacing everyone they can.  This was Vance's own words pretty much day stating this. His plan is to replace everyone he possibly can. And it will be people who don't have your interest nor the government's interest at heart.  The word coup isn't a light word to use, but this is the best descriptor of what happens next.  \n\nAnd the leadership? Trump was just the tool to get votes.  His job is done.  He's now dead weight and I highly suspect we'll see his forceful removal, not by Democrats, but by Republicans. Then Vance becomes president, not by vote but by placement.  Vance is no leader either, but...he's an exceptional puppet. Of whom? Thiel who backed him, threw cash at Trump and the Republican party to place with the dependency of placing Vance as VP.  Thiel and others just bought the presidency.  And now all it takes is the removal of Trump. You didn't vote for Vance.  It was not earned, not democratic.  Good position was bought.  And his goal is to be president, like right now of he could.  And then Thiel starts pulling those strings making that puppet dance.  And you'll start seeing president Vance systematically destroy the federal government as we know it. I don't even care about most of project 2025 at this point. It's the systematic removal of people, destroying or permanently disabling federal agencies, having corporate yes men in those agencies who don't act for the department but Thiel and the ultra wealthy.  EPA, FDA, USPS, DOJ, every department, all of them, will be mutilated.\n\nHere's the real problem.  You can't fix this after. This damage is permanent.  The federal government as we know it is fucked. Period. That's what's coming next.\n\nAnd I hope I'm wrong.  I hope this isn't the reality that's coming.  But everything points to it.  And of it does play out, our nation is fucked, proper fucked.\n\nThis wasn't an election of party.  It was risk mitigation, and the risk of this happening is non zero. And this non zero ends democracy and turns this government into a puppet regime. This non zero is what a coup looks like. And I so very much hope it doesn't happen. You know when it starts, when it really starts, when you see Republicans vote to remove Trump too and you see no residence to Vance and the sea of replacements.  That's the end point of any means to stopping this. Then welcome to a new America. It has no Biden, no Harris, no Trump, no one you recognize nor voted for.  You are no longer part of the game.  This is no longer a democracy.  This nation ends.\n\nThis nation ends.\n\nAnd 15,000,000 stayed at home and made this non zero risk happen.\n\nAll we do now is wait and see if it happens.",

This is achieved by impersonating membership of that same group and astroturfing communities in a procedural and calculated manner using thousands of coordinated accounts.\n\nTrump\u2019s blatant indicators of compromise from the Russian government, in combination with this policy, results in a digital ecosystem without checks or measures toward preventing this interference from occurring again and again. The social media platforms that were leveraged to enable these coordinated efforts of manipulation to take place unrestricted, will, in combination with the lack of any democratic government entity that may have contributed toward the hindrance of this occurring, will have zero ability to prevent this mass interference on the world population from occurring going forward. This will serve to further cement the narrative on any political party or movement those same state entities choose to inject influence over via these online platforms for the foreseeable future.\n\nThere is massive precedent for a quid pro quo in this situation between the party benefiting solely from having the narrative crafted in their favour to influence the population deciding an election en-masse to get them elected; and the benefit to the state entity carrying out the mass interference on that same parties behalf. \n\nWith the guardrails removed and no ability for this to be combatted going forward, the flow of propaganda to an even greater extent and severity than anyone can comprehend, and the manipulation of every online discussion going forward, is inevitable. \n\nThe ignorance of the general population when it comes to their self-perceived ability to know when they are in contact with propaganda, in combination with a tsunami of unfettered manipulation delivered direct, means this may be the most danger democracy worldwide has ever faced. \n\nYour family, friends, colleagues, representatives are all exposed and vulnerable to this messaging. It results in a situation where they find themselves in the crosshairs of the policies of the party they are voting for. Simply due to their focus being on the hate, division and populist soundbites packaged alongside, instead of the policies themselves.\n\nDemocratic governments worldwide need recognise this as the end game, and take action to regulate the ability for these platforms to be leveraged, or they will quickly lose their ability to choose to do so.",

         "  \n\n\nwww.iwm.at\n\n20 Lessons from the 20th Century\n\nAuthor: Timothy Snyder\n\n  \n\n\nAmericans are no wiser than the Europeans who saw democracy yield to fascism, Nazism, or communism. Our one advantage is that we might learn from their experience. Now is a good time to do so. Here are twenty lessons from the twentieth century, adapted to the circumstances of today.\n\n  \n\n\n20 Lessons from the 20th Century\n\n  \n\n\n1. Do not obey in advance. Much of the power of authoritarianism is freely given. In times like these, individuals think ahead about what a more repressive government will want, and then start to do it without being asked. You\u2019ve already done this, haven\u2019t you? Stop. Anticipatory obedience teaches authorities what is possible and accelerates unfreedom.\n\n  \n\n\n2. Defend an institution. Follow the courts or the media, or a court or a newspaper. Do not speak of \u201cour institutions\u201d unless you are making them yours by acting on their behalf. Institutions don\u2019t protect themselves. They go down like dominoes unless each is defended from the beginning.\n\n  \n\n\n3. Recall professional ethics. When the leaders of state set a negative example, professional commitments to just practice become much more important. It is hard to break a rule-of-law state without lawyers, and it is hard to have show trials without judges.\n\n  \n\n\n4. When listening to politicians, distinguish certain words. Look out for the expansive use of \u201cterrorism\u201d and \u201cextremism.\u201d Be alive to the fatal notions of \u201cexception\u201d and \u201cemergency.\u201d Be angry about the treacherous use of patriotic vocabulary.\n\n  \n\n\n5. Be calm when the unthinkable arrives. When the terrorist attack comes, remember that all authoritarians at all times either await or plan such events in order to consolidate power. Think of the Reichstag fire. The sudden disaster that requires the end of the balance of power, the end of opposition parties, and so on, is the oldest trick in the Hitlerian book. Don\u2019t fall for it.\n\n  \n\n\n6. Be kind to our language. Avoid pronouncing the phrases everyone else does. Think up your own way of speaking, even if only to convey that thing you think everyone is saying. (Don\u2019t use the internet before bed. Charge your gadgets away from your bedroom, and read.) What to read? Perhaps \u201cThe Power of the Powerless\u201d by V\u00e1clav Havel, 1984 by George Orwell, The Captive Mind by Czes\u0142aw Milosz, The Rebel by Albert Camus, The Origins of Totalitarianism by Hannah Arendt, or Nothing is True and Everything is Possible by Peter Pomerantsev.\n\n  \n\n\n7. Stand out. Someone has to. It is easy, in words and deeds, to follow along. It can feel strange to do or say something different. But without that unease, there is no freedom. And the moment you set an example, the spell of the status quo is broken, and others will follow.\n\n  \n\n\n8. Believe in truth. To abandon facts is to abandon freedom. If nothing is true, then no one can criticize power, because there is no basis upon which to do so. If nothing is true, then all is spectacle. The biggest wallet pays for the most blinding lights.\n\n  \n\n\n9. Investigate. Figure things out for yourself. Spend more time with long articles. Subsidize investigative journalism by subscribing to print media. Realize that some of what is on your screen is there to harm you. Learn about sites that investigate foreign propaganda pushes.\n\n  \n\n\n10. Practice corporeal politics. Power wants your body softening in your chair and your emotions dissipating on the screen. Get outside. Put your body in unfamiliar places with unfamiliar people. Make new friends and march with them.\n\n  \n\n\n11. Make eye contact and small talk. This is not just polite. It is a way to stay in touch with your surroundings, break down unnecessary social barriers, and come to understand whom you should and should not trust. If we enter a culture of denunciation, you will want to know the psychological landscape of your daily life.\n\n  \n\n\n12. Take responsibility for the face of the world. Notice the swastikas and the other signs of hate. Do not look away and do not get used to them. Remove them yourself and set an example for others to do so.\n\n  \n\n\n13. Hinder the one-party state. The parties that took over states were once something else. They exploited a historical moment to make political life impossible for their rivals. Vote in local and state elections while you can.\n\n  \n\n\n14. Give regularly to good causes, if you can. Pick a charity and set up autopay. Then you will know that you have made a free choice that is supporting civil society helping others doing something good.\n\n  \n\n\n15. Establish a private life. Nastier rulers will use what they know about you to push you around. Scrub your computer of malware. Remember that email is skywriting. Consider using alternative forms of the internet, or simply using it less. Have personal exchanges in person. For the same reason, resolve any legal trouble. Authoritarianism works as a blackmail state, looking for the hook on which to hang you. Try not to have too many hooks.\n\n  \n\n\n16. Learn from others in other countries. Keep up your friendships abroad, or make new friends abroad. The present difficulties here are an element of a general trend. And no country is going to find a solution by itself. Make sure you and your family have passports.\n\n  \n\n\n17. Watch out for the paramilitaries. When the men with guns who have always claimed to be against the system start wearing uniforms and marching around with torches and pictures of a Leader, the end is nigh. When the pro-Leader paramilitary and the official police and military intermingle, the game is over.\n\n  \n\n\n18. Be reflective if you must be armed. If you carry a weapon in public service, God bless you and keep you. But know that evils of the past involved policemen and soldiers finding themselves, one day, doing irregular things. Be ready to say no. (If you do not know what this means, contact the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and ask about training in professional ethics.)\n\n  \n\n\n19. Be as courageous as you can. If none of us is prepared to die for freedom, then all of us will die in unfreedom.\n\n  \n\n\n20. Be a patriot. The incoming president is not. Set a good example of what America means for the generations to come. They will need it.\n\n  \n\n\nTimothy Snyder is the Bird White Housum Professor of History at Yale University and a Permanent Fellow at the IWM.\n\n  \n\n\n\u00a9 Author (2017)\n\n  \n\n\nThis is a short version, but it's also a book by the same name.\n\n  \n\n\nHere's the author in a lecture about the book: https://youtu.be/19IhRaWZUl4?si=ZBTjp4dRCssyfhYR",
         "You make an interesting case.  On one hand...I can see a lot of MAGA being upset if they are pushing Trump out.  However...you get Fox News backing the idea, suddenly \"Trump is unhinged, deranged, can't be trusted\" and MAGA starts NOW believing he is a threat, and Vance is the leader WE all need.  \n\nMy HOPE...is that depiste Republican majority in the senate and LIKELY the House...that there are enough democrats who will likely vote NO on particular laws/bills that get passed...that there are enough republicans who find a particular bill/law so egregious...and that they still have somewhat of a backbone that even they would vote NO, similar to the backbone McCain had. \n\nMaybe they get voted out in 2 years, but at least they did the right thing.",

America has been sold. You\u2019re very likely past the point where voting is going to do anything for you - at least in the near term. We\u2019ll see how things play out in the long term. I\u2019m very hopeful for a better future, but uh\u2026 this is different.",
         "Just so you\u2019re aware, there are over 7 million votes outstanding. Trump is going to beat his 2020 vote totals by at least a million and Kamala is going to go down by 6-7 million. What\u2019s crazy though is that these are votes that don\u2019t really matter for Kamala. There was record turnout in the places that matter (swing states). Trump just made up a LOT of ground in heavy Dem states and heavy Rep states (Texas and Florida were bigger blowouts for him than NY and Cali were for her and NJ is a legitimate swing state at this point).",

This is truly a historic moment we are living in and many people don't realize how much this will effect the course of this country and historians will be studying the rise and downfall of MAGA likely in 25 years or so.",

This is what Putin did in Russia and is replicating in the US. If you listen to everyday Russians they genuinely think that not caring about what the government decides is good for their litteral health. They say 'I'm not into politics otherwise I would be crazy.', etc.This logic is starting to be deployed in the US, hence the surge in mental health concerns we have had for one year or so. Absentees believe they are sparing themselves from depression and panic, but they have in fact been programmed to let autocrats seize and keep power.",

Our one advantage is that we might learn from their experience. Now is a good time to do so. Here are twenty lessons from the twentieth century, adapted to the circumstances of today.\n\n  \n\n\n20 Lessons from the 20th Century\n\n  \n\n\n1. Do not obey in advance. Much of the power of authoritarianism is freely given. In times like these, individuals think ahead about what a more repressive government will want, and then start to do it without being asked. You\u2019ve already done this, haven\u2019t you? Stop. Anticipatory obedience teaches authorities what is possible and accelerates unfreedom.\n\n  \n\n\n2. Defend an institution. Follow the courts or the media, or a court or a newspaper. Do not speak of \u201cour institutions\u201d unless you are making them yours by acting on their behalf. Institutions don\u2019t protect themselves. They go down like dominoes unless each is defended from the beginning.\n\n  \n\n\n3. Recall professional ethics. When the leaders of state set a negative example, professional commitments to just practice become much more important. It is hard to break a rule-of-law state without lawyers, and it is hard to have show trials without judges.\n\n  \n\n\n4. When listening to politicians, distinguish certain words. Look out for the expansive use of \u201cterrorism\u201d and \u201cextremism.\u201d Be alive to the fatal notions of \u201cexception\u201d and \u201cemergency.\u201d Be angry about the treacherous use of patriotic vocabulary.\n\n  \n\n\n5. Be calm when the unthinkable arrives. When the terrorist attack comes, remember that all authoritarians at all times either await or plan such events in order to consolidate power. Think of the Reichstag fire. The sudden disaster that requires the end of the balance of power, the end of opposition parties, and so on, is the oldest trick in the Hitlerian book. Don\u2019t fall for it.\n\n  \n\n\n6. Be kind to our language. Avoid pronouncing the phrases everyone else does. Think up your own way of speaking, even if only to convey that thing you think everyone is saying. (Don\u2019t use the internet before bed. Charge your gadgets away from your bedroom, and read.) What to read? Perhaps \u201cThe Power of the Powerless\u201d by V\u00e1clav Havel, 1984 by George Orwell, The Captive Mind by Czes\u0142aw Milosz, The Rebel by Albert Camus, The Origins of Totalitarianism by Hannah Arendt, or Nothing is True and Everything is Possible by Peter Pomerantsev.\n\n  \n\n\n7. Stand out. Someone has to. It is easy, in words and deeds, to follow along. It can feel strange to do or say something different. But without that unease, there is no freedom. And the moment you set an example, the spell of the status quo is broken, and others will follow.\n\n  \n\n\n8. Believe in truth. To abandon facts is to abandon freedom. If nothing is true, then no one can criticize power, because there is no basis upon which to do so. If nothing is true, then all is spectacle. The biggest wallet pays for the most blinding lights.\n\n  \n\n\n9. Investigate. Figure things out for yourself. Spend more time with long articles. Subsidize investigative journalism by subscribing to print media. Realize that some of what is on your screen is there to harm you. Learn about sites that investigate foreign propaganda pushes.\n\n  \n\n\n10. Practice corporeal politics. Power wants your body softening in your chair and your emotions dissipating on the screen. Get outside. Put your body in unfamiliar places with unfamiliar people. Make new friends and march with them.\n\n  \n\n\n11. Make eye contact and small talk. This is not just polite. It is a way to stay in touch with your surroundings, break down unnecessary social barriers, and come to understand whom you should and should not trust. If we enter a culture of denunciation, you will want to know the psychological landscape of your daily life.\n\n  \n\n\n12. Take responsibility for the face of the world. Notice the swastikas and the other signs of hate. Do not look away and do not get used to them. Remove them yourself and set an example for others to do so.\n\n  \n\n\n13. Hinder the one-party state. The parties that took over states were once something else. They exploited a historical moment to make political life impossible for their rivals. Vote in local and state elections while you can.\n\n  \n\n\n14. Give regularly to good causes, if you can. Pick a charity and set up autopay. Then you will know that you have made a free choice that is supporting civil society helping others doing something good.\n\n  \n\n\n15. Establish a private life. Nastier rulers will use what they know about you to push you around. Scrub your computer of malware. Remember that email is skywriting. Consider using alternative forms of the internet, or simply using it less. Have personal exchanges in person. For the same reason, resolve any legal trouble. Authoritarianism works as a blackmail state, looking for the hook on which to hang you. Try not to have too many hooks.\n\n  \n\n\n16. Learn from others in other countries. Keep up your friendships abroad, or make new friends abroad. The present difficulties here are an element of a general trend. And no country is going to find a solution by itself. Make sure you and your family have passports.\n\n  \n\n\n17. Watch out for the paramilitaries. When the men with guns who have always claimed to be against the system start wearing uniforms and marching around with torches and pictures of a Leader, the end is nigh. When the pro-Leader paramilitary and the official police and military intermingle, the game is over.\n\n  \n\n\n18. Be reflective if you must be armed. If you carry a weapon in public service, God bless you and keep you. But know that evils of the past involved policemen and soldiers finding themselves, one day, doing irregular things. Be ready to say no. (If you do not know what this means, contact the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and ask about training in professional ethics.)\n\n  \n\n\n19. Be as courageous as you can. If none of us is prepared to die for freedom, then all of us will die in unfreedom.\n\n  \n\n\n20. Be a patriot. The incoming president is not. Set a good example of what America means for the generations to come. They will need it.\n\n  \n\n\nTimothy Snyder is the Bird White Housum Professor of History at Yale University and a Permanent Fellow at the IWM.\n\n  \n\n\n\u00a9 Author (2017)\n\n  \n\n\nThis is a short version, but it's also a book by the same name.\n\n  \n\n\nHere's the author in a lecture about the book: https://youtu.be/19IhRaWZUl4?si=ZBTjp4dRCssyfhYR",

They have collaborated to suppress vital information on everything from elections to public health. **The censorship cartel must be dismantled and destroyed** \u2014 and it must happen immediately.   \n\n\n>\u00a0And I will begin the process of identifying and firing every federal bureaucrat who has engaged in domestic censorship\u2014directly or indirectly\u2014whether they are the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Health and Human Services, the FBI, the DOJ, no matter who they are.  \n\n\n>The federal government should immediately stop funding all non-profits and academic programs that support this authoritarian project. If any U.S. university is discovered to have engaged in censorship activities or election interferences in the past\u2014such as flagging social media content for removal \\[and\\] blacklisting\u2014those universities should lose federal research dollars and federal student loan support for a period of five years, and maybe more",

If they leave it alone they will maintain a relatively strong position by decoupling it as a \"national\" issue.",

It's not that there are less of us, but many will protest imperfect policy or an imperfect candidate by not voting, or voting for a third party instead \"to send a message.\"\n\nRepublicans \"pitch\" to white people, poor, working class, and lower middle class groups with little education, and sell anger toward \"others.\" Wealthier and more educated Republicans care more about their money than \"others\" so the anger works with them because \"I gots mine.\" This means they expect retribution and want \"a better economy\" at the expense of letting the world burn; they are more simple minded in this way so it's easier to fuck up as long as \"skyrocketing groceries and immigrants\" gets yelled about a lot. They vote consistently because they are consistently angry, so it looks like there are more of them.\n\n\nAlso, there are 161 million registered voters in the US. 72 million came out for Trump and friends which is 2 million less than 2020. This isn't half the country, it's 44%. Which means 56% of the country didn't support Trump enough to either vote for another party or sit out altogether. So less than half of the country wanted this.

Then you get some other Rich celebrity going \"I'm going to make your lives great, everythings going to be perfect, i'm going to do everything and fix everything \" they go \"well at least his stated agenda involves improving my situation\" so they vote for him.

She had to navigate between 'Joe is fine and capable' and 'he dropped out so I'm running'. It was an absolute 'gotcha' situation for Kamala. She wasn't just running against Trump, she was essentially running against her and Biden. Biden needed to not only step out but step down from the presidency, that is the only thing that would have put her in the position to be able to actually compete \n\nIn 4 years Democrats will have a much more competitive campaign, a fear based one. It will have a big dash of hope. I expect we will see something like 'the world is fucked up now but rise up because we have hope for a better future'.

Stay strong and for all who see this, take this person's advice about having a plan just in case.  Also, not a bad idea to start getting to know each others' neighbors and the people/ business owners around you.  One thing I've noticed with Republicans is that, as heartless and cruel they can be when it comes to those they have been conditioned to see as \"the other\", they often show sympathy and care for those they know personally or have direct relationships with.  That alone is an absolutely pathetic quality for them to show, only caring when they can put a face to those affected, but it may be the only way to prevent an all out \"cleansing\".",

This is achieved by impersonating membership of that same group and astroturfing communities in a procedural and calculated manner using thousands of coordinated accounts.\n\nTrump\u2019s blatant indicators of compromise from the Russian government, in combination with this policy, results in a digital ecosystem without checks or measures toward preventing this interference from occurring again and again. The social media platforms that were leveraged to enable these coordinated efforts of manipulation to take place unrestricted, will, in combination with the lack of any democratic government entity that may have contributed toward the hindrance of this occurring, will have zero ability to prevent this mass interference on the world population from occurring going forward. This will serve to further cement the narrative on any political party or movement those same state entities choose to inject influence over via these online platforms for the foreseeable future.\n\nThere is massive precedent for a quid pro quo in this situation between the party benefiting solely from having the narrative crafted in their favour to influence the population deciding an election en-masse to get them elected; and the benefit to the state entity carrying out the mass interference on that same parties behalf. \n\nWith the guardrails removed and no ability for this to be combatted going forward, the flow of propaganda to an even greater extent and severity than anyone can comprehend, and the manipulation of every online discussion going forward, is inevitable. \n\nThe ignorance of the general population when it comes to their self-perceived ability to know when they are in contact with propaganda, in combination with a tsunami of unfettered manipulation delivered direct, means this may be the most danger democracy worldwide has ever faced. \n\nYour family, friends, colleagues, representatives are all exposed and vulnerable to this messaging. It results in a situation where they find themselves in the crosshairs of the policies of the party they are voting for. Simply due to their focus being on the hate, division and populist soundbites packaged alongside, instead of the policies themselves.\n\nDemocratic governments worldwide need recognise this as the end game, and take action to regulate the ability for these platforms to be leveraged, or they will quickly lose their ability to choose to do so.",

When Trump's tariffs make life un-livable, taking away people's voting rights will be one way to ensure that they stay in power. The tariffs and mass deportations will tank the economy. Trump pledged to mass arrest his political opponents and hold military tribunals for them. He wants to arrest journalists. He wants to arrest citizens who donated to Democrats. He pledged to be a dictator and to use the military against people practicing their First Amendment rights. When all of that starts going down, we are all going to suffer.

They had a terrible strategy and dropped the ball so hard on so many occasions.\n\n* Biden dropped out at the last possible second, causing Democrats to skip having a primary, nominating someone that the people had zero say in, and who also did terribly in the 2020 primary\n* Democrats completely ignored the white and middle-class demographics, and especially men (as is evident by the post-election statistics)\n* Democrats delayed the prosecution of Donald Trump by 2-3 years, to try to force it during election season, thinking it would be an advantage. But it backfired spectacularly with Trump's delay tactics, combined with his cult of personality, plus the fact that he'd already stacked the courts with Republican judges.\n* I'm going to be perfectly bluntly honest here... but Democrats underestimated racism and sexism. I'm not saying this had a major impact, but it mathematically must have had SOME impact, where some people would not want to vote for a) a woman, b) a black person, and c) an indian person. Not voting for someone because of any one of these three reasons is obviously wrong, but I would be shocked if it wasn't a major factor for a significant number of voters.\n\nI'd like to point out btw, especially for that last bullet point, that these are not my personal feelings or beliefs.

         "My warning to people protesting in this manner: People have compared Trump to all sorts of dictators, but the closest I think I've seen to what we might get with Trump is Romania's Ceau\u0219escu. \n\nCeau\u0219escu was a communist who leveraged the Orthodox Church to gain power, create a cult of personality, institute a countrywide ban on abortion, and made Romania a worldwide center for child sex trafficking. He mismanaged and looted the treasury leading to massive national debt.\n\nQuoting\n\n> His secret police, the Securitate, was responsible for mass surveillance as well as severe repression and human rights abuses within the country, and controlled the media and press. Ceau\u0219escu's attempts to implement policies that [he hoped] would lead to a significant growth of the population, [instead his nationwide ban on abortion] led to an [increased maternal mortality rate about seven fold], and increased the number of orphans.... Economic mismanagement due to failed oil ventures during the 1970s led to very significant foreign debts for Romania. \n\nThe thing to note about Ceau\u0219escu and other paranoid, cult-leaders is that their goal is to wipe out opposition through police, physical violence, economic, political, media, ... as trump focuses on \"the enemy within\"\n\nExpect: Weaponized law enforcement and military actions in a response to goading you into protests to get you arrested/beaten, exhausting you financially, physically and wiped from the voting rolls. Ask the person who in encouraging you to protest \"and then what?\" and if the answer is \"we'll get noticed\" or \"raise awareness\" then that person is likely fallen for that trick or compromised. Look at Ceau\u0219escu again (or Stalin's/Putin's actions against protesters or the Tienanmen Square massacre, etc.) where there was genuine glee from the unethical leaders to see those opposed to them had made themselves so readily available for identification and destruction. \n\nThe ONLY mass protest that succeeded for Ceau\u0219escu was when things got so bad people couldn't eat. Only that created a nationwide protest with anger sufficient to sway even the military. (also see Arab Spring). The US has about 10-20 years of looting by unethical oligarchs and 2025 Heritage Foundation supporters before we're looking at nationwide famines.\n\nSo whatever you do, once the Trump regime starts, DO NOT PROTEST in the street like this. I know you want to do something, but trump, like Ceau\u0219escu, will use these events to destroy your movement and he's backed by a muskie that has massive amounts of data and tracking ability with starlink. \n\nWhat to do? learn the difference between \"protests of persuasion\" and \"protests of coercion\" Don't go to any \"we're here to peacefully get noticed\" protests of persuasion. Look up how the Selma Voter drive was a method of coercion and winning that lawsuit allowed blacks and supporters to no longer be arrested for loitering when trying to register to vote. It wasn't getting beaten on TV that changed things, it was winning that lawsuit which changed registration rates from close to 0% to close to 100%. \n\nTLDR; Don't do mass peaceful protests of these kinds hoping to convince the corrupt about anything ... run for local boards, offices, and make change happen.",

Trump is outperforming Biden 2020 by a pretty significant Margin in swing states, lets look:\n\nWisconsin:\n\n2020 Biden: 1,631,000 votes\n\n2020 Trump: 1,610,000 votes\n\n2024 Trump: 1,697,000 votes.\n\n2024 Harris: 1,668,000 votes.\n\nMichigan:\n\n2020 Biden: 2,800,000 votes\n\n2020 Trump: 2,649,000 votes\n\n2024: Trump: 2,795,000\n\n2024 Harris: 2,714,000\n\nPennsylvania: \n\n2020 Biden: 3,460,000 votes\n\n2020 Trump: 3,378,000 votes.\n\n2024 Trump: 3,473,000 votes\n\n2024: Harris: 3,339,000 votes\n\nNorth Carolina: \n\n2020 Biden: 2,684,000 votes\n\n2020 Trump: 2,759,000 votes\n\n2024 Trump: 2,876,000 votes\n\n2024 Harris: 2,685,000 votes.\n\nGeorgia: \n\n2020 Biden: 2,474,000 votes\n\n2020 Trump: 2,461,000 votes\n\n2024 Trump: 2,653,000 votes\n\n2024 Harris: 2,539,000 votes.\n\n  \nArizona and Nevada still too early to tell, but as you can see, if Trumps support remained completely stagnate from 2020, Harris would've carried 3/7 swing states with a shot to flip Pennsylvania too. Moreover, if she had maintained Bidens vote count in swing states she would've lost most states even harder with the exception of maybe flipping Michigan and Pennsylvania being closer than it was. These appear to be the only states with a genuine argument for apathy/protest votes.\n\nThe turn out is NOT lower where it actually matters. The news articles that said swing states had record turn out were genuinely correct, you were just wrong for thinking it was democrats and not republicans. Almost all the popular vote bleeding comes from solid blue states deciding not to vote and it would not have changed the outcome of this election if they did show up to vote. Can we retire this cope now?",

We run around trying to keep it fair and keep people happy, and Elon just cuts those departments from his budget and laughs since it saves him money and headaches.  Trump will take off his guardrails and Musk will show the world just how bad it can get.  I say we let them see it.",
         ">  I\u2019m seeing so many comments where people are saying that Harris didn\u2019t really have a platform, which isn\u2019t really true. I also see a lot of comments that are just claiming that her platform was just \u201cwhite men bad\u201d, \u201corange man bad\u201d, etc. which are just straw men arguments. \n\nIt's not just an American problem. It's happening in Canada too. The sitting Liberal government is getting trounced in the polls with an election next year, and when anyone talks about them it's always the same thing \"They've been in power for 10 years and have done nothing\".\n\nApparently nothing = nationwide $10/day daycare, legalizing cannabis, several new social safety net programs, a world class response to covid19, a national dentalcare program, a carbon tax, the start of a national pharmacare program. And those are just the highlights. They've been one of the most effective governments in Canadian history. But all you hear is \"They've done nothing, Trudeau sucks, woke nonsense party\".\n\nMeanwhile our current Conservative leader is a libertarian clown whose entire campaign is based on slogans that fit on a sticker. \"Axe the Tax\", \"Spike the Hike\", \"Take back Canada\", \"Bring it home\", \"Freedom, not fear\". He spends most of his time in the media just ridiculing Liberals, and attacking the media, copying the Trump playbook. And he's currently way ahead in the polls. It's a sad joke.",
         "I'm seeing a ton of very suspicious low karma/long time inactive accounts blaming the DNC and lack of a primary, and that Harris was forced on voters who have stayed at home because they are angry at the Democratic party.

         "Nobody will use them because history has shown that people shy away from social media platforms with excessive moderation.\n\nIt's why X is still one of the biggest social media platforms out there despite everyone claiming they would leave when Elon cut back on the moderation, while the places that sprung up to try to fill the market opening for a heavily-moderated Twitter clone (including those pushed by equally wealthy billionaires such as Threads) have failed to gather much of a userbase.",

         "We had a similar issue in my area during the UK elections, multiple parties banging on about how bad it is in Palestine.\n\nNo offense but I want political parties to focus on the fucking shit show in *my* country first before we start criticising political leaders about wars they literally cannot control and are on **the other side of the planet**. I feel bad for the people of Palestine but I also feel bad for the people of North Korea, the Uighur Muslims in China, the non-Hindus in India, and the women in Iran, but right now I care more about the fact that both the economy and our social services are both fucked at the same time and would like British leaders to prioritise the really pressing issues in Britain first. Foreign issues that are not affecting the day to day lives of the majority of the country should not be a focal point on your political pick.",

         "The majority of people who oppose the genocide in Palestine still voted for Harris, because they knew that Trump would be even worse. \n\nThe idea that the few who didn't decided the result of the election is patently ridiculous. That's a vanishingly small minority, and blaming them for Trump's victory only serves to mask the actual failings of the democratic party. \n\nIf all the democrats learn from this election is \"people opposed to genocide cost us this damn election!\" then congratulations, you're setting the party up for more failure in 2028, 2032, etc.",
         "The insanely fucked up part of all this, is they did Palestine ***no*** favors. They were upset about the situation there, which I understand, I think most people in the democratic party *are in that same boat*. But by not voting, they have signed their death warrant. \n\nPalestine is about to become scorched earth and ash. \n\nGood job. \n\nKamala/Biden may not have been on the right side of history on this subject, but with Kamala in office, we could have at least had a platform to stand on to continue to try and make change. Now we have nothing.",

         "Yes, they have. People have forgotten everything about the years 2016-2020 and for some reason have this false version of history where Trump was the best president ever and the economy was booming and the pandemic didn't happen at all and Biden didn't beat Trump but also no one tried to overthrow the election.",

But people who can't afford the basics or an occasional luxury (and calling McDonald's a luxury is a stretch that makes this point more significant) don't really give a damn about the stock market.\n\nEveryday people need to see goods be affordable. That means prices need to come down, or *their* wages need to go up. Not the national average wage, but their personal wages. And they need to go up enough to offset higher prices so they actually can feel the additional spending power they have.\n\nThat said, there's a definite double standard where Republicans always seem to get credit for a good economy, and Democrats always seem to get the blame for a bad economy, and it never seems to work in reverse, and that's also a problem. On the other hand, while I think blame is often stated and apportioned unfairly, in the voting booth, it's pretty even - if the economy is bad, the party in power, notably the party with the presidency, is usually punished for it.

This makes it harder on all of us for obvious reasons. \n\nAnd no, Biden does not set the price of burgers. That is not the point. The point is your misplaced faith in crumbling imaginary money games.

This will resonate with people but the democrats are afraid to lose corporate backers. Bernie sanders was the closet we\u2019ve had to hitting this message and Obama did well with it too.

         "I'm sorry, but it's really the stupid vs the more stupid argument.\n\nYes, groceries are more expensive. Why is that? People say inflation, but it's not \"classical\" inflation that caused it - although we all experienced it as inflation.\n\nOPEC and its allies like Russia started in 2021 to restrict extractions, although world economy was firing up again after the first Covid winter, artificially increasing global oil prices by between 5 to 10 percent per month, with the highes level in June 2022 (more than double from April 2021). Gas prices rose in the same manner reaching three times the price in August 2022, compared to April 2021. What happens when global energy prices rise? Anything gets more expensive, since anything has partially energy cost. The reality is, that these price hikes had been deliberate by OPEC+ and it's allies. Something, that Biden and also not Trump could've stopped.\n\nBut what did Biden do? The Inflaction Reduction Act increased Gas and Oil production and it worked - the only problem was, that domestic fossile corporations weren't able to increase their production as needed in that short amount of time because of worker shortage due to the pandemic. Still, the US recoverd far faster than any other nation on the globe.\n\nSo the reality is, people do not understand inflation in general and how the price hike happened - and that nothing could've done about it in April 2021, because the new administration just started it's work back then and legislation takes time.\n\nThe real kicker is, that Biden and his admin understood the economy, the causes and acted accordingly where they could get bipartisan support. What Biden wasn't able to do, because Republicans blocked it, is to raise the minimum wage to alleviate the pain on all americans. So he increased that of federal workers and contractors of federal projects, and is still fighting the legal battle in court - with the Supreme Court probably opining that Biden can't do that per executive order.\n\nBut yes: The next years will be rough. If you think a partial energy price hike that gave as like 9% \"inflation\" in 2022, 20% tariffs of all imported goods will result in a price hike of the century. Pair that with Musks idiotic idea to cut federal budget by 2 trillion (which is then just gone from the economy, resulting in fewer federal contracts and paid federal workers, resulting in less buying power, generating more joblessness and whatnot. It's going to be insanely shitty for lower and middle income people - but hey, since they in majority did not go voting or voted Trump, it's what they want i guess?",
         "It\u2019s because we don\u2019t want to face the actual reasons for inflation and are keen to blame it on monetary policy pushed by \u201cglobal elites\u201d. It\u2019s climate change doing most of the damage, and protectionist policy doing the rest. \n\n\u201cOn shoring is inherently inflationary, just like off shoring is deflationary\u201d\n\nAmericans asked for Inflation.",

         "I don\u2019t think that would work the way you want. Right wing populism is much more of an American instinct than left wing, and always has been. Left wing populism is, at a minimum, instantly viewed with skepticism by most people as something communistic and foreign. Practically speaking, a left wing populism wouldn\u2019t work in our system.\n\nLet\u2019s say AOC runs for president in 2028. Let\u2019s also understand that about $14 billion dollars was \u201cdonated\u201d and spent for the 2024 election across the board. (https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2024-us-election-pac-spending-donations-fec/). The billionaires and millionaires are not going to fund a left wing populist because they, like right wing rich people, like their money and like their power, one of the big reasons Bernie didn\u2019t get the nomination. This is why \u201ccorporate Democrats\u201d dominate. Politics in our system requires dump trucks of money, and that money will never go to the far left. AOC or whoever would never get off the ground because she couldn\u2019t match funding from Trump, Musk, Mellon, Uhlein, etc. in raising enough money to stay relevant. Yes, this is perverse, but that\u2019s the system we have and there isn\u2019t a way around it.\n\nAnd that issue of funding is before any issue of message. And that, too, would not really hit with most people. The average general election voter makes a choice based on their perception of the economy, while not understanding economics. Voters can hold diametrically opposed views, like wanting lower prices, while also wanting tariffs and protectionism and immigration restrictions. Left wing populism would have to overcome both the instinctual fear of anything left wing\u2014 while also overcoming the nonsensical positions of the right\u2014 that usually require more government spending, regulation and size. I don\u2019t see that happening.",

         "These people are going to eat each other again just like last time.\u00a0\n\nPurity test will be administered and anyone found lacking will get thrown to the wolves.\u00a0\n\nIt is funny to watch them already flipping out and starting the circular firing squad.\u00a0\n\nThere is only one alpha in the pack and they all think that is them.\u00a0",
         "I guess that\u2019s the silver lining behind this cloud. Trump surrounds himself with incompetent people that couldn\u2019t run a Taco Bell. They\u2019ll get jobs in his administration and won\u2019t be able to execute on his agenda.",
         "Fuck the Telegraph. \n\nThey worked real hard to push anti-Biden and anti-Harris content throughout the election cycle. The op-eds they published, in particular, were batshit insane.",

         "Of course they are going to fuck up and destroy everything.  That\u2019s the plan. \n\nThe big strategic play here is:\n\nStep 1 - Trump & Co absolutely wreck the federal government, the economy, and the social fabric of the USA.  \n\nStep 2 - The obscenely wealthy sweep in and buy up all the valuable pieces at fire sale prices.  \n\nStem 3 - In a few years the USA will be an impoverished, corrupt oligarchy like Russia.\n\nThe Republican Party has been re-tooled to do this work. Trump is a tool.  Vance is a tool.  They are all tools.",
         "Members of Donald Trump\u2019s team started turning on each other at the election victory party and became embroiled in x-rated arguments, it can be revealed.\n\nOne of Mr Trump\u2019s campaign managers reportedly told a senior adviser he was going to \u201cf---ing destroy\u201d him at a victory party on Tuesday night.\n\nChris LaCivita repeatedly swore at Corey Lewandowki following a damaging leak to the media about him apparently profiting from the campaign, according to Politico.\n\nWhen Mr Lewandowski approached Mr LaCivita on Tuesday night, extending a hand and offering his congratulations, he is said to have responded: \u201cF--- you, f--- you and f--- you.\u201d\n\nMr LaCivita continued: \u201cYou have f-----d with the wrong person. I\u2019m going to f---ing destroy you.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Beast recently reported that Mr LaCivita had made $22 million off the Trump campaign over the course of two years \u2013 prompting a furious response from the president-elect.\n\nMr LaCivita is said to have produced bank statements and Federal Election Commission (FEC) when confronted by Mr Trump to disprove this. Campaign officials blame Mr Lewandowski for the briefing.\n\n**Read more from The Telegraph:** [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/07/donald-trump-kamala-harris-us-election-live-updates/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2024/11/07/donald-trump-kamala-harris-us-election-live-updates/)",
         "yes, that's how Trump runs things. he pits everyone against each other so he can stay in power. fortunately, this limits the amount of damage he can do.",
         "Isn't that a good sign?\n\nMaybe he won't accomplish much of Project 2025 after all. If Republicans are so prone to infighting now.",
         "The one silver lining and ray of hope that I cling to in this  nightmare is that Trump is basically going to surrond himself with power hungry and greedy assholes who lack any experience in what they are doing and will likely be stepping over each other to curry Trump's favor.\n\nOn top of which, getting rid of experienced government employees, some of whom worked in their jobs for years, if not decades, will create a vacuum that will be filled by poorly trained replacements who's only qualifications are blind loyalty to Trump.\n\nMy point is, all this will bog down the government and hopefully slow things down enough to where Republicans get little done despite controlling the government and buy time for the midterms to arrive and the Democrats to reclaim at least one of the chambers of Congress \n\nWhich I feel is possible.    Trump and his group of idiots are going to screw things up badly and they don't have the Democrats to blame this time.\n\nSure, the MAGA faithful will blindly support Trump and blame everyone else, but others outside that cult can see who caused the damage.\n\nAll the Democrats need to do is prepare a slate of candidates to take back both chambers and Ruthlessly pound the Trump Administration and Republicans for their mistakes.   Don't let up, blitz them in the news and ads.    Make sure they can't spin this around.",
         "Honestly the thing I was most excited about to vote for Kamala was the end of this reign of chaos. Every day is a headline with Trump. I can\u2019t handle it for 4 more years.",

         "The one constant from Trump is that he's a really shitty boss and doesn't know how to be a leader so his underlings are constantly fighting over who can kiss his ass the hardest. The next administration is gonna be a snake pit.",

         "Once RFK jr isn\u2019t of good use, he\u2019ll be fired in 15 minutes. It\u2019s one of the only entertaining things about a Trump administration is seeing Trump ass kissers angry and surprised by that.",

         "It always depends how long Musk and RFK and the likes are useful for DonOld Trump. They were so far, but will they be in January?",
         "And now, Idiocracy has a mandate in America",
         "This is the most shocking part of all of this really, that the people seeking to hand unchecked power to Trump think... they'll be safe from that? \n\nHis supporters have always been his biggest victims, from the voters who died in their thousands from covid because he told them to, to the numerous lawyers, cronies and enablers who have had their lives and careers shattered by association with him. All the way up to his *vice president who he literally tried to have killed by a mob*.\n\nIf God forbid, Trump does in fact succeed in becoming the arbitrary dictator he clearly wants to be, aside from a few Dems like Pelosi and Schiff who Trump fixates on, who is going to inevitably end up the prime gulag targets? Obviously the very people in his inner circle who put him there, as soon as they anger or disappoint him in any way. Which they will, because there's nothing Trump seems to enjoy more than turning on former allies. \n\nThey might gain some lower raxes, and the freedom to do some more crimes without the attention of the DOJ for a while, but is that really worth being at the mercy of the whim of a man like Trump?",

We shouldn't be surprised. But don't think for a second that we'll avoid the tsunami of evil that's coming our way. It might look different than what we imagine now, but it's still coming",
         "The shitshow begins. Again.",
         "I think that's the one thing that gives me comfort. Prior to the Trump era, Republicans (for the most part) actually wanted to govern. They actually had policies. \n\nNow? Their policy is \"No government!\" And they don't know how to actually govern. We saw this in 2017 - 2022, we'll see this now. These people who want to dismantle the government don't know how it works.",

         "Here\u2019s why I\u2019m not worried: Republicans hate everything, including each other. You have Joe Rogan fans in the same tent as pro-life evangelicals. The Republican consensus is gonna fall apart on the first hurdle. They\u2019ve been the house majority for like two years and done fuck all. Trump burned GOP senators for making an immigration bill! They can\u2019t  govern, and you have to be able to govern if you want to do things, even bad things",
         "I think RFK will be one of the first ones to go. Every Republican in government gets money from big pharma. There\u2019s zero chance they would be ok with him \u201cdoing whatever he wants\u201d with the FDA.",

         "It will be more competitive sycophantry right out of the gate.",
         "I think Trump won\u2019t finish this term.  He served his purpose his ego and declining facilities will only be a hindrance to Musk, Theil And the other billionaires hoping to become American oligarchs.  the architects of project 2025 can execute their plans with Vance just as easily and arguably more controllably.  He might have a medical issue or they will stop covering for him and just article 25 him.  That will probably be worse for America but it\u2019s what I think will happen.",

Being that Trump is Scar, I am particularly excited about the end of this story in which all his cronies eat him alive. The only downside, they destroy so much before they get to the eating him part \ud83d\ude14.",
         "They keep blaming Joe Biden for the loss. I think the biggest issue was that the Democrats put their support behind Kamala Harris and didn\u2019t realize the nation wasn\u2019t ready to accept a female president. Even my SIL came over the other day and saw Kamala on the tv and starting going on about how obnoxious it is she talks with her hands\u2026? Idk either\u2026 my point is men and women both view women in a bad light no matter their accomplishments",
         "The values at play in Trumpism lend itself to this kind of thing. If people admire Trump and try to be like him, this is the inevitable result. \n\nI'm glad the GOP has both houses of Congress. It will be hard to blame the Democrats when they fail to deliver.",

If history has shown us anything, it\u2019s that we need to stay vigilant about our health system.\n\nDoes anyone remember the chaos of the early days of the pandemic? It\u2019s impossible to forget the lives lost \u2013 lives that didn\u2019t have to be. There was a severe mishandling of resources, communication, and basic safety protocols that led to unnecessary deaths and trauma for so many families, including my own. Those in power knew what was coming but were more concerned about appearances than actually saving lives. Did the majority of voters have a memory lapse or did it not impact them? \n\nNow, as we enter a new phase of administration, it\u2019s critical that we don\u2019t forget those lessons. If the past has taught us anything, it\u2019s that we have to be proactive. We have to advocate for ourselves and each other, demand better healthcare, push for real policies, and make sure our voices are heard. So many of us lost friends, family members, coworkers\u2014these weren\u2019t just numbers on a screen; they were people with names and stories.\n\nSo, here\u2019s my call to action for all of us: Get your healthcare in order. Get involved, make your concerns known, and don\u2019t let history repeat itself. Don\u2019t sit back and wait. We owe it to ourselves, our families, and the memory of those we lost to make sure our healthcare system doesn\u2019t fall back into a place where lives are seen as expendable.",

         "Jesus, Americans really are idiots.  \n\nThe entire industrialized west is going through a right wing surge, driven by anger over decades of neoliberal economics which have routed the working classes.  But instead of being angry over lost wages, voters have easily been swayed by racist and religious rhetoric, blaming immigrants and gay people for people's woes. The German people were quite easily convinced to blame Jews for the pain the Great Depression and the Treaty of Versailles caused. \n\nHad the parties of working classes (Democrats, Labour, etc.) actually looked after their constituents instead of capitulating to the rich 40 years ago, the rage which racists and Christians so effectively exploited would have been muted.\n\nCanada is only a couple of years behind the US.  Multiple European countries are seeing the growth of hard right parties, driven by rhetoric about minorities and immigrants.\n\nAny society based in capitalism will eventually fail like this.  Capitalism -> late stage capitalism -> fascism.  Once capitalism has taken everything from everyone, they get mad and they start to vote for things like unions.  Billionaires don't want that, so they have to get people to vote against their economic interests.  But how?\n\nReligion and racism.  And those things are in such plentiful supply globally that fascism will always win.  Every time the working class tries to improve it's situation, we'll be met with this.\n\nLook at the Great Depression and WWII.  It only took capital 30 years to undo the New Deal.  \n\nLet's say there's 50 years of violence in front of us.  And after 40 million people die, there's another post WWII period of relative peace and prosperity.  In 20-30 years, capitalism will destroy it and return to the robber baron era again and we'll go through this again.  It's unstoppable.\n\nAs long as we live under an economic system like this, we will know no peace.\n\nAs long as we allow adults to believe in magic sky daddy, capitalists will have an army ready to murder on their behalf.  \n\nObviously, those last two points are never going to change.  I don't have kids, so when I'm dead, my suffering ends.  For those of you who have children, their suffering has just begun.",

Here is one recent example:   \n\nhttps://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/03/trump-haitian-migrants-deport-00182328\n\n> Former President Donald Trump is promising to remove Temporary Protected Status and deport the Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio \u2014 an escalation in rhetoric against a community his campaign has targeted with misinformation for weeks.\n> \n> \u201cAbsolutely I\u2019d revoke it and I\u2019d bring them back to their country,\u201d Trump told NewsNation.\n> \n> The GOP presidential nominee\u2019s onslaught against the migrants in Springfield has been at the forefront of his campaign in recent weeks, including his now-infamous line in the debate against Vice President Kamala Harris where he accused the migrants of eating their neighbor\u2019s pets \u2014 a baseless claim that nonetheless sparked bomb threats targeting Springfield schools. Trump\u2019s running mate, Ohio Republican Sen. JD Vance, had reposted the claims on social media leading up to the debate.\n> \n> In his interview with NewsNation, Trump said the influx of migrants in the community \u201cjust doesn\u2019t work\u201d and \u201cyou have to remove the people; we cannot destroy our country.\u201d Roughly 15,000 Haitian migrants have relocated to Springfield in recent years, according to the Associated Press.\n> \n> Temporary Protected Status allows migrants to stay in the U.S. when their countries are unsafe to return to. In many cases, the countries are undergoing armed conflict, but environmental disasters and other conditions can also lead to TPS being granted. There are currently 16 countries whose citizens have TPS in the U.S. As of March 31, there were over 860,000 people in the U.S. with the temporary status, according to the American Immigration Council.\n> \n> Despite ongoing criticism for their rhetoric around the migrants in Springfield, Vance and Trump have continued to double down. \u201cI\u2019m still going to keep on talking about what the migrants have done to Springfield, Ohio, and what Kamala Harris\u2019 open border has done to Springfield, Ohio,\u201d Vance said in mid-September on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d\n> \n> Some of Trump\u2019s allies believe his continued focus on Springfield has caused his campaign to lose some focus. And Harris has said Trump\u2019s rhetoric against the migrants \u201chas to stop.\u201d\n> \n> \u201cRegardless of someone\u2019s background, their race, their gender, their geographic location, I know that people are deeply troubled by what is happening to that community in Springfield, Ohio, and it\u2019s got to stop,\u201d Harris said in an interview with the National Association of Black Journalists in September.  \n\nBefore you claim they aren't legal immigrants:  \n\nhttps://springfieldohio.gov/immigration-faqs/  \n\n> Q: Are the immigrants here legally and how did they qualify?\n> A: YES, Haitian immigrants are here legally, under the Immigration Parole Program. Once here, immigrants are then eligible to apply for Temporary Protected Status (TPS). Haiti is designated by the Secretary of Homeland Security for TPS. Current TPS is granted through February 3, 2026.",
         "And yet how much did they find at the mouth for people coming here through the asylum process, which is also a legal avenue for entry into the country.\n\nAlso consider how exactly they're going to identify supposed \"illegal\" immigrants living in the US. Do you think they're going to have measured response where they wait until they have evidence of specific instances and then act, or are they going to just blast through minority communities and treat non-whites as illegal as illegal until proven otherwise?\n\nSeparately, let's not fool ourselves that this fuck or his supporters actually \"want\" immigrants to come to the US. Some might accept it, but I doubt many of them want any minorities immigration into their communities. Look at the broad brush with which Trump tried to keep out Muslims during the last term. It's not that hard to see him say something like \"too many of these people coming in from Mexico are illegal, so we have to prevent them coming in entirely.\" If you don't think he's very capable of doing that, you're kidding yourself.",

So what is his plan for alleviating the influx of asylum seekers and moving them through the process quickly to be \u201clegal\u201d? Cause right now the process is backed-up heavily, and we do have a lot of people here that are not technically legal, but they\u2019re not illegal because they are going through that asylum process. How is he going to help them go through the process quicker so they are not in that limbo of quasi legal/illegal? Because my understanding is he wants to deport millions of \u201cillegals\u201d but he is grouping people that are going through the asylum process as illegal.",
         "Have you looked into what goes into \"legally\" moving here? It takes YEARS and even then probably not. When they say \"come here legally\" it amounts to a shadow ban on all immigration. They have no clue and if the shoe were on the other foot, they'd be hollering about having to wait an hour for lunch.",

They want one with more provincial control that is cross transferrable with CPP called APP.\n\nWhich btw is exactly what Quebec has with their QPP.\n\nI've noticed a lot of dishonest conversations on Reddit here regarding this and I'm fairly confident this is why PP is gonna win. The liberal party rather then focus on improving stuff rather focus on mis-leading to win.\n\nThe liberal party twice promised to regulate the election to be fairer representation but then failed to do so TWICE.

         "I think the bottom line is that it is just very easy to convince average voters that Republicans are better for them. \n\nLet's try a few: \"A developer is going to come in here and put in low income housing. This is going to increase your taxes because those kids are going to go into the schools. A lot of those kids won't be from this area, a lot of them will be immigrants, and they will cause problems for other kids. What do you think?\"\n\nHow about: \"There's a proposal to allow more immigrants into our community. They're going to be competing with you for your job. Their kids are going to crowd the schools, and will take up more of the teacher's time which she won't be able to give to your kids. What do you think about that?\"\n\nHow about this: \"I hear that there are some boys on the other schools team who claimed that they were girls so that they could play sports. They're dominating our kids. They also go into the girls bathroom just to watch the girls change. What do you think about that?\"\n\nHow about this one: \"People want to raise the minimum wage. That just means that your food is going to go up in price. Why don't those people just work harder, get out of those minimum wage jobs. That's how they should be able to make more money, not by us giving our hard-earned money to them.\"\n\nHere's another one. \"I heard that the hiring director is looking at the resumes, and isn't interested on hiring any white men. He looked at our department, and realized we were all white men, so he's going to ignore the best candidates out there, and hire somebody unqualified. What do you think about that?\"\n\nHow about this one: \"they're talking about shutting down the power plant, and replacing it with solar and wind. Everyone knows that solar and wind are more expensive. Why should we pay more for our electricity? It's not fair that we will have to spend our money on this.\"\n\nThis is really easy to do when voters are not told the entire picture, and when they are not intellectually curious enough to explore all sides of the issue. I guess you can argue that they are voting their immediate interests, and if that is the case, then we should probably bring back things like racial discrimination, no fault divorce, coal power plants, and the like. Those things are all better in The short term for more of the people in this country.\n\nI do think that part of the problem is that when people are in a less comfortable position than they are used to, they bunker down and vote their own immediate interests more. If you're worried that you're going to lose your job and not find another, then of course you are going to oppose any policy that's going to make you finding a job harder.\n\nYes, Democrats have focused more on long-term things versus short-term things. This may be why they have really flipped their constituency, there are more moderately wealthy people supporting Democrats these days - people who have done well, and are able to think about the future instead of the immediate present. In order to change that, Democrats are going to have to do what they did up until the 1970s - ignore things like civil rights, racism, homophobia, the climate, and push things that the majority of people want *right now*. \n\nThat will **not** include universal healthcare, by the way, because most people already have health insurance. That will not include things like solar, green energy, because those things are more expensive. That will not include even talking about any racial disparities, because the majority of voters don't care about that. It will likely include cutting social programs, so that taxes can be lowered - because Republicans are right in that there aren't enough \"rich people\" to tax to fund things.\n\nSo at that point, aren't Democrats just Reagan Republicans?",

Until we know more detailed demographics we can't obviously know whether or not the 100k or so voters flipped to Trump or simply stayed home, but either way, the fact under this premise is even if everyone who voted for Biden voted for her this election, she still needed a relatively small number of new voters to actually win.\n\nFrom this perspective, we can rationally see that this election was a lot closer than it actually seemed from a purely electoral vote based perspective. PA basically came down to a want of about 127k or so votes, and more than probably a lot of those were ones that stayed home, either over her policy or apathy; and ones that switched to Trump in demographics Trump has grown in since four years ago (all of them).\n\nThis is the story for basically every swing state; Harris really only lost this election by something closer to less than million and half voters in seven states. She likely wouldn't have gotten the popular vote but the swing states were extremely competitive compared to the rest of the country,  if just a few more people came out to support her in those states, she would have won just by electoral count.\n\nMichigan, Wisconsin and Nevada were relatively close (under 100k votes needed to flip to blue for each), and then she just would have had to flip any of the remaining swing states with 13+ electoral votes, with the closest being Georgia (120k) and Pennsylvania being the next closest at (127k).\n\nThis nation's destiny was basically altered by a difference of choices for about 500,000 people in specific states. That's how actually close this race was... we needed literally, less than half a million more votes honestly, in four states if you really break it down into just wanting an electoral victory.",

They can only build so many camps for all of these people they need to store, so what's the logical conclusion for somebody who doesn't give a fuck about the lives of these people?

Again, this is global. Wages thus have a harder time catching up with inflation. Exporters are hurt, especially smaller ones that are more susceptible to tariffs. Entrepreneurship and innovation collapses due to a lack of feasibility. Productivity remains stagnant. This all further fuels the political changes as in (1).\n\n3. A collapse in asset prices, due to the above. This is the read why the global ultra-wealthy are so attached to far-Right parties. Because they want to buy up assets on the cheap. \n\nYou can get away with all of this by ensuring two things. A. Removing democratic structures, and therefore accountability; and B.

Ones that are connected to a certain class of people that are *extraordinarily wealthy*. These aren\u2019t just your usual rich people.

So they hosted monthly meetings for \"Women in Technology\" and \"Girl Coders\", two local groups.  Then they hosted all kinds of \"women in tech\" events, with speakers on tech, on women leadership in tech, on how to negotiate as a woman in tech.  We'd get emails about the events, or lunch speakers for women, all kinds of things going on.\n\nI do remember on day though.  Lots of food being set up near me, and I was wondering if I might get a bit of it.  It was another event, this time for college women, helping them start their careers in tech.  I don't know why that one got me, but I had this feeling of \"wait... do they NOT want me here?\"\n\nI know that wasn't the message.  I know women are underrepresented in tech, and even discriminated against.  It's just that after being told 1000 times that \"we need women, women are great, women are special, let's help women\" i had a moment of thinking \"are they trying to get rid of the guys?\"\n\nThere needs to be some messaging directed towards men other than \"you already have enough, so please just stay quiet while we help everyone else.

It started during the 2016 election and I can tell you it was because I wanted to be anti-system/counter culture whatever. It started with a youtube account called Rekt feminist videos or something, then Paul Joseph Watson and Andy Warski, Ben Shapiro, Jordan Peterson kinda, and thankfully I got partially disaffected when watching a Steven Crowder video where he was insulting the Muslim Prophet Muhammed and after reading a lot of hateful and bile comments about muslims. I remember thinking to myself that \u201cwow these people hate me.\u201d Around that same time the muslim ban happened and that\u2019s when I no longer supported the right/republicans. Total situation where I didn\u2019t care about how Trumps presidency affected people because at that time I thought I was fine and of course \u201cone of the good ones.\u201d If I were white I do not know if I would have ever escaped from the pipeline and I know that I\u2019m not alone in my experience. I cringe looking back and thinking about who I was and what I supported, it makes me feel sick. I\u2019m so glad I got out but there are people just like me who haven\u2019t gotten a wakeup call.

Female only.\n\n\nThen, if they manage to be the majority to make it to university, they see scholarships that are for every race and females, and some they do apply for have that last section of the form asking what \"boxes\" they can check.\n\n\nThen, if they manage to graduate, they face a job market with that final line that says \"Preferred candidates from the following groups: Female, person of colour, indigenous, disabled...\" - basically without writing it \"we don't want a white male\".\n\n\nAfter someone has faced this for years and years, why would you be surprised that they gravitate towards someone (Rogan, Tate, Musk, Trump) selling them bullshit, but at least giving an outlet for their frustration.\n\n\nGen Z males are less educated, earn less money, have lower rates of home ownership, and have higher rates of suicide, than females.\n\n\nWe just need someone to address this, and do what has been done for females, but now do it for males, especially, to push and give help to push into female dominated professions.\n\n\nWhen all of the above is raised, a common response from the very \"progressive\" left is either:\n\n\n1. \"Oh, too bad, men are now facing trouble\".

Literally every critique contradicts itself, the strategy and messaging is not why she lost. Most of the people voting could barely tell you what policy proposals either side has. Most of the people who voted for Trump probably never even listened to a campaign speech...it's literally just the economic conditions. The cost of living is up NOW and the reasons behind it do not matter. We've seen it happen all over the world with post covid inflation, the incumbent takes all of the blame and is most likely to lose. Biden got inflation under control...but wages lag. It's not a problem that can be fixed in a couple years. \n\nThe simple fact is that every demographic has felt the effects of the economy. I believe their anger is misplaced because the damage Trump caused from mishandling the pandemic, colluding with foreign powers, big oil, and a do nothing republican congress is undeniable. Trump's plans will make things worse with tariffs and mass deportation if/when it happens...It doesn't matter though. Housing prices are up, grocery bills are higher, energy bills are higher.

My brain is the most valuable part of me.  Humanity has spent millenia squandering our collective potential by forcing talented women into domestic servitude and broodmare duties.  We will be better off by every possible metric if we continue to allow women to choose their own path. As a scientist, I am eternally grateful to the women who fought so hard for me to have a chance to earn a place in that world.  I didn't get there because of diversity quotas, I got there because of the qualifications on my CV.  And I love it.  It is so fulfilling.  My life would be so joyless and empty if I was forced into motherhood and domestic drudgery instead of using my energy and talents to do science.\n\nExcluding women has been an incalculable tragedy for our species. How many Marie Curies have died in childbirth over the years?  How many Rosalind Franklins withered away changing diapers instead of discovering things in a laboratory?

Some women are raised in culturally and religiously conservative environments where they are taught to accept a position of inferiority.  Some women simply aren't given a choice.  Some women enjoy unequal power dynamics.  I can't say I empathize or understand how that could be appealing, but humans are diverse and have variable desires.  Some women just have low self esteem and think they can't do any better.\n\nI can say that a significant plurality of women do not like being characterized as inferior, being treated as commodities to be obtained, and being pigeonholed into specific roles they do not want or enjoy simply because they are a certain gender.  And those women find such rhetoric to be deeply unappealing and will avoid romantic partners who espouse such views.",

Republicans in general have had plenty of chances to show they support women and that they don\u2019t support rape and rapists and they constantly only get rid of rapists from their party when the public outrage becomes too intense and the person is no longer electable. Trump doesn\u2019t have that problem, he can be found liable for raping a woman in a court of law and then be elected president, so the republicans and their supporters see no reason to get rid of him\u2026 the conclusion we can draw from this is that rape is not a reason to be ousted in and of itself for Republicans. This is a despicable message, but one that millions of Americans voted for.\n\nDoes it make them rapists? Nope\u2026\nDoes it mean they don\u2019t really care about rape or rapists holding power? Yup\n\nIt\u2019s unfair to call someone a supporter or rape or SA based on their political beliefs or the party they support unless the party they support literally is being led by a rapist and they directly voted for the rapist to be president of the country they live in, then it\u2019s fair game to call them a supporter of rape I think, if we can\u2019t judge people\u2019s character based on their beliefs and actions then we would be completely unable to sort out right from wrong even where it is crystal clear.",

He said anything, went anywhere.\n\nDemocrats are not acknowledging that the system is broken, and people don't care about shit like 'the rule of law' and 'the constitution' when they are stuck working at the local gas station. They feel that things suck.  Trump told them there was someone to blame for their problems.\n\nDems didn't acknowledge the problem. They touted 'economists' who kept saying 'actually it's really good'.  It doesn't feel that way to many people. Dems lost this. They said nothing. Took no stances on most things. Sided with republicans on the border, sided with republicans on Israel, dropped medicare, etc. \n\nEven Hillary had medicare in her campaign. Bill did in 94.\n\nBut the very most of all, democrats come across as elitist and out of touch. And they came across that way because they ARE elitist and out of touch. Much like this sub in many ways. I suspect democrat staffers spend way too much time listening to echo chambers like this. Neoliberalism killed the Republican party in 2012. It's killed the democratic party in 2024.",

         "When the Democrats went with \"you think you know what you want, but you don't\" in response to 75% of voters saying economic hardship was their top concern and then went hard on reproductive and LGBTQ+ rights, they lost. Now, they can't protect the civil rights of anyone. They failed everyone. Biden touted the strong economy and said inflation was stopped faster here than in the UK, and it came off very cavalier. When Harris said she didn't disagree with anything Biden did, she became Hubert Humphrey saying we're winning in Vietnam.\n\nPeople will try to blame the loss on bigotry or Gaza or media brainwashing, but the Democrats were cavalier about economic issues as the incumbent when the majority of voters had it as their #1 issue. Just another episode of the Democrats 'when keeping it real goes wrong.'",

California, for example, is barely halfway done with their totals.\n\nSo when we eventually see Harris make up 6-9 million more votes when it's all said and done, it's not some conspiracy.  Trump is going to win the popular vote, but it's not going to be at the current margin.",
         "This will get lost in the shuffle but:\n1. The Democratic Party has ran on protecting democracy from Trump for 3 presidential cycles and every off-year cycle in between. However, there has not been concrete communication of what pro-democracy measures the party actually supports outside of stopping Trump. Examples of real policies might be real articulated policies of campaign finance reform, ranked choice voting, changes to gerrymandering, registration changes, etc.\n\n1a. The last three presidential primaries for the democrats have been questionable at best. The part banned together to elect Hillary, Biden, and then didn\u2019t run a primary for Harris. Whether real or perceived Bernie Sanders is seen as being undermined by party elites. Biden ran a primary largely unopposed despite people screaming that he was too old for 2 years. These are all seen/can be characterized as anti democratic. Also when questioned the party infrasture told everyone fall in line or let the fascists win (which may be true but can also come through as a hollow threat till people feel the consequences and it\u2019s too late)\n\n2. The democrats have been saying they are anti corruption but did not denounce billionaire influence in elections (because they benefit too) and have not come out against congressional stock trades (because they benefit too). This allows them to cast as corrupt as republicans or unserious about stopping corruption.\n\n3. The Democratic Party continues to seek out the support of conservatives and corporate interests at the detriment of populist policies. Public health care was abandoned. Workers rights support seems fickle to industry and need (trains v. Teachers v. Automotive, etc.)\n\n4. Not everyone who voted for Trump is a racist. Some are. And there is a belief that one Nazi at a dinner party makes it a Nazi party. But most people are not terminally online, are not up to date on the constant news cycle, and decide who they are going to vote on undetermined reasons at best. Leopards may eat their faces but they will not see a causal chain between that nor be knowledgeable about the events or policies that led there.\n\n5. The powers in charge already seem to have not learned a lesson and are cannibalistic. The narrative is already that progressives, gen z, etc. did not turn out so fuck em. Let them suffer. This is not a unifying message.\n\n6. Generations of people are complaining about not being able to afford housing, food, have job security, access to health care. There are lots of reasons that has not been addressed but cozying up to conservatives, corporations, and blaming younger generations for not falling in line to vote for lack luster policy suggestions is a hard sell.\n\n7. People have watched forever wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. The wars in Ukraine and Israel may be hard sells as they do not have clear end goals or points where the US stops being involved. These conflicts are very different but there is a general sentiment that life is hard here, why do we always have money for bombs over there.\n\n8. Anger is intoxicating and a powerful emotion. Trump encourages anger, gives into base desires to hurt/defame/blame others. I am not saying this is right (it isn\u2019t), but if you\u2019re poor and suffering someone telling you to be pissed off is probably a pretty good feeling.\n\n9. The media can sell stories about anger easier than nuanced policy. The media is owned by billionaires and corporate interests. Even if all of the above were addressed the democrats would still struggle in this media environment.\n\n10. And most importantly\u2026 personally I do not trust in the democratic establishment to take any of the above seriously (with few exceptions) or change their positions to meet these moments.",

Democrats on the other hand have to really fight to get people engaged.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason Trump pushed back on mail in sooooo much leading up to 2020.

Really poor people get some social safety net benefits and the rich are, well, rich. Working class people feel inflation more acutely than most and wages have not kept pace like it should considering the gains by big business. After Covid and the recession, housing costs, etc , people want change. Radical change. The kind of change Bernie Sanders has been talking about for years. It became obvious after Obama did not usher in the changes people hoped for, and then establishment Hillary was pushed on to the nomination despite her unpopularity, the Democratic Party was not going to get behind radical new ideas. But who was? A con man that would say anything to get a vote. He tapped into the realization that most Americans, particularly low education Americans, are almost solely concerned with their own personal situation and would support him if he said what they were feeling in their hearts. They know he is a con man and an all around piece of shit, and doesn\u2019t mean anything he says,  what he does say gives them a kind of hope, and that\u2019s what people vote for. Hope. They don\u2019t want to vote for him but after Biden hung on too long and then Harris was a take it or leave it candidate, a continuation of the status quo, they  rejected her and went back to their abusive boyfriend. Even though he cheats and lies and generally treats them with distain, there is the small hope that he will shake things up and make it different. At the end of the day, people are just animals that want to be safe and comfortable. Many democratic leaning people who saw the same old same old, sat out. Trump gained ground in every group except black women. Something like 15 million just didn\u2019t vote.

He just talked about his love of golf, talked to his black caddy like he was the best in the business and how Trump respected him, and then Trump talked about how beautiful some of the trees were on the course and his favorite singers. He came off as a normal dude who was just loving life in that moment golfing for charity. That's not really the evil monster picture that media outlets painted of him.  When there are other forms of media that are open ended and unedited, you get to see who people truly are and not what narrative the media wants to shove down our throats.

Democrats lost margins in every demographic, every racial base, 99% of blue and red counties, and every cross-tab except college educated women (barely). \n\n\n\nWe need to start fixing this now. A lot of these \"you'll get what you deserve\" and \"America revealed it's horrible\" messages do nothing but deepen the Democratic circlejerk and further alienate most voters. Dems don't need that, they need to win. \n\n\n\nIf Democrats are in power, better social justice will follow. But they need to get in power first.\n\n\n\nExisting Democratic policies are very popular. More than enough to win elections, as this article shows. \n\n\n\nBut the messaging recently has been too entirely focused on the social issues and evils of Trump as a person. This isn't working. \n\n\n\nThe only demographics Dems improved on in the election are college educated women and people making over 100k. The post-covid recovery has been very uneven, and the gap between those doing well and not have widened. Only those privileged enough have the capacity to vote on others' social issues. The bulk of voters vote on their own priorities. We need to speak to their priorities better instead of just lecturing them.\n\n\n\nI've been doing some exit-poll research. Very few new Trump voters did it to support him. Nobody did it because they want fascism, or want to harm women or migrants or Ukraine.\n\n\n\nOverwhelmingly, they voted Republican for themselves. We shouldn't be asking \"how could you support XYZ horrible thing\" and we should be asking \"what are your needs\". \n\n\n\nWe shouldn't be telling them about Trump's latest disgusting behavior but telling them how Dem policies will make their lives better. \n\n\n\nInterestingly, Trump's turnout and votes from his base dropped a lot since 2020. He more than made up for it with new voters and flipped independents. Those paying attention on both sides are rejecting (or tired of) his hatred and messaging, yet there are a LOT more voters who are simply less engaged who overwhelmingly voted for him. Not because they wanted a fascist, but because they want lower taxes, lower prices, a better economy, and safe borders (related to economy). The Dem response needs to address these issues, instead of focusing on Trump/GOP's negatives (voters are exhausted/disbelieving and won't engage) or protecting marginalized groups (LGBTQ, Trans, Migrants, other countries, Geopolitics, etc). Abortion as an issue works for women voters but that's about it.",

Try to explain to people that don't care that they've already fixed it? They didn't really say the claims were made up, they just said the economy was in good shape, which it is. They had to get people angry that prices are up to realize that once prices are hit with inflation, they don't go back down. It's just not an easy thing to get across so they clearly didn't try.\n\nIt's far easier to be critical of the ones in power than it is to defend what you've done in power. Average voters were never going to understand inflation was already a solved problem and that Trump wasn't going to be able to actually fix things by lowering prices back to 2019.\n\nTrump got voted out because people were unhappy with COVID in 2020, Harris lost because people are unhappy with inflation.

Dems can never respond to the crazy shit he says because they're still trying to figure out how to respond the crazy ass thing he said previously. Just lie. Nonstop. Doesn't matter. Flood the zone with shit. People with low critical thinking skills will eat it up, especially if they think it's funny. If you keep doing this you can destroy democracy by denying reality. You can then rebuild society as a totalitarian oligarchy. Even better, the people you tricked into following you into this new slave state will probably blame it all on the party that was trying to stop it from happening.

On paper the economy was trending better, but people are feeling the pinch from inflation and think things are getting worse.",
         ">Obama powered through the prejudice because he's arguably the most gifted politician since Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan. Kamala doesn't have anywhere near his charisma.\n\nExactly, and we need to be calling this out more. These are Dem candidates that have won in the last 100 years *without* inheriting as VP from a dead president:\n\nFDR, JFK, Carter, Clinton, Obama, Biden\n\nAside from Biden, who was a bit of an anomaly due to 2020 dynamics, that's an insanely charismatic lineup. We Dems don't win by running low-charisma candidates. We don't run by running old, establishment-branded candidates. Our entire brand is based no reform and we're completely sabotaging it with our candidate selection. So far this century, we've had:\n\n* Gore: Low-charisma bureaucratic heir to previous admin\n* Kerry: Two ultrarich East Coast lawyer bros named John turned professional politician\n* Hillary: Low-charisma lawyer dynasty heir to previous admin (party tried to block Obama hard during primaries so they don't get credit for him)\n* Hillary *again*: Low-charisma lawyer double heir to previous admin turned lifetime politician. Also, most people prefer presidents in mid-to-late 50s and she was older than people liked the first time around. She was almost 70 the second time.\n* Biden: Low-charisma (due to age) lifetime politician lawyer heir to last administration who first ran for president 36 years ago and was considered too old when he lost to Obama.\n* Harris: Low-to-mid charisma California lawyer career politician heir to previous admin who came in near-last in the primaries, the only opportunity anyone had to vote for her as a candidate\n\nGood luck playing the young, charismatic, reform-minded party when those are the messengers we choose.",

The Democratic candidate who can appeal to every single left-leaning people doesn't exist. Another candidate may have been more appealing to you but less to someone else. So if you didn't vote for her, whatever the reason (too far left, too far right, not picked up by you, woman, non white, complicit to \"Genocide Joe\", didn't solve the Israel/Palestine conflict, did a bad campaign, didn't appeal to whatever demographic group you feel you belong to), that's your choice and your responsibility, so everything that will happen from now on because of your choice is on you.\n\n\n. If you voted for Joe Biden in 2020, you know how vile and dangerous Donald Trump is. He was your President for 4 years and he poisoned the life of your country for the next 4 years. He made no mystery of what his intentions are should he ever come back to the White House. And yet, you deliberately rewarded him by giving him basically unlimited power (new appointments to the Supreme Court, the Senate and probably the House of Reprensentatives). So everything that will happen from now on because of your choice is on you.\n\n\n. If you voted for Joe Biden in 2020, you probably know enough about Donald Trump's \"vision\" for your country, including his total disdain for the environment and by extension the rest of the planet. He will do his best to actively destroy what's left of nature in the USA for profit and doing so accelerate global warming and thus affecting the lives of the billions of human beings and living creatures who share this planet with you. Thank you for that.\n\n\n. If you didn't vote for Kamala Harris because of Gaza, I sure hope you took a few minutes when you made your choice to think about the very real people who live there (and maybe about Ukranians, if you have enough compassion in your heart). I wonder what they're thinking about the people who sent the man who said to Netanyahu to \"finish the job\" and who worships Putin back to the White House. Well done.\n\n\n. Now the rest of the world can say, without any doubt, that a majority of Americans either recognize themselves in Donald Trump's \"values\" or are perfectly fine with it as long as an imperfect Democrat doesn't win. You probably don't care but still : Congratulations. Oh, and consider yourselves lucky if you still get free and fair elections again.\n\n\nTo all the people who voted and/or fought against Donald Trump and the Republicans, I am truly and sincerely sorry and heartbroken for you. I hope you'll get through the dark years ahead as safely as possible. And thank you.",

Democratic leadership thought they could run with their own personal goals instead of actually putting forward popular, transformative policy. We have seen our rights slowly being eroded by ideological sycophants and instead of running against it, the Harris campaign kept assuring we would provide a seat at the table for them while pushing for right-wing border policy and maintaining an internationally recognized genocide that is threatening to pull us into another forever war in the Middle East all while putting forward no real policies that benefit the average American.

And, I am sorry, but if you had a 401K during the Biden administration and lost money, that is totally on you, as you went in there and messed with it vs leaving it alone and allowing the investment company like Vanguard or Fidelity manage it. \n\nI literally have done nothing but increase contribution percentage as recommend by those advisors and mine has doubled since 2020.\n\nEdit:  I just want to add that after that interview none of the hosts (Turr, Jansing, Mitchell) did not push back on that comment. They did not have to blast that person but they could have came back with a quick factual statement about both of those topics. \n\nBut none of them said squat. This is part of the problem too.

She referenced it several times during the debate.\n\nBut it's good; Trump had concepts of a plan for Healthcare at the debate after being president and failing to get the ACA repealed several times.",
         "Yep, that has been a tactic in the past (for both sides!). But with control over the presidency, senate, and even possibly house\u2026that\u2019s not a tactic that will be as easy to deploy. Actually having \u2018full\u2019 control will probably bring the policies in to sharper focus easier/quicker, because the majority that I have seen will not impact working class people positively.",
         "That's just a DNC narrative. The democrats as a whole party have been weakly sliding right for decades refusing to lead people. They're not inspiring people be cause they keep offering to be a compromise that isn't inspiring.",
         "Yea because they ran a campaign with Liz Cheney",
         "Unless they could profit from it",
         "Trumps entire brand is about \"taking back the government from the forces of evil\" and he's done it. Red all the way around. When his camp fucks the country into the ground, there literally will be nobody left to blame but them",
         "I mean those two are hated more by MAGA than the Dems are lol but yeah spot on",
         "I think their standards are different...",
         "How do you figure that? Do you think nothing bad happened at all, otherwise why do you think it did not affect them?\n\nTons more people died than necessary during early Covid due to his administration. The largest shift in economic disparity in the history of the US. Openly corrupt supreme court taking corporate handouts. Over 100 environmental regulations rolled back. Massive layoffs in the tech sector. We have people dying due to restricted access to reproductive care.",
         "At least you guys can step back",
         "Yep. I wish Americans cared that we have such an important responsibility to the world, not just the country. \n\nWhich I don\u2019t mean in the \u201conly America can protect democracy\u201d way, but in the honest \u201cAmerica\u2019s capitalistic tentacles stretch far and wide in global affairs and we have far too much power than we should\u201d way. \n\nForeigners paying attention to American politics are smart. It affects everyone.",
         "Sorry, we forgot how dumb a lot of Americans are. Perhaps they won\u2019t keep taking democracy for granted after this.",
         "Because the Democratic Party needs to cut their own cancer out before dealing with Republicans. MSM, alternative news, and influencers are making their money constantly shitting on Democrats. This has to stop.",
         "I agree with this. If you can\u2019t even spend a small amount of your time to do something as simple as checking some boxes, you\u2019re basically forgoing your basic responsibilities as a citizen.",
         "Or a white woman, for that matter.",
         "They already tried republican tactics and it backfired horribly. Stop focusing on how bad the other side is, and show people what is good about your party. Dems just expected to win and shunned anyone with a slighlty differing opinion. Now they are doubling down on their toxicity and blaming everyone but themselves.",
         "Non voters are a result of an uninspring candidate and campaign. The extremety of trump shows just how bad the democrats have performed to lose against him again. Even now, all you can do is blame non voters. It's like you don't actually give a shit about winning, you just want to feel superior.\n\nIf you are as smart as you claim to be, you would realize this, but instead you'll just insult and blame everyone else until you lose again.",
         "Maybe you\u2019re not wrong, but it\u2019s also them telling us not to believe what\u2019s in front of our eyes. They\u2019ll say the economy is good because the stock market is up, but actual people are struggling to afford rent, buy groceries and gas, own a home. They\u2019ll say they have record low unemployment numbers, but ask any normal person and they\u2019ll tell you the job market is terrible. I don\u2019t know why this is a hard concept to understand. But I truly believe not understanding this concept is the reason why we got blown out. It wasn\u2019t even close. I think that has less to do with her being a woman, and everything to do with the messaging of the campaign, and the fact that we didn\u2019t get to choose our candidate, and havnt since the Obama era.\n\nI\u2019m not saying it was a bad campaign, I\u2019m saying it wasn\u2019t the *right* campaign.",
         "That\u2019s an interesting conclusion. Should the Democrats get rid of men or stop running woman candidates if they want to win? Women are 0-2 for the presidency, men are 60-0. You will never find a solution if you\u2019re looking at the wrong problem.",
         "I agree it\u2019s a 100% on the media as well for normalizing Trump over the last decade, and holding a double standard.\n\nTrumps message wasn\u2019t any better, and in reality was far worse, but that doesn\u2019t matter when you can sell people on the idea. It\u2019s politics man, it\u2019s about how you say it, not what you say. Apparently how Trump says things convinced a lot of people, and we cannot deny that. \n\nWe can sit here and call him dumb, racists, xenophobic. Say what you want about him, but he got people out to vote and that\u2019s what truly matters at the end of the day. We are living with those consequences now. Blaming the voter is only going to just push more people to the other side. It\u2019s a nuanced issue, and saying it\u2019s solely because she\u2019s a woman is overlooking a lot of the bad decisions Dems have been making since 2016. This style of campaign didn\u2019t work for Hilary, why the fuck would it work now?",
         "The truth is that the average voter doesn\u2019t care about identity politics. They don\u2019t care about the Middle East or the war in Ukraine.  They don\u2019t care about taking the high ground. They don\u2019t care about anything that is not effecting them directly. And that is proven time and time again when Trump wins. Is Trump actually going to make their lives easier? Fuck no, but he convinced them that he would. It\u2019s like the Dems didn\u2019t even try to capture that vote, we sat here and called them garbage idiots. Blaming the voters assumes that a majority of the population are sane, reasonable, intelligent people. Anyone that goes outside for 5 seconds or been alive in the last 10 years knows that just isn\u2019t the case. And this election has only proven that further. A billion fucking dollars. Gone. \n\nBlaming the voters is only just going to push more and more people to the other side. That\u2019s exactly why we\u2019re in the position we are today.",
         "The truth is people are happy or at least nonjudgmental about the character of their president as long as they get cheap eggs.",
         "On your last point, couldn\u2019t agree more. I think a good place for the dems to start is actually letting them choose who they want to lead them. Corporate backed candidates the dnc forces on people is clearly not working.",
         "I\u2019d say you\u2019re right, but an overwhelming amount of women showed up for Trump, so it\u2019s not like it was only men voting for him because of misogyny, although I think that certainly factored in to some extent. I think that had less to do with identity politics, and everything to do with Trump selling them the message that their lives will be better. It\u2019s wrong, of course, but the main job of a campaign is to energize people to vote, and Trump apparently has something that the Dems don\u2019t. We should learn from that.",
         "IIRC Poland is a NATO country, but Trump will probably pull us out of that pact before his buddy invades",
         ">Poland has been preparing for this for a long time.\n\nI wouldn't say a long time. They demilitarized heavily after the fall of the USSR. They only started to rebuild their military in the past few years.",
         "yeah, it can be difficult to discuss \u201cthose at the bottom\u201d which is where our family came from. \n \nshe\u2019s now a 6 figure CPA and as such her lifestyle has crept into wants becoming needs because she\u2019s \u201cgot the money\u201d\n \nshe\u2019s not heartless by any means. perhaps lost touch at how time consuming living in poverty is.",
         "Yes, I'm realizing people may have interpreted what I said as critical of DEI. That's not what I intended.  What I mean was it was never pushed as a government imperative.  Organizations decided independently it was in their interest to implement. I always feel like \"liberals think it's a good idea\" and \"democrats in government are forcing us\" get troublingly misconstrued.",
         "In case you haven't noticed, lack of knowledge is a greater power.  \nI don't know who you're trying to educate here, but it's clear the already educated were simply not up to the task.",
         "Yes educating people is important. But the reality is most people are not smart enough to be educated to a level to combat the modern era\u2019s amount of misinformation. Not to mention the structure of American society that will not allow people to develop that level of critical thinking. With both sides of the equation fatally flawed, this will always be the inevitable outcome.",
         "Fuck works.",
         "I assume the hamberders will catch up to him before then.",
         "Yeah. Although Canada isn\u2019t necessarily the top of my list either, just might end up being the only option.",
         "Just ignore the news say 6 days a week then briefly check in one day spend 20 minutes reading something like the bbc world news to see what is going on. Realise everything is still crap. Continue ignoring it for the rest of the week  you need to know what's going on in the world. You don't need to be told every 20 minutes though. Works for me.",
         "It occurred to me to just also remove any subs that trigger. i think if everyone takes this approach\u2026 corporations will get the hint as well. They spent the money to finance where we are.",

         "Yes that's true. In his first term I didn't expect him to accomplish anything because he had surrounded himself with incompetent yes-men. \n\nThis time I worry that smarter people have had time to plan how to use him in their own evil plots",

         "I've said in another thread, when it all goes to shit, and my father and stepmom (moreso her, dad voted party, she is 1000 percent team Trump) complain of shit going bad, I will sit them down, look each one of them in the eyes, and let them know they get what they deserve.",
         "The deregulation is going to be a problem for all. The environment is going to go to hell in a hurry. Won't be fun.",
         "Yeah I know, everyone will be effected including me, but some demographics MUCH more so than others, and unfortunately the demographics that voted for Trump will most likely be the ones to suffer the most from his policies\u2026",

         "that's getting quite normal these days. the only moral abortion is my abortion...\u00a0",
         "This should be the Democrat's slogan. Every single time Trump can pass through a horrible bill their only communique should be a prompt, bold-lettered \"Hurt, don't it? Signed, DNC Chair\"",

         "But your point is we have to let mass deportations start. At this point we can\u2019t stop it. So we just have to step back. I am personally against mass deportations. But at this point a slight majority wants it so have at it.",
         "His minions attacked the capitol building, and he was rewarded with the presidency. An event we saw in real time. His supporters (many of whom were there) gleefully blamed Antifa later or the FBI, or Biden, or bad actors, or whoever. I seriously doubt that Republicans will care with mass deportations. No doubt they'll find justify it.",
         "The ones who will complain and be actually heard are the wealthy who rely on immigrant labor. The horror of it unfortunately won\u2019t matter to many.",
         "I agree. I don't think any Democrat could've won. But they have a good shot in 2028 with buyer's remorse, assuming we are still allowed to have free elections",
         "I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll believe it\u2019s real - or at least \u201cnot that bad\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s what they say every time Trump does something bad or outrageous. That\u2019s why we have fake news and alternative facts as a part of our political discourse",
         "Exactly they voted for lies and feelings\u2026 Not policies that can actually be implemented.",
         "Right? Even the most far reaching, rural citizens should have at LEAST heard about all his charges, cases and convictions. I rather all his voters just admit they KNOW and don't care and will vote for him no matter what he does or says.",

         "I\u2019m not saying mistakes weren\u2019t made, but to say they didn\u2019t address infrastructure and manufacturing is patently false. In the end, I think the biggest problems were Biden deciding to run despite being deeply unpopular and then dropping out too late, and inflation. Not much chance to overcome those factors no matter the campaign that is run.",
         "Fox, uh, finds a way.",
         "But they'll blame anyone else regardless.  \n\n*They are not rational people. They are in a cult.*",
         "That's what people keep saying. But in 4 years when things go to shit, it'll just be blamed on Biden, Harris, maybe even Obama and the Clinton's for good measure",
         "Well when /if those teriffs kick in. A recession starts and they\u2019re all out on their ass like in 2008. But somehow it will still be someone else\u2019s fault.",
         "Yeah they see him as a generational talent",
         "I'm Canadian, this shit gets back to us too.",
         "We can step back from some of the direct fallout. \n\nHowever, when Trump decides to deregulate and put US consumers at more and more risk, we will need to also consider deregulation, so we can continue to compete - on our joint race to the bottom where our populations are least protected. \n\nOr the tariffs, which of course are mostly to show the US electorate who is strongest, once they are in place it will impact both US consumers and EU exporters. \n\nAnd where Trump shows how being far-rights can work, others will listen, watch, change their tactics, and make us more and more far-right too.\n\nI can\u2019t work out if the above counts as direct or indirect fallout and whether it matters. Trump is going to fuck things up for most people - not the oligarchs and dictators of course - they are in for a fun time.",

         "I wonder if America's allies are going to go back to not sharing intelligence with the Trump administration ?\n\nhttps://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-second-term-us-election-us-allies-b2635690.html",
         "While I agree the messaging didn't work (because they lost), I think they just need to dumb down their proposals. Just say the buzzwords \"lower taxes, cheaper groceries, fix inflation, secure the border\". You don't even need an actual plan. Shit, Trump doesn't have a healthcare plan, it's been 10 years, and he still says he's going to deliver on it.... and people BELIEVE HIM!",
         "Non voters took knowing action through inaction, and they share blame in the result. The stakes were too stark, you aren't absolved from responsibility because you weren't inspired to get up off the couch, it was a negligent thing to do and not immune from criticism. The people of this country made this mistake, and we need to take ownership of it",
         "Right. So as you've laid out, the average American is completely economically illiterate. How did you all forget the entire global economy ground to a halt 4 years ago and that the ramifications for this have been and will continue to be felt today onwards.\u00a0\n\n\nIt's not hard to understand the sentiment you've laid out, but the reason for that should embarrass you: Americans are too ill-educated to understand the world they live in, and will vote (or not vote) against their own interests because they don't understand it **but think they do**.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0Dunning-Kreuger, the country.",
         "All of those issues were talked about on the campaign trail by Harris with specific policy proposals around them.",
         "Republicans vote no matter what, democrats only vote if they feel inspired. \n\nThats a voter problem, AND a messaging problem. \n\nDemocratic voters need to just stfu and vote. And the DNC needs to let go of all the fucking dinosaurs running the show (fienstein, pelosi, biden, etc etc etc) and pass the torch. \n\nAll democrats are responsible for this, voters and ppl running the show. Each of us has to take responsibility here.",
         "If the US truly pulls out of NATO, any semblance of international peace and security will shatter with it. The promise of NATO is what prevents foreign aggression toward any member states, and without the strongest military in the world as a part of it, that promise is essentially worthless.",

         "I\u2019ve been saying that we need to bring civics back to every grade level in school for the last few years and I still think that\u2019s a great start. It\u2019s going to be a long slog but if we can educate children then it will grow from there",
         "I'm inclined to say insulting your base would be a bad strategy, but I guess it gets you into office these days, so why not.",
         "The beer hall putsch",

         "> The ones who will complain and be actually heard are the wealthy who rely on immigrant labor.\n\nRs will never allow \"the good ones\" who come here and work for sub-human wages and living conditions, to get rounded up in camps or deported.  Those wealthy Rs that rely on them are Trump's donors, precisely because it buys them \"selective enforcement\" when all this starts.\n\nThe fix is already in, for the people you're talking about.\n\nIf, for example, they rounded up ag workers and encamped or deported them, and food prices started shooting up or there were shortages, even low information voters would take notice.  Can't allow that to happen.",

In the end, I think the biggest problems were Biden deciding to run despite being deeply unpopular and then dropping out too late\n\nI wholeheartedly agree.\n\n> and inflation\n\nThis is where I disagree.  It was about inflation because Trump defined the conversation to be about inflation, even though inflation ended up coming down.  \"Inflation\" is just a codeword for \"people have less money\".  If the Democrats ran on a populist message that explained loudly and clearly that it is corporate greed, low wages, and wage theft that is causing people to have less money today, then they might have a chance at winning.",
         "Hopefully we'll serve as an example.",
         "You guys will insulate yourselves from most of it. It started happening 16-20.",
         "They're going to leave us behind.",
         "Exactly, less focus on how bad the opposition is, more focus on things that appeal to helping the majority, not heavily focusing on issues that mostly benefit the interests of a minority.",
         "Have you considered that not everyone gets all their news from the same biased sources as you? Have you considered that the media and democrats have lost credibility with how hyperbolic they have been with their over reporting? Why are you so heavily defending the loss and looking for someone else to blame?\n\nIf people didn't vote they probably aren't as scared as you and it is the fault of the democrats for constantly trying to scare them with fear tactics. I don't think insulting them will have any further effect. If it makes you feel better to do this, then great, but it won't win you anything or gain you any support.",
         "Sure, but a huge problem was the sense that she would do no different than Biden. People look at their paychecks and decided that\u2019s not gonna work. On a grand scale inflation is relatively better in the US than elsewhere, but with wages not keeping up people are still not in a good place. If you look at all the individual counties in PA that flipped from blue to red, they are all places where wages have not kept up with inflation. The answer is there, but I can\u2019t make you believe it. People look at Biden and ask why wages haven\u2019t kept up, and decided if he can\u2019t do it, Kamala sure ain\u2019t. \n\nIs Trump going to do anything to alleviate that? Fuck no, but he sold it well enough that people believed him.\n\nI\u2019m not arguing Trump is a better candidate, I\u2019m saying that he just simply connected more with his messaging. Why? I don\u2019t fucking know.",
         "Sure, I absolutely agree that placing blame wholly on one thing or another is not productive. The dems have been making bad decisions for a long time. And to me, where we are today is a direct consequence of the decisions made by the party. The big thing moving forward is: let the dems primary who they want. They need someone that will cater towards populism because that is what is pulling in Trump supporters. People are sick of corporate shills feigning that they have your best interest at heart. People see through that. It\u2019s a big reason why we lost in 2016, and a big reason why we lost in 2024. \n\nPeople got out to vote for Obama, so I don\u2019t want to hear that Dems are incapable of voting. But, you have to give them a reason to vote other than \u201cI\u2019m not that other guy\u201d. And I\u2019m not saying that messaging wasn\u2019t there, but obviously it didn\u2019t connect with voters in the way it was delivered.",
         "That wouldn\u2019t change anything. We have reading in every school yet the average reading level is like 6th grade. You are trying to use human made systems to change fundamental human nature. It\u2019s like trying to break a law of physics. People will always be dumb. Trying to make a strategy that can change that is impossible. You can only try to prevent the inevitable oscillation from one idea to the next.",

It's time that you finally see what the fuck you kept yelling on about. Enjoy it. Those of us that are smart enough to know better sure will.",

         "I keep saying this, Blue states will be fine, it's the Red States that will have the issues. But no one is listening!\n\nI just want to point out something to a lot of people that might not understand this. While this is the beginning of the next presidency, it is also the end of this storyline. The Republican Party is at a crossroads with itself and it splintering down the middle. One side you have moderate Republican who wants to move the country in a direction of conversation with Democrats and the other side you have the radical Republicans. The party is going to cannibalize itself.\n\nAs for the people that voted for the Republican Nominee, I want to point out a little thing that you might not have thought about. While you are all for deporting migrants, we need to remember that the economy will not stay afloat without those individuals. 1) Migrants make up only 18.6% of the labor jobs in this country. That is not a number that is hurting our workforce. 2) Migrant jobs include working on farms and construction sites as well as mines, factories, food preparation, cleaning, and child care. Here is where Republicans made their mistake.\n\nIf the deportation of migrants happens, the farms, construction sites, factories, mines, food preparation companies, etc. will have few things that will occur:\n\n1. **Getting rid the migrant workers will eventually cause these companies to close.**\u00a0Why? These companies will be getting rid of their work force that is paid off the books. These companies have bult in paying migrants off the books that they would not be able to handle paying the same amount of people on the books. Result: Companies crash, farms in the Red States no longer function, prices of goods produced by the company skyrocket, people can't/won't buy their goods because they are too expensive, local economies crash, the Red States cannot function.\n2. **The companies keep the workers but have to provide them with Green Card Status.**\u00a0Why? They do not want to get rid of their labor but now they have to pay them a livable wage. Result: Green Card Status increases, the migrants become citizens, which means they vote, Red States will see shifts to Blue.\n\nSo what does that mean? Well, Republicans who felt that voting for the Republican Nominee would lower grocery costs, it won't. It will cause them to increase. Coupled with tariffs, getting rid of the CHIPS and Science Act, you're looking at being a lot worse off than you were the last four years.\n\nSo where does this go? The next four years will be an embarrassment, but Republicans will not be voted in as President for a long time after this. No one will be able to inherit the Republican Nominees cult because they have not been able to yet. The Red States population will decline because they will be moving to Blue States to feel protected. This is the end of the Republican Party.\n\nThe important thing to remember is that there are still circuit judges that in place that are Republican that have no problem standing up to the Republican Nominee. Democrats will take the White House back in 2028 and all three branches. In 2026 we will take back the house and senate.",
         "I've heard everyone say blame the DNC for this, but I have to be honest, I'm not buying it. When everyone suddenly decided Biden was too old for the job, I can not wrap my head around the idea that holding a primary before certain states made them lock their candidates was feasible. I think what most likely happened was that party democrats in power heard almost everyone say they didn't want Biden after that debate performance and went with the only alternative they could possibly get to it time. And, to their credit, they actually went with someone who was on the primary ballot instead of pulling a candidate out of thin air, which would have been arguably more undemocratic than at least sticking with someone voter's voted for in the only viable primary.\n\nPut that together with the fact that Kamala ran a decent campaign free of too many major embarrassments, I honestly believe that the only reason it turned out this way is because the pocketbook of the average American is hurting. Bottom line is that people voted in 2020 for a return of pre-covid prices, and while inflation slowed to a more acceptable pace, wages didn't keep up enough for the average American to not feel the burn. If everyone is wondering where the votes disappeared to, I honestly think it's people just dissatisfied with the state of their bank accounts and little else; the simplest explanation is that Americans are hurting and they don't feel heard. (And the majority don't look further to figure out why they are hurting, or what is being done, other than what the people in power tell them). \n\nIf you want to hold onto power, you have to make the people giving you that power happy that they gave it to you; without that, there was just a ton of indifference this time around.",

It's one of those things you don't hear about anymore, but you know those family graves with multiple young kids and infants dead in quick succession? A lot of those were diphtheria.\n\n\nOr as it used to be called, the strangling angel. Because the thick white-grey membrane that grows in the throat of a child with diphtheria flutters like wings when they try to breathe. It closes a small throat over very quickly. They can't breathe past it. Their breath gets trapped as much as they can't draw one at all. They get these round, puffy necks that close the throat even more until they're breathing through a gurgling straw. Then they're dead. It doesn't take long.\n\n\n\nEven if they survive, we're talking infants and small children suffering days deprived of healthy oxygen levels, suffocating to near death over and over and over. With all the knock on\u00a0effects you might expect.\n\n\n\nIt's also very, very contagious and very lethal. Before the modern era of vaccinating every person\u00a0against it, a family could easily lose five out of seven kids in a year to waves of diphtheria. Even with all the benefits of modern medicine - even with! - the fatality rate is still 5% to 10%. The main treatment is antibiotics.\n\n\n\nHow many people will be able to afford access to those antibiotics without the ACA? How many people will\u00a0be able to get those specific antibiotics even if they can afford them?\u00a0\n\n\nHow many people who voted Trump realise that they voted to realise a future where they sit up with their dying, suffocating babies for days on end, using their little fingers to puncture those strangling wings every ten to twenty minutes, hoping\u00a0their bluefaced, bullnecked child has the strength to\u00a0draw just one more breath?

It's not going to be better under Trump. Inflation will probably hover near where it's at now until his tariffs cause the price of goods to spike \\~20%+ and cuts to the safety net, healthcare and regulations are likely going to chip away from American's pocketbooks from the opposite direction. Lastly, a Republican administration is not going to fight for any policy that will help the middle class or the poor.

Ballots blasted across the country without any validation. Ballots received after midnight. Counting that stopped and started at strange hours of the night and kicked out poll watchers. Counts that took many days to validate. No voter ID, or even signature verification on mail in ballots. Warehouses of ballots disappearing, making audits impossible. \n\nI did not vote for Trump in 2020, but I saw what was coming. I told myself ahead of time. \"There will inevitably be legal contests. (as there has been in many past elections.) If any of those trials reaches discovery, I'll be content with the result.\" \n\nThen watched in horror as every. single. trial. was dismissed before discovery. Not a single election trial was dismissed on the merits. Some of the Trump lawsuits were dismissed for contradictory reasons.

All the while on the federal level Republicans obstructed any and all efforts to streamline voting rights.\n\nVoter suppression is unfortunately real and it's a lot more difficult to prove than voter fraud, because there is no evidence and the victims are ephemereal. It's a very safe route legally when compared to tampering with votes directly, and the Republicans made their bet on it because Biden won 2020 on tight margins, so their main preparation for 2024 was splitting off those margins. They challenged absentee ballots, they argued that provisional ballots should be thrown out and mail-in ballots were slowed down or even lost (a Trump appointee was left in charge of the postal services by the Biden admin).\n\nWhat sucks is...

In total, between the two parties  there are only 88 million or so registered voters, the country  though, as a whole, has 168 million registered voters. That means that about 80 million Americans are registered but with no party affiliation.\n\nA total of around 140.5 million votes were cast. So, non party affiliated voters swung this race. So technically, more voters chose Harris than are registered as Democrats. But, more voters, by about 3 and a half million over Harris, voted for Trump. Trump therefore got about 33.5 million non registered voters compared to Harris who got about 19 million non Dem registered votes.\n\nThe swing voters, those fickle independents, are what swung the race. In 2020 everything that was going on was fresh and in the minds of those voters....4 years of stability and inflationary economic forces from the post pandemic snap leeched concern from the non aligned voters.\n\nIt will probably result in a House switch to Dem, but that isn't going to do shit in the Senate.

There was also a fair amount of this one \"being in the bag\" going around with mostly positive news for Harris being reported towards the end, so people said screw it and stayed home. Beyond that, she didn't appeal *at all* to the undecideds and people mostly cared about their grocery bills, which they felt Trump would do a better job at fixing - which I'd say is probably even short-term true as he sacrifices long-term investment in the country to bolster it only during his presidency. My guess is that he's going to dump American oil reserves onto the market to push gas prices down to ridiculous amounts, which will undercut our negotiating power with the middle east long-term (also a win for his Saudi backers).\n\nI ramble, but I mean - this all makes sense as we get to sit here and look at it in retrospect.",

         "Between Trump and Vance?  Yes.  **FUCK** yes. \n\nVance is a self serving shell of a human being lacking in morals and integrity that is almost literally a meat puppet for financial interests and policies favoring his billionaire donors. He will destroy decades worth of progress towards the good of the common person, will stack the Supreme Court with fanatics, and will wreck the US on the international stage. \n\nDespite all that, he still had a cognitive basis in reality. Vance sold his soul for power, but he knows he did so.  Trump is a true believer, and is comprehensively divorced from reality.

         "I really don\u2019t know, but if it technically has to be confirmed then I believe so. I guess that if the VP is needed for succession, you just skip it and go to the leader of the senate; but for example to confirm the next election? Maybe you still go through the line of succession?",
         "I feel personally its less about self importance and more about tax cuts / breaks or control.    \nThere is a good reason all these rich old types sink so much money into controlling media and opinions.   \nThat was acheived and this is the result.",
         "On my state\u2019s page I can scroll down further and see my entire voting history, including my participation in 2024.  I have seen screenshots from other states where if you mail in your ballot it will tell you what stage your vote is at (sent, received, accepted, etc)",
         "You're welcome.",
         "The Speaker of the House is next in line for succession, but yes, it would simply skip over an absent VP. For the record, the VP slot has remained vacant during multiple US presidencies \u2013 including the entirety of the terms of Tyler, Fillmore, Johnson, and Arthur \u2013 so there is definitely precedent for such a scenario."

A system that he is a master of manipulating and stalling, he ran this election like he was going to die if he lost because if he did lose then he would lose these cases and most likely die in prison. He won and thus all his tactics, manipulations, and abuse of the system paid off. \n\nEvery country has these issues, this is just the first time it's been something so massively major in the US.

That is a given.\n\nIf you look at the rest of the TV news industry, you basically have opinion shows on MSNBC that do a pretty good job of covering Trump and contextualizing what is happening. This was a big change from 2016 in my opinion and I think it was conscious. The problem is that the people that watch MSNBC don't need the context, most of them already know it.\n\nBut everything else, from ABC, CBS, NBC News, CNN, even NPR and PBS are all still doing the \"both sides\" thing. They report the talking point as if it is news. They will give credibility to something that is just objectively not true by reporting on it and then allowing it to be debated. They also frame what Trump says in ways he did not say it or just simply pretend he said something else that is coherent. That is all a massive problem.\n\nAs for newspapers? Their relevance dips every single week as fewer and fewer people read them, and really read at all. The headline is the best they can hope for from 95% of the population, and even those are now starting to get both sidesy.\n\nWe need a press that will tell people when something is unconstitutional. That won't allow people to come on their air and lie. That won't change what people say in order to prop up their legitimacy, and we really need to stop allowing places like Fox and Newsmax to call themselves news if they are really just going to be propaganda.\n\nI have no idea what will happen in the coming years, but the press is highly unlikely to be rewarded by this administration for the service they did for Trump this election cycle.",

He's an awful person, and he's said awful things.

The only way the president can overrule a Supreme Court ruling is by electing officials to the Supreme Court. All of our Supreme Court officials are under the age of 75 with three of them being women under the age of 65 do you really think any of them are going anywhere anytime soon?\n\nAccepting that the power is now with the states is something I have had to come around too , especially for the poor women in Texas, but I can see how more power has been given to the people in those states to choose. Many states across the country had abortion extensions on their ballot, and although all of them did not pass ( like Texas), most of them did and it was based on the choice of the people in that state. This Country is not sunk based on this one issue and I would encourage women to understand their state abortion laws and get out in their community and be politically active there to fight for what you want. \n\nAll states have abortion has a right if the woman\u2019s life is in danger, most also have medical exceptions and rape and incest.

         "Some sadly voted for him, too. I recently found out that a colleague, a black middle-aged woman, mother of 5 children, is a huge Trumper when we organized a trip to vote together with the students.  \n\nMy ed team and other staff in the deans office also dissuaded the students from voting, almost preventing them from leaving the building.  They insisted on them having chaperones, which they didn\u2019t require, at all.  \n\nThe 20something staff were so disaffected when I sent them to do one thing: take the students and help them to vote, they decided, instead to order pizza and bring it back to the building to eat it when the pizza place was actually closer to the voting place and they could have resumed the line to vote following their meal. It was across the street. \n\nThey were totally consumed with eating, stayed in the cafeteria for two hours missing their opportunity to vote, and it was astonishing what poor example they set. It\u2019s weird and wild how idk what to call it-not entirely lazy but like crazy and lazy and stupid all at once they often are regarding teaching students civic engagement.\n\nThe following day, I insisted they try again but sent someone else to vote with them (a retiree aged staffer and a 30 something staffer) because the younger staff couldn\u2019t manage to wait in line. \n\nAdditionally, the behavior team had a strange group of middle-aged black men who were \u201cboth sides\u201d-ing the kids upon their departure. So wild, too and astonishing because normally they cannot wait for us to leave on school field trips.  \n\nThey were going back and forth with me on the walkie, insisting the students \u201c***don\u2019t know what to do***\u201d \u201c***have no direction***\u201d by the school counselor, also a bizarre bully of a person, Jewish decent, mid twenties, and the behavior management team as well as security(Security mind you is a retiree, a woman.) I just said very loudly and calmly,\u201d****THEY KNOW WHAT TO DO****\u201d One of the subs asked who would go, and I responded, \u201cYOU ARE GOING\u201d and bless his heart he said \u201croger THAT\u201d\n\nHad I gone on this outing, I would have never made it out of the building with my students, at all due to the anti education rhetoric many at my school espouses, weird qanon conspiracies and blatant misogyny and racism under the guise of \u201cimproving the economy\u201d. My boss and his boss are not this way, but a fair amount of people in the building are. \n\nThey also bizarrely couldn\u2019t manage to pick up pizzas that they ordered from across the street, asking an old man, a sub to walk to the restaurant and carry their food back to our building. \n\nI\u2019m just so sickened and baffled at so many people that just think that the economy (Goofy they think Trump will save it as well, because he fucked up the economy his first term.) is more important than anything else, even democracy, even basic human rights.\n\nJust to clarify, my students are legal adults and have full cognitive abilities, just some mental health issues.  I obliged, but even then they made it so difficult that two of my students just didn\u2019t vote after being excited to initially for the first time. \n\nIt\u2019s frightening how many people are brainwashed across demographics. It\u2019s not just white dudes, gay guys, Latinos, it\u2019s like everyone has a subset that has been brainwashed by Trumpism and fascism.",

If Democrats wanna be mad at someone they should be looking at Obama who had three branches of government all Democrat who could have easily solidified it into law. However he stated it was not a priority for him. It could be argued he did that so it can be a topic in every election and a way for Democrats to win votes. There are other topics we must start taking about in all elections going forward outside of abortion. I want to hear clear coherent debates on policy where things can actually change.",

This is a gross oversimplification, but I want to say that what happens with minority groups and women who \u201cfall\u201d for Trump rhetoric and propaganda is more nuanced than the rest.  We often see subtle hints that these groups want to identify with the majority, which is an empowering feeling for them.  \n\nNobody wants to be a \u201cminority\u201d or feel marginalized.  So one seemingly more common approach by minority groups is to OVERCOMPENSATE for their otherwise second-class status among majority groups in social circles.  Make no mistake about it, this is a classic form of Stockholm Syndrome whereby the person with little to no power begins sympathizing and defending their oppressor.  The purpose being a survival mechanism that is profoundly rooted in a desire to empower the victim to a status equal to their master.\n\nWhen I saw Hispanics, women, and other minority groups vote in overwhelming numbers against past norms and for Trump - I began to realize the sickness was growing. Hispanics want to be seen as normal \u201cwhite\u201d Americans are. Blacks want to be seen as normal \u201cwhite\u201d Americans are.  And some are willing to replace their entire upbringing and cultural identity in favor of an idea that empowers and uplifts them from the shackles of marginalization.\n\nBut what they will find is an even greater oppression than they\u2019ve ever had before - an insidious corruption of self and personal identity that will rob them of any liberty they still had.\n\nTragic",

These are dumber than your average American Americans who don't understand economics and read at a 4th grade level.\n\nThe Democrats have got to learn how to talk to these people or they'll keep voting Republican forever and Dem leadership will just keep letting it happen. Dumb down the message, repeat the same words and phrases again and again, and make it clear that they're poor because of Republicans. Scare them and push hate/anger towards the rich too while you're at it. The Dems can't keep praying for an Obama level orator to come through and save them they need to learn how to win elections.",
         "Almost every commercial I saw from her was about economic shit. Almost every ad I saw from him was about economic shit too...with some stuff about trans kids and athletes at the end. Every time I saw Tim Walz he was talking about unions and bringing back jobs.\n\nThe economy was the main topic in this election by far. Biden actually did a great job. America has had one of the best recoveries from COVID in the whole world. The problem is that Americans don't FEEL like he did a good job. They FEEL like Trump will do better.

Nobody around me knows her economic policy, regardless of what did or didnt actually happen. Thats relatable regardless of who is on the ballot.\n\nThis is all anecdotal of course, but I was stunned by some of the convos at work today.",

         "IMO and i might be talking out of my ass but kamala was asked something along the lines of \"is there anything you would have done different in the past 4 years if you were president\"  and her answer being \"No\" that i saw in ad after ad after ad .. the average lower/middle class uniformed voter will hear that and think nothing is going to change... price of eggs goes up..  \nMeanwhile something I heard from trump (which i tend to avoid him) was no tax on overtime pay.. that resonates with them and is simple to understand.",

         "People on here dont want to admit it, but as much as people blast Trump voters for being easily swayed and buying into their own fantasies about him, we have a similar issue on this side of the aisle. Kamala was for sure the better candidate by being Not Trump, yes. You should've voted for her for that reason, yes. But so many people basically gaslit themselves into believing she's this wonderful perfect candidate that was everything to everyone and everyone will love her for it. \n\nShe was brat, she was queen... She was also pretty much running on a 2008/12 Republican platform. Strong man interventionist military, hardline literal Republican Bill Border policy, private Healthcare, a rejection of the Green New Deal and promotion of fracking. All to court the mythical moderate Republican who voted 95% for Trump again anyways or didn't vote.\n\nLook I was guilty of this to. I bought into some hopium as well just so I had something to cling onto in the hopes that at least basic decency would still prevail. But the time for that is over. It's time for us and the Democratic Party to take a hard look at how to win back the common man who doesn't like politics but goes to work everyday, comes home to his kids and looks at how rough his bank account is. You can blame abstract things like racism and sexism all you want, and it's certainly a part of it, but things didn't just become like this overnight. It's not like Dems have never won before under these conditions. Donny didn't gain more followers, but 10 million+ less people voted blue this time just compared to 4 years ago. What made those people completely tune out this time? I feel like there are pretty obvious reasons that can be addressed, but so many are just looking for excuses instead of inwards and trying to improve.",

They are doing what they are because incrementalism is what actually gets things done and helps us move toward real achievable goals. Based on these election results, the idea of some  revolution that brings about instantaneous widespread change on any longstanding issue is a pipedream.

To me it seems that a lot more people than usual tuned out. Those google searches for \"did Biden drop out?\" come to mind. More people than we'd like to admit didn't know about \"eating cats and dogs\" or \"floating island of garbage\" or were misinformed about it.",

Global economy has shifted and certain jobs are fading away from America. Part of that is corporate greed. If a company can save a ton of money by moving their production overseas then that is what they will do. \n\nSome working class people just want the old world back. They don't want to adapt. Democratic policies have largely been about adapting to the changing world. Getting green technology could do that. Solar panels and wind turbines need to be manufactured, hauled, installed, maintained, etc. These could be great working class jobs. Educating people for the new economy. \n\nRepublicans tend to argue bringing back the old days. Bringing back the factories and coal and what not. The reality is that certain fields will never be the same as they were unless we create new economic sectors with new job opportunities. \n\nAnother thing is that Democrats tend to be very pro-education and pro-college. To a lot of small town working class people, that is elitist and they don't like that. \n\nDemocrats absolutely care for the working class, results show that. The problem is that many working class people don't like what the Democrats are selling and Republicans have figured out how to exploit that feeling.",

         "A big issue is that effective governance is not flashy or sexy. It's mundane policy decisions there keep things moving and slowly adjusting things to keep everything stable. It doesn't make for interesting reading and it doesn't have a catchy sound bite. Ask a conservative candidate a fix for the economy and they say \"tax cut\" even if in the long run it's going to screw over the working class. As a liberal candidate then it turns into needing to explain the tax code and how increasing taxes on higher brackets will offset a child tax credit that they are proposing so the deficit is not going to balloon.... and now the low information voters glazes over because their knowledge of US tax code is if turbotax says their tax return will be bigger or smaller at tax time.",
         "Yeah, for sure. Democrats have a completely different audience that appeals to completely different things and demand better but on the same note Democrats absolutely can say things that fire up the base.. No one minded one bit when Kamala called Trump unhinged, a nazi or a fascist. In fact, those were probably some of her strongest points in the campaign. Tbh I wish she went heavy on the LOCK HIM UP chants instead of shushing them because that's what the base wanted.",

         "Fair something needs to change though. They need to stop running from the base and being cowards. The infuriating thing is she had the chance to. No one knew who she was. Instead she tied herself to Biden way to much and ran for Republicans and away from the base",

         "This is a recurring historical trend. Right wing socioeconomic policies (laissez-faire capitalism) lead to social dysfunction as more and more people either fall into poverty or fear doing so. The mainstream right can't win elections on these policies any more because they have become unpopular, but rather than change those it either allies or becomes the extremist right (authoritarian and reactionary), going all in on distractions and scapegoating.\n\nThis leaves the social liberals (pro-capitalist but not socially conservative) and the social democrats as the only democratic factions to counter them, but the former block most major re-distributive policies and even the most moderate moves towards a fairer society have to be fought over tooth and nail. This alliance (either as intra-party in a two party or as a coalition in multiparty systems) then fails to do enough to keep their voters on board, disillusionment sets in, voters stay home and the extremist right takes over.\n\nFortunately, it doesn't always completely run through this cycle, but it keeps happening. It has now happened to the USA and the best case scenario is that when those lukewarm Trump supporters are angry at not getting what they wanted out of this \"change\" (and they won't), they will still have the means to vote the government out. If not, then you're stuck until a revolution happens.\n\nArguing that more social democracy would have scared away voters is sort of pointless IMHO, because if that is true then you're doomed anyway. Unless you lower economic inequality through government policy, a descent into reactionary authoritarianism is inevitable because democracy can only work when people are more or less equal and capitalism left to itself will always concentrate wealth and power into ever fewer hands.",

         "Bernie is spot on with this and we can see how the Democratic party has been taking actions that have lead to the current situation we are in:\n\n     In 2016, many within the Democratic Party felt that the primary was unfairly tilted towards Hillary Clinton, who was historically and at the time unpopular. The Republicans, on the other hand, had a competitive primary and seemed to listen to their base.\n\n     During the general election, Trump and the GOP campaigned heavily in the Rust Belt, speaking to the concerns of the working class and promised to address them (even if it was a facade). Meanwhile, the Clinton campaign took these voters for granted, focusing on \u201cHer\u201d messaging and courting higher-income and college educated voters who didn\u2019t typically vote Democratic.\n\n     As the working class began leaving the Democratic Party, feeling ignored, they were often called racist or sexist for supporting Trump\u2014even if they were mainly looking for someone who acknowledged their economic struggles.\n\n     This persisted through Trump\u2019s presidency and into the 2020 election. Trump benefited from a strong economy pre-COVID, which was likely caused by Democratic policies under Obama. However, recency bias often effects the party in power, which helped Trump\u2019s appeal to some.\n\n     In 2020, the Democratic primary again felt tilted, with Biden as the perceived favorite. During the general election, Biden won over upper/middle-class and college educated voters, helped by the pressures around the pandemic. However, the GOP continued gaining support from the working class, minority groups and women.\n\n     Biden inherited a volatile economy due to the pandemic and faced resistance in Congress that limited his ability to pass policy. Those that did pass weren\u2019t seen as helpful or quick enough, so people new frustrated. Many recalled the relatively strong economy under Trump and compared it to their current situation.\n\n     In the 2024 primary, Biden chose to run again rather than passing the torch, and the Democratic Party blocked any real primary competition. While the GOP already knew and supported Trump as their candidate as he remained popular with their base. This was something Biden was struggling with. After a rough debate performance, Biden was replaced, not by any of the 2024 primary candidates, but by Kamala Harris, who had dropped out of the 2020 primary and was already viewed as part of an unpopular administration.\n\n     Harris ran a competitive campaign and tried to reach the working class. Many found her insincere, and the labeling of dissatisfied voters as racist, sexist or fascist continued. Trump gained even more working class support, including from minority groups and women. Harris struggled to motivate both the Democratic base and middle-class voters.\n\nWhile I skipped over some factors between elections (2022 midterms, international events, SCOTUS decisions, etc.), I believe these choices by the Democratic Party have driven voters towards the GOP.\n\nP.S. I believe Bernie was the Democratic Party's answer to the downfall of Neo liberalism, like Trump was for the GOP. The Dems just stopped him and the movement, where the GOP embraced Trump.\n\nTL;DR: The Democratic Party\u2019s strategy of prioritizing college educated and middle class voters has alienated the working class and non college educated voters. When these voters turned to Trump, they were often labeled as racist, sexist or fascist. They are now frustrated, feeling left behind economically and rejected by a party that once claimed to represent them. Additionally, the lack of real primaries (starting with Bernie Sanders) in the last three election cycles has left many Democratic supporters feeling disenfranchised.",

         "Bernie gives far too much credit to the voting public.   Reality doesn't matter to voters. Perception does. It doesn't matter how much Democrats actually do to support various demographics, Republicans will claim otherwise and most of this country will believe them. \n\nLogic is no longer apart of the average voters decision process. Buzzwords, fear, misinformation, and oversimplification are how you get modern voters.\n\nPeople constantly want to blame the candidates, or the party or the media.....but the reality is that the American public is just too stupid for an effective democracy.",

The current Dem leadership all needs to go. The game has changed.",
         "Honestly, if you look at the people who thought the economy was bad in 2020, they overwhelming voted for Biden because Trump was the incumbent. Those who believed similarly about the economy in 2024 voted overwhelmingly for Trump, because Harris was seen as the incumbent. Sure, there are other issues that mattered around the edges (LGBTQ, crime, immigration, a woman's right to choose, etc.) but ultimately the exit polls indicate that the economy decided this election.\n\nSo, it really had nothing to do with this \"Kamala wasn't liberal enough\" thing that Bernie and others on the far left on pushing. Biden certainly wasn't more liberal than Kamala and he won 300+ electoral votes just 4 years ago. We haven't suddenly abandoned working class voters during his term.\n\nIf there was one big thing Kamala should have done, it is dramatically distance herself from Biden. But hindsight is 20/20.",

That needs to be addressed.\n\nFocus on the economy, first and foremost, and win back the Gen Z voters. Make housing affordable. Improve their quality of life.\n\nI'm not saying abandon those other issues, but those issues shouldn't be at the forefront until women prove that they care enough to actually go out and vote.",

The problem is, the dem party is weak and complacent, which is why they keep lying to us about what they're going to do after they're elected and don't give a rats ass about any of us. It's because they're taking us for granted.\n\nLook at how scared the Republicans are of their MAGA base, it's because they're loud and willing to come out en masse and protest to bend their representatives to their will. We need that on the left. Until then, the dems will just keep sending out weak, feckless losers and then blame us for not voting hard enough.",
         "Voters want a strong economy and a strong dollar, and to be able to afford a middle class or better lifestyle.  They think Trump will give that to them.

Its too bad that Trump voters walked into a rake though.  Trump is not really a populist.\n\nAlso, Democrats: Elections are important. You can't demonize the other side as being anti-democratic, and have the backroom deals where you pick your candidates. It was too similar to 2016 and the base was demoralized from the entire handling of the Hilary/Bernie fiasco.  The time for Biden to step down was before the primaries.  After the primaries it was too late. \n\nThere is no better vetting tool than robust primaries to allow a candidate to dip their toe and check the temperature of the electorate, and see who can win actual elections.",

Came out to ~85% or so (again, not accounting for paying taxes).\n\nThen they updated the costs to a bare bones existence in 2024. Came out to IIRC ~47K. Net. So pre-tax more like 55k. That's where the equivalent of 1980s poverty is today, despite the laughable federal poverty level of 15k(single) to 31k(family of 4).\n\nThe median yearly pay in the US is ~38k. And as you pointed out, full time at min wage is poverty even under the massively-too-low current poverty line.\n\nIt's pretty plain to see, despite whatever propaganda and misleading bullshit that you hear, that our economy is in shambles, that the **majority** of people are living in poverty that we refuse to recognize.",

         ">when those lukewarm Trump supporters are angry at not getting what they wanted out of this \"change\" (and they won't), they will still have the means to vote the government out.\n\nThe problem is that Trump supporters' perceptions of whether or not they're getting what they want out of a Trump administration will be determined in large part by them taking the cues of the fiction generated in the media they consume.\n\nThe average Trump supporter's life probably did get noticeably better during Trump's administration, not because of policies or measurable outcomes, but because the media they consume nearly 24/7 took a hard 180 from the 8 years of presenting the illusion of a pending collapse at the hands of the incompetents in charge to everything being sunny and full of roses. Then four years later it was back to the nonstop doom and gloom. That sort of immersion has a real effect on your psyche.\n\nFox News isn't just presenting a version of reality in the best possible light for the GOP, they're actively and aggressively wagging the dog. If they want their voter base agitated, they consciously agitate. Want them complacent? They calm them. Expect a deluge of arguments from the right that the economy is now magically fixed the day Trump takes office, because that's what they're going to be told.\n\nThere does come a point where addressing reality becomes unavoidable, but people who think we're generally anywhere near that point lack imagination. By and large, despite the overall economic anxiety, people have jobs, they have a roof over their heads, they have nonstop 24/7 entertainment from their 6 different streaming services, and they're not going hungry. That's enough of a recipe to manufacture their contentedness.\n\nOn the other hand, the result of elections involving Trump has had more to do with pushing turnout than with converting his cultists. Trump didn't get more votes than in 2020 - it looks like he got quite a lot less. It's that the opposition didn't show up, for reasons both strategic and acute. The incumbent dropping out of the race at the last minute and the sitting VP, who was the 9th place finisher in the 2020 primaries, taking over, is never going to be a recipe for driving enthusiasm.\n\nThat plus the obvious observation that Trump is mortal, and much of his support dies out when he does. He is showing signs of advanced dementia already and not much younger than his dad was when he succumbed to it. It's not realistic, I think, for a lightweight like Vance to carry his momentum forward, and no other heir apparent to the MAGA movement has appeared (in no small part because Trump's ego won't allow for it).",
         "This is exactly correct. \n\n> Sanders: \"It should come as no great surprise that a Democratic Party which has abandoned working class people would find that the working class has abandoned them.\"\n\nHe's right, of course, but it didn't happen in a vacuum.\n\nThe Democrats were the party of the working class from 1933 till 1984. They dominated elections for 50 years running on the New Deal until the GOP found the opening it needed during the civil rights movement. That was just the wedge issue the GOP needed to start carving up the working class. Southern Dixiecrats fled into the open arms of the GOP. Right to work laws diminished unions. The GOP increasingly used social wedge issues such as abortion to carve up the Democratic working class base. Walter Mondale (1984) was the last New Deal democrat. \n\nAs things got worse for the working class, the GOP used AM talk radio and Fox News to blame anyone but the GOP politicians the working class was increasingly voting for.\n\nStarved of voters and funding, and no longer needing to appeal to a socially conservative base, the Democratic party pivoted from the New Deal to so-called New Democrats (Clinton) which constructed a coalition from socially liberal but economically conservative wealthy urbanites, plus Black voters who were loyal to Democrats for advancing civil rights, and a traditional but shrinking union working base.\n\nUnder Clinton, the party got too far in bed with corporate America. It would continue to sell out the working class, hoping to make it up for it with more urbanites and voters of color who while not naturally Democrats for social reasons, didn't feel at home in the GOP.\n\nBut the Democrats would continue to hemorrhage white working class voters as it adopted trade, economic, and social policies that benefited capitalists more than they benefited labor.\n\nObama started to turn some of that around, but was saddled with an imploding economy and an Iraq War that he inherited from terrible GOP policies. The Obama administration also didn't address the anger in the Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street movements. \n\nSo we got Trump in 2016.\n\nBiden was a real return to the Democrats' traditional support for pro-labor policies, but it was too little too late. There were obviously issues of age, and many other missteps made by the Democrats.\n\nAnd here we are at Trump v2. People are _angry_. But Trump and the GOP will not bring them the relief they seek. The GOP does not represent labor. Never has, never will.\n\nSo yes, the Democratic Party abandoned the working class, but that was only after the working class started to abandon the Democratic Party.\n\nI don't know how we find our way back, but I really hope this is our bottom.",

Who the hell is Kamala Harris's constituency? Who is her support base? What's her brand? The results of this election seem to show that she didn't have one. Which is unsurprising, given that she was one of the worst performing candidates in the 2020 primary, and had incredibly low favorability ratings throughout Biden's presidency.

The [Taft-Hartley act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taft%E2%80%93Hartley_Act) was passed by republicans AND conservative democrats from the South coming together to override a presidential veto.

Businesses actually sharing profits with their employees, strong unions, those things are what let the middle class develop in the first place.

They're only hope otherwise is to do this back and forth every 4 years after everyone is sick of Republican rule.

One of the smartest among us, a captain once sent me a text with a link to \"save the children\" (Qanon) early in the game. I was kind of shocked. There's no changing them I don't think.

I say assume because we didn't ever talk politics.",
         "Yeah, but that\u2019s the bar for Democrats because you\u2019re working with more educated group while trying to court less educated group. So you need a candidate who can satisfy both.\n\nBill Clinton also fit into the mold. He would\u2019ve been remembered as a good president if he could keep his privates in his pants. \n\nIronically that affected Hillary\u2019s political career, as her tolerating the affairs pretending everything is good made her look cold to the voters, someone who\u2019s married for politics not love. \n\nI wonder if it would\u2019ve helped if she was a bit more emotional with the press about the topic back then. Tears are cheap but effective. Could\u2019ve written narrative of a woman in love who was hurt but recovered to run the country. \n\nWhich is unfair but that\u2019s politics.",
         "As I said in comment above, it\u2019s unfair but that\u2019s what Democrat president needs in this era. Look at Clinton and Obama, and to smaller extent younger Biden. \n\nAnd look at Bush and Trump. \n\nThe requirements for each party stands out in my opinion. Dem presidents are well educated political elites who connect well with working class because they are good at figuring out what voters want. \n\nRepublican presidents are ones who connect with voters because they feel like an average person who made it to presidency.\n\nUnironically they represent their core voting blocks well.",

         "\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 Today, there is no \u201cthey,\u201d only \u201cwe.\u201d We cling to that illusion of division like it\u2019s the last life raft, pretending we\u2019re not all slowly sinking into the same sea of chaos. Aren\u2019t we supposed to be Americans? Or is that just something we slap on the Fourth of July and forget about once the fireworks are over? As author and activist Arundhati Roy put it, \u201cThe war is not over; it is not even beginning; we are all in it.\u201d (Roy, Field Notes on Democracy, 2008). It\u2019s hard to pretend we\u2019re separate when we\u2019re all in the same sinking boat.\n\nAt some point, we sold our future for pocket change\u2014sacrificing any long-term hope for the shallow comfort of a few extra dollars today. A cheaper tank of gas, a little tax break, maybe even a handful of crumbs to make us feel like we\u2019ve won. And yet, most don\u2019t see how deep Project 2025 and those \u201cinnocent\u201d tariffs will cut into their lives. We\u2019ve become a nation so wrapped up in our own smugness, we\u2019re too distracted to notice the slow-motion disaster heading straight for us. As journalist Chris Hedges said, \u201cWe are a society that is on the edge of ruin, and the people are too distracted by the drama to notice.\u201d (Hedges, America: The Farewell Tour, 2018). The kicker? The ones who cheered it all on are going to be the first ones to feel the sting.\n\nIf this is MAGA\u2019s promised land, then sure\u2014bring on those falling prices, the affordable gas, the groceries that magically cost less. But my gut tells me that\u2019s about as likely as pigs flying. The idea that one person can \u201csave the economy\u201d while conveniently ignoring the rest of the world is almost adorable\u2014like watching a toddler believe that closing their eyes means they\u2019re invisible. As economist Joseph Stiglitz aptly noted, \u201cMarkets are global, and the idea that a single nation can somehow insulate itself from global forces is delusional.\u201d (Stiglitz, Globalization and Its Discontents Revisited, 2017).\n\nWhen the reckoning comes, at least we\u2019ll have the privilege of saying, \u201cwe told you so.\u201d Not that it\u2019ll make a difference. I can already hear the chorus of MAGA voices scrambling to point the finger at everyone else, even though they\u2019ve got the Senate, House, Supreme Court, and Presidency locked down. Watching them contort themselves to blame \u201cthe others\u201d when they\u2019re the only ones with their hands on the wheel will be an impressive spectacle\u2014if it weren\u2019t so painfully predictable. As political commentator Thomas Frank observed, \u201cBlaming the elites is a convenient way of not facing the reality that we, as a society, are complicit in this mess.\u201d (Frank, Listen, Liberal, 2016).\n\nThis country\u2019s moral compass is so broken, it\u2019s practically a modern art piece. We\u2019re hanging on by a thread, and any hope of a miraculous comeback feels like a bad joke. Whatever storm is coming, we rolled out the welcome mat. We earned it\u2014every dark, twisted moment of it. As historian Howard Zinn warned, \u201cThe problem is not that we are too few, but that we are too few who are willing to stand up.\u201d (Zinn, A People\u2019s History of the United States, 1980).  \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8",

Yes, that means government isnt responsive to voters on policy No, that isn\u2019t because of mythical liberals.

There were plenty of interviews and pressers during her time in the senate where she just didn't argue convincingly or coherently.  I voted for her out of necessity but honestly, she should never have been the nominee.  The Dems have twice now chosen the nominee through closed channels, alienating much of their voter base.  The DNC should have gotten their shit together long before Biden finally dropped out.  Instead they chose the woman who last dropped out of the primary with not even a percentage point.  \n\n  \nThey will point fingers and blame everything and everyone but the real blame lies with the fact that the DNC is still a bunch of crony capitalists masquerading around as social and fiscal liberals when it suits them.  Their milquetoast left-of-center policies will  NEVER fire up their base.  All they had to do this time was put forward a competent candidate who ran on progressive policies and emphasize what they could do for working class voters.  Instead the message was totally lost while they played centrist.  \n\n  \nBiden had the right idea.  He listened to Bernie Sanders, and while he wasn't going to adopt his policies outright, he did compromise, and supported many of his ideas.  That's how you unify your voterbase.  Biden and Sanders both understand the plight of the working class, while Harris just totally missed the mark.

It boils down to one of two things...too weak and incompetent or theyre in on it\n\nMy fear was the latter. If this happened it was bc it was allowed to happen. So my faith in any of them is gone. If Kamala couldnt do it with all the momentum and Trump looked dead then it will never happen\n\nAmerica spoke. This is who we are. This is who we want to be.

Hate and fear get results. Thats just reality\n\nIm not saying we should all turn to the dark side Im just saying prepare to keep losing bc theyve got full control and theres no way to stop them now\n\nThere isnt going to be a next time. Im seeing people say \"well we'll be done with him after this term\". Are you fucking serious? No. No we won't. The entire point was getting him so he'll be in until the day he dies\n\nThere arent going to be any rules for him to follow. No one is going to enforce anything. There wont be another election. Not a real one anyway. This is it. People just had to fuck around and find out\n\nAnd its not just the dems. Plenty on the right are going to realize it too soon enough. Too late. All the red flags and warning signs were futile. Now we got the worst case scenario\n\nTheres not going to be any coming back from this. The old America died on election night 2024. Better brace for the new America. If you want an idea of what its going to be like its exactly what we been saying\n\nTrump and his minions in control of everything with no boundaries. No one to say no. No one to stop them. Its a small club and we aint in it. Some people going to be in for a shock bc they havent been paying attention. Or maybe they dont think its going to affect them.\n\nAll I can say is we collectively failed as a nation and as a species. Keep fighting the good fight? Lol. The fights over. Theres no \"good\" left to fight for. And this country aint worth saving\n\nSo we're going to get what we deserve. All of us. No matter what side youre on. You either voted for this repugnant pieve of shit knowing what hes about or you failed to stop it from happening. It was a test. We all failed. We all lost.\n\nThe silver lining for me is knowing Id rather fail at doing the right thing than succeed at doing the wrong thing. No matter what happens I take comfort in knowing I never bent the knee to Trump and I never will\n\nThat could go badly for me in the near future but Ive made peace with that. Id rather die on my feet than serve on my knees. Im also removing myself from the equation\n\nIm done trying to get through to anyone. This is what they want this is what theyre going to get. Now just sit back and watch it unfold. Any.crying from either side will fall on deaf ears\n\nMay sound selfish but Im going to take care of me and mine and avoid as much of the shit slinging as possible. Gonna be difficult with all the dog shit policies that will get forced through but there will be some cold comfort in seeing his supporters go down as well....shocked that the leopard party ate their faces\n\nSorry if this sounds overly defeatist and pessimistic but this is the truth. Its something we all need to hear and accept bc the narrative of keep fighting and we'll get him next time is a lie. The only thing you can do is prepare and protect yourselves the best you can in the coming days\n\nA lot of people going to have targets on their backs.  You know who you are. Best watch your asses bc they will be coming for you. Im rooting for you but its looking fucking bleak\n\nGood luck to everyone. We're all going to need it",

She had an awesome VP pick and his VP pick is straight out of Handmaids tale and yet despite all of this, she still lost. Sure the Cheney thing was a mistake but not the cause of 15 million voters not showing up. I think the biggest problem was her being connected to the current administration. If it was other generic democrats(preferably male unfortunately), it would be a much higher chance for them to win but I do agree that the left needs someone charismatic.

Some highlights on Wilhelm II:\n\n>However, Wilhelm often undermined such progress by making tactless and threatening statements towards other countries without first consulting his ministers.\n\n\n\n>Despite strengthening Germany's position as a great power by building a powerful navy as well as promoting scientific innovation within its borders, Wilhelm's public statements and erratic foreign policy greatly antagonized the international community and are considered by many to have substantially contributed to the fall of the German Empire. In 1914, his diplomatic brinksmanship culminated in Germany's guarantee of military support to Austria-Hungary during the July Crisis which plunged all of Europe into World War I. A lax wartime leader, Wilhelm left virtually all decision-making regarding strategy and organisation of the war effort to the German Supreme Army Command. By August 1916, this broad delegation of power gave rise to a de facto military dictatorship that dominated the country's policies for the rest of the conflict. Despite emerging victorious over Russia and obtaining significant territorial gains in Eastern Europe, Germany was forced to relinquish all its conquests after a decisive defeat on the Western Front in the autumn of 1918.\n\n\n\n>Losing the support of his country's military and many of his subjects, Wilhelm was forced to abdicate during the German Revolution of 1918\u20131919 which converted Germany into an unstable democratic state known as the Weimar Republic. Wilhelm subsequently fled to exile in the Netherlands, where he remained  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm\\_II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_II)",

She was not great at communicating any loftier ambitions or methods of improving the country or tackling wealth inequality, and improving the economy folks are feeling unsure of.\n\nShe was not elected in a primary, and had very little place at the front of our ticket, especially so when you consider that Joe Biden did not win by a generous margin, and that she was the least popular runner up in the last general election\u2019s primary. The DNC chose for us, and without taking stock of the situation on hand, and we all suffered for it. \n\nTim Walz was a solid choice, and had a higher favorability rating than anyone in the candidate pool, but was further left and far more ambitious with his communication \u2014 which if anything just lays bare how unlikable and misguided the Kamala campaign was. She could have selected Shapiro, a candidate much closer to her centrist beliefs, who could\u2019ve actually voiced broader support for her more center policies (if that was truly the road the DNC wished to take) and pulled that Pennsylvania vote together much better. \n\nShe spent the last days of her campaign trying to push for centrist and a limited pool of non-trumpian republicans, by championing and promoting figures like unpopular Liz Cheney (who lost her last election against a further right Republican) \u2014 and choosing to water down and insult her base promising cabinet positions to republicans in the most divisive era of American politics, rather than champion for needed change and pride in democrat beliefs being a positive force of change.\n\nI guess she did okay with the circumstances, but just objectively hard to envision where DNC thought actual necessary grass roots support could come from with the style and direction of this campaign. Should\u2019ve given the people a primary, however possible, and let people rather than politics decide who is a good candidate.",

At the same time though, Dems were preaching about abortion rights, morally upstanding policies and causes, etc which is extremely important and something I'm passionate about but for a lot of voters, they just don't care about anything outside their immediate bubble which is \"what do basic goods cost me\".

Link it wherever you need to.\n\nProject 2025 is a transitional agenda \u201cprepared *by* and *for* conservatives who will be ready on Day One of the next Administration to save our country from the brink of disaster,\u201d according to the [Mandate for Leadership](https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_FULL.pdf) published by the Heritage Foundation. \n\nHeritage Foundation president [Kevin Roberts](https://youtu.be/81IQQytqDwM&t=19m42s) addressed a group called the National Religious Broadcasters at a Presidential Forum in February 2024. At around 19:42, he explains how the conservative think tank will use Project 2025 to help install 20,000 people to go into the next administration. He doesn\u2019t want to take credit, though. He wants that to go to Donald Trump and his Administration. \n\nDespite later claiming to have no idea who is behind Project 2025 [(July, 2024)](https://www.axios.com/2024/07/05/trump-project-2025-heritage-foundation), Trump went on stage to speak about thirty minutes after Kevin Roberts at this event. \n\nTrump\u2019s sudden memory loss is likely due to Kevin Roberts stopping by [Steve Bannon\u2019s podcast](https://youtu.be/BhhulOa97Xg) and saying, quote:\n\n\u201cI just want to encourage you with some substance, we\u2019re in the process of the second American Revolution, which will remain as bloodless as the left allows it to be.\u201d\n\nEven though he now claims he has no idea who they are, Trump enacted [60% of the policies](https://www.heritage.org/impact/trump-administration-embraces-heritage-foundation-policy-recommendations) suggested to him by the Heritage Foundation in 2018. \n\nMany of the architects of Project 2025 [served in the Trump administration](https://apnews.com/article/trump-project-2025-biden-9d372469033d23e1e3aef5cf0470a2e6#). Additionally, [Trump\u2019s Super PAC has been funding ads](https://x.com/ammarmufasa/status/1809252191837753590) for Project 2025. \n\nThe Mandate for Leadership, despite being almost 1000 pages, doesn\u2019t really detail *how* the Administration would accomplish any change within the government. To understand the actions members of the Administration would be taking, we have to look to the [policy proposals](https://www.heritage.org/budget/pages/policy-proposals.html) by the Heritage Foundation and authors of the Project 2025 framework. \n\nFocusing on veterans and servicemembers, here are some key proposals that should have your attention. \n\n[Privatize TRICARE](https://www.heritage.org/budget/pages/recommendations/1.050.93.html)\n\n[Replace 80,000 troops with civilians](https://www.heritage.org/budget/pages/recommendations/1.050.95.html)\n\n[Reduce the Basic Allowance for Housing by 66%](https://www.heritage.org/budget/pages/recommendations/1.050.91.html)\n\n[Stop DoD research into breast, ovarian, and prostate cancer, epilepsy, autism, and other medical conditions](https://www.heritage.org/budget/pages/recommendations/1.050.98.html)\n\n[Reduce commissary and exchange subsidy by 20%, and combine commissary and exchange functions](https://www.heritage.org/budget/pages/recommendations/1.050.97.html)\n\n[End enrollment in medical care for Priority Groups 7 & 8](https://www.heritage.org/budget/pages/recommendations/1.700.35.html)\n\n[Exclude Veterans from receiving disability due to arteriosclerotic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Crohn\u2019s disease, hemorrhoids, multiple sclerosis, osteoarthritis, and uterine fibroids](https://www.heritage.org/budget/pages/recommendations/2.700.24.html)\n\n[Limit initial application for service related disability to within 10 years following end of active service](https://www.heritage.org/budget/pages/recommendations/2.700.23.html)\n\n[Eliminate concurrent receipt of retirement pay and disability compensation](https://www.heritage.org/budget/pages/recommendations/2.600.22.html)\n\nBottom line: There\u2019s no guarantee any of these or similar policies will be codified into law during the second Trump Administration. But we know he\u2019s worked with these people to enact similar policy before. Buckle in, folks. Shit\u2019s gonna get weird.",

In the general case (i.e. not just issues affecting Veterans), the incoming administration will first go the easy route. If there is any discretionary (i.e. not Congressionally mandated) spending, Veteran, elderly, poor, or otherwise, then that spending is legitimately at risk in the short term; a pen stroke and it may be gone.\n\nBut for Veteran benefits a lot is baked into the cake legally, so I think that's much harder to change. He can slam the door on new or increased spending (likely), and possibly change the benefits for future Veterans. But I wouldn't bet for a moment that increased Veteran spending is on the agenda. That isn't a constituency he's given a damn about before, so seems foolish to think this time would be different. This is in distinction to defense spending, as it's both in his personal self interest (ego) and the industry will simply pay him off for the spending.",

There is no heir apparent to the MAGA throne (Vance may be VP but that\u2019s no guarantee MAGA follows him), and the inner circle is a dangerous place to be seen trying to consolidate power.

If you look at these local races they are tight and each district these folks are in they have to answer to things. They struggled with getting broad support for more draconian cuts in his first term including the ACA.\n\nIn the Senate, unless they get rid of the filibuster, they will need to have a 60 vote threshold for their more draconian bills. Also a small majority in the Senate could lead to some folks not going along with everything because they also may be in purple states. If they get rid of the filibuster they open the door to democrats retaking control and getting things passed in the future with no way to block them.\n\nThis brings us to reconciliation. You can get around the filibuster through reconciliation. A reconciliation bill has to be something regarding revenue, spending, or debt limit. That\u2019s all they can do. This is how they got the tax cut bill passed. It\u2019s how Obama passed the ACA. It\u2019s how the inflation reduction act was passed. They can cut spending and taxes through reconciliation but then you have to get close to 100% of your conference on board with voting on a bill because democrats likely won\u2019t vote for some of the spending cuts they want to put through. There will likely be spending cuts because Trumps tax plan would add significant to the debt but what those look like will need broad support. Veterans benefits I think would be toward the bottom of that list. It doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t happen but it\u2019s less likely versus potentially some other entitlement programs could have some adjustments to it. \n\nOverall I am not saying there won\u2019t be cuts to our government budget, but significant cuts in the range of what Elon Musk was talking about I don\u2019t expect those.\n\nAlso reconciliation there is a limit on the amount of bills per year they can do and most of the time you spend a lot of political capital and only get 1 per year maybe.",

The outcome is the same though.",

Veterns overwhelmingly voted for Trump who is gonna fuck over lots of groups, not just veterns, so you should be able to understand where the schadenfreude comes from. I am not American and I am in favour of helping veterans but you can't expect the left the make a great stand for your rights/benefits when that same group votes to take that rights and benefits away from others.",

They needed that for Harris. Show who she is more as a person. A one on one or just a couple people on a podcast without a crowd is big.

My father in law is the type of conservative that hates the idea of working from home because it's for lazy liberals that just don't want to come into work. He told me that there's this person he works with that demands to work from home when they don't even do work at work. My response was \"yeah, that sucks, they need to pull their weight. I'm actually frustrated the other way because my work's doing the thing where everybody's gotta come into the office. But the problem is that I'm working my ass off to get this release out, but now I need to take two hours out of my day to figure out how to get to this building to satisfy bureaucratic rules when I could be spending that time finishing this damn project\".

That isn't a difference of people voting for Trump, that is a difference of people not voting because the party and campaign did not give them a reason to. We don't have Covid and a current Trump administration to ramp up the fear and make that an easier job, so they had to run actual competent strategies to get their base out. Instead they ran to the right, embraced a incredibly small set of Republicans who couldn't deal with Trump again, and what was the result? Those people just didn't vote. And Harris lost a Massive voting block because the campaign didn't give a fuck about those people. They told us 'we don't care about your vote, you'll do it anyway if you know what's good for you, we only care about the republicans that are close to the middle'. It was a shitty, loser strategy that abandoned what helped them to win in 2020 when the race was undoubtable Much easier and didn't adjust for the current climate. \n\nThis campaign failed us and we're all suffering for it. I voted for Harris, but I Completely understand why so many others didn't because that's how humans work. If you don't give them something to vote for, 99% of the time they just won't vote.

If what matters to you is finding a little bit of secure footing when the economy in your own home is not doing well, it makes a sort of sense to choose a less appealing person, if you believe that their ability to deliver for you will outweigh their repulsiveness as a human being.

Go look at how Biden consistently fought and finally succeeded in raising the federal minimum wage to $15. Look at how his administration called out price gouging (all while being called a socialist by Republicans no less) which resulted in grocery prices lowering. Look at how it's only blue states which have raised their minimum wage. Then go look at how Biden continued to help rail workers get what they want behind the scenes. Go look at how Biden dealt with the dockworker strike. Go look at the legislative platform of the Biden-Harris administration:\n\nHarris supports the PRO Act, Trump opposes it. Harris supports PLA's and the Biden-Harris administration has mandated them on most federal funded projects, Trump banned PLAs on federal projects. Harris is against right-to-work laws, Trump supports a national right-to-work law. The Butch-Lewis Act saved the pensions of over a million union workers, Trump was against the Butch-Lewis Act all 3 times the law was presented to him, the Biden-Harris administration told congress they would not sign the American Rescue Plan unless the Butch-Lewis Act was part of it.\n\nThen go look at Trump introducing tax cuts skewed to the rich, not supporting raising the minimum wage, saying he supports firing striking workers, how he hates paying overtime and how he talks about supporting domestic manufacturing all while offshoring the manufacturing of his merchandise overseas.\n\nThese working class people still voted for Trump though. Go look at how the majority of union members were Trump supporters still. Dems didn't abandon the working class, the working class abandoned Dems.

But the things they're yelling about are a step removed from the audience. The people afraid of migrants are those who don't actually live with/around migrants and seen that they're just people. They're people that don't know any trans people, they just know the fear of a child being molested. They aren't seeing that 99.9% of protestors are peaceful and calling for an end to a genocide, they see the guy who went there to be disruptive to the protest yelling awful shit. But they mix it up. They change the target depending on what's new and scariest then go back to the classic later when it's fresh again. It's like what Trump does with his rallies, throw shit at the wall, see what sticks, and ram that down everyone's throats until you start doing it with more issues and rinse/repeat.\n\nThe Democrats fear tactic is different. It's about something you can directly see. Trump is going to take away your rights and ban abortion and give massive tax breaks to the wealthy while leaving you with higher prices. And these are actually true. But harder to message in the same way because people Live through this, it's not that step removed. We lived through 4 years of Trump. Prices were lower, there was a marginal tax break for some people. The fears that we're talking about take Time to develop instead of being immediate. Roe wasn't overturned while Trump was President, that happened under Biden. It happened because of Trump's Supreme Court picks, but it still happened later and without actual push back from the sitting Administration other than empty words. Prices/inflation didn't start going drastically up because of covid and the economic situation he put us in because those all take longer to develop, so they're harder to be definitive about. 'If he was going to do that, why didn't he already.' And while the immediate fear can help turn out voters, it doesn't hit the same way when the same message is put forth 4 years later. The things we were told were horrible about Trump didn't happen (ignoring that things didn't get worse because he wasn't there to keep making them bad, because we only think about the immediate 99% of the time).

It didn't effect them immediately. People want sweeping reform, real change, not half measures, promises or excuses.

Attempts to do so will alienate supporters and cause them to go \u201cWell, they\u2019re just as bad as the other side!\u201d Communists, socialists, anarchists and republicans tore each other apart during the Spanish Civil War, and the Communists and Socialists were basically having a civil war among themselves in 1930s Germany. Meanwhile, the fascists cajole, threaten, and bribe other right wing groups into falling in line, which then sends an image of unity and strength that attracts the so-called moderates who are frightened by infighting on the left.\n\nThis is also why Democrats struggle with messaging.

This year, the strategy plainly failed, according to exit polls from Edison Research.\n\nHarris only received 5 percent of Republican votes \u2014 less than the 6 percent Joe Biden won in 2020 when he beat Trump, as well as the 7 percent won by Hillary Clinton in 2016 when she lost to him.

A lot of these \"you'll get what you deserve\" and \"America revealed it's horrible\" messages do nothing but deepen the Democratic circlejerk and further alienate most voters. Dems don't need that, they need to win. \n\n\n\nIf Democrats are in power, better social justice will follow. But they need to get in power first.\n\n\n\nExisting Democratic policies are very popular. More than enough to win elections, as down ballot propositions showed. \n\n\n\nBut the messaging recently has been too entirely focused on the social issues and evils of Trump as a person. This isn't working. \n\n\n\nThe only demographics Dems improved on in the election are college educated women and people making over 100k. The post-covid recovery has been very uneven, and the gap between those doing well and not have widened. Only those privileged enough have the capacity to vote on others' social issues. The bulk of voters vote on their own priorities. We need to speak to their priorities better instead of just lecturing them.\n\n\n\nI've been doing some exit-poll research. Very few new Trump voters did it to support him. Nobody did it because they want fascism, or want to harm women or migrants or Ukraine.\n\n\n\nOverwhelmingly, they voted Republican for themselves. We shouldn't be asking \"how could you support XYZ horrible thing\" and we should be asking \"what are your needs\". \n\n\n\nWe shouldn't be telling them about Trump's latest disgusting behavior but telling them how Dem policies will make their lives better. \n\n\n\nInterestingly, Trump's turnout and votes from his base dropped a lot since 2020. He more than made up for it with new voters and flipped independents. Those paying attention on both sides are rejecting (or tired of) his hatred and messaging, yet there are a LOT more voters who are simply less engaged who overwhelmingly voted for him. Not because they wanted a fascist, but because they want lower taxes, lower prices, a better economy, and safe borders (related to economy). The Dem response needs to address these issues, instead of focusing on Trump/GOP's negatives (voters are exhausted/disbelieving and won't engage) or protecting marginalized groups (LGBTQ, Trans, Migrants, other countries, Geopolitics, etc).

It seems shocking, but sometimes people will choose someone who is diverse _because_ they provide a valuable perspective and voice first, and happen to be diverse.\n\nRepresenting all walks of American life (sans criminals) is what both parties should strive to do from the start, as a default. There should not be one party attacking the other from their inability to respect diverse voices and identities. \n\nThat said, there exist real issues in rural America that Dems simply haven't platformed strongly on, because they've been too busy playing defense against regressivism and the erosion of rights. \n\nFor that, ruralites are willing to sacrifice the virtue of diversity if it means they can put bread on the table for another day. You might too if you'd been left to hang as long as they have. \n\nSo Democrats need to look hard at how they connect with those outside the safety of coasts and major metropolitan areas. Somebody needs to roll up their sleeves and start sowing seeds alongside them, delving straight into the core of their issues, to find means to empower ruralites with merits directly attributable to Democratic policies and initiatives. They need to bring ruralites into the national conversation in a way that so far, only Musk and RFK Jr have.\n\nDemocrats need to _live_ the plight of America's small farmers to know best how to make their platform attractive. The first step is breaking up agri-chem monopolies. The second is ensuring better profits through efficiency. The third is making the domestic supply more robust and local-oriented by smacking down market-fixing practices and replacing them with sustainable techniques and access to resource networks.\n\nPaying attention to ruralites doesn't mean giving up the fight for rights and visibility, but it does mean putting their issues in the forefront of our minds as we would any other national security concern.",

They already take IDs, don\u2019t accept certain forms of payment, is still illegal nationwide, etc. For weed to be cracked down on more federal agents would have to come raid dispensaries and arrest users, and there\u2019s no way that would go down well even with republicans. \n\nAbortion on the other hand is something I would be worried about being made illegal nationwide and federal agents enforcing it in \u2018legal\u2019 states.",

         "A common argument against Voter ID laws is that voter fraud is exceedingly rare.\n\nI'm left-wing American and I'm not inherently against Voter ID laws, but they need to come under these provisos:\n\n\\#1. American citizens and non-citizens need to be provided these IDs \\~FOR FREE\\~. (Only citizens can use them to vote, voting eligible ones can have a special mark or something.)\n\nThe cost of a driver's license is $10-$89 depending on the state you live in. It can then cost $50 to renew that license, and must be renewed every five years.\n\nIf you make these IDs the backbone of our voting system, congratulations -- you have implemented a poll tax. The only way to ensure fair and equal access under an ID system is to make the ID free, and...\n\n\\#2. It is the onus of the government to provide their constituents with these IDs.\n\nThis is basically the main reason I don't generally support voter ID laws. I believe every American citizen should vote -- in fact, I believe that we should have a compulsory voting system like Australia. I don't know if everyone would follow me on that one. But! If we are to add another hurdle to voting, the burden should be on the government to lessen that load.\n\nBut I do not trust the US Government to take the steps necessary to make these ID laws not a burden.\n\nLet's say you have to go to a DMV to get these licenses. Who is to say that a Republican state senate in Alabama couldn't shut down DMVs in predominantly Black neighbors to suppress the vote? (Or vice versa in a blue state, but Alabama has a recent and egregious history of racially targeted voter suppression )\n\nWhich leads to...\n\n\\#3. Universal Voter Registration at age 18 for citizens.\n\nSuch a no-brainer and it should exist already. I think any Voter ID law that comes to the table without this already should be laughed out of congress. If you'd like to opt OUT of (or update) your voter registration, you can fill out a form to do so -- but every American should be opted into voter registration at the age of 18.",
         "Well, of course. If it goes his way, all good no fraud, if it doesn\u2019t go his way then it\u2019s voter fraud. One of the many reasons why electing a toddler in chief was such an idiotic decision by the country.",

It\u2019s unchallenged on nearly every thread and below nearly every high visibility Tweet, even though it is a complete hoax and borderline illiterate. And of course, people are using it to talk about voter fraud (which is exactly what happened in 2020 around this time, when it also looked like there were not many votes).\n\nIn reality, it looks like [roughly the same number of people](https://www.kgw.com/article/news/verify/elections-verify/unaccounted-2024-votes-20-million-18-million-fact-check/536-4a6cb71e-fb8d-4616-a848-f22c53ccf3b2) voted in this election as the last election.

         "I wonder what the army of the old Democratic guard, like Obama, Pelosi, Schumer, etc will do going forward.  They all marched out to back the candidate that they shoehorned in without a primary, brought a bunch of \"elites\", from George Clooney to Beyonce, AND even brought in super conservatives like the Cheneys to their cause and it made zero difference in the end.  Probably less than zero seeing as how 15 million **fewer** Dems came out to vote.  \\*It's time for a new strategy\\*.\n\nGive me meaningful policy proposals.  Give me facts.  Give me relevant precedent to the things that you're proposing.  Make people understand that it's not the illegal immigrants or trans prisoners that are screwing over their wallets but rather the fat cats at the head of billion (hell, now trillion) dollar corporations that aren't paying their fair share in taxes and aren't \"trickling down\" dignified wages to their workers.  60 years ago, the CEOs on average made 20 times what their average worker's wage was.  Now, they're making something like 365 times what their average worker makes.  I don't know about you, but my boss sure af does not do 365 years worth of my work in 1 year.  Make voters understand this disparity.\n\nDiversity, equity, and inclusion are important, fighting for people to have the freedom to live and love how they want is important, but we need to shift some more of that focus to the class disparity that unites the vast majority of us.  This was something Bernie has understood and been shouting about for literally decades (it's something MLK understood when he orchestrated the Poor People's Campaign), and it's the reason I canvassed for him in '16 and in '20.  The Democratic establishment put a lid on it both times because they thought they knew better.  It worked in '20, but Election night this year made it clear that we can't just campaign on the other party being a threat.  Don't just give people something to vote against.  Give them something to vote for.\n\nEdit: and just to drive my point further home, here's [Bernie in a Fox News Town Hall winning over the crowd with his \"radical\" policy proposals](https://youtu.be/jthr_9gIkKo?si=5tcht9r7rL0CgPAk).",

But no. Rich people take care of other rich people.

Well, it\u2019s time for Dems to ask themselves the same question. Why should we vote for people that have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo, even at the cost of losing their own elections?",

For American politics this is such a powerful slap in the face.  They lied, explicitly, in easy to verify ways, thinking they had a monopoly on the publics attention.  Their lies were so brazen that it was inevitable they'd be found out, it's literally things like cutting away half a sentence so that the meaning changes.  \n\nThey ran identity based hate, accusing black men of being misogynist for not voting Kamala Harris.  They accused white women of being aggressively oppressed to the degree where the only reason they aren't voting Kamala is because their husbands would beat them.\n\nAll of it portrays to this fantastical, reality free victim mindset that doesn't represent the vast majority of the public.  Most women don't consider themselves victims, of society, or the men in their lives, because most of them aren't.  I feel sympathy for those who are but your situation isn't the norm or the standard and if you think so, it's because you've been lied too.  \n\nIf you think Trump hates black people, then you're in the same boat.  Trump doesn't give two shits about black people, or latinos, or white people, he clearly cares about money and winning, and while that's childish it's an easy read and the broad range of vaguely fascist propaganda reads on the state of the world that has become that standard in liberal echo chambers is so detached from reality it's literally offending any liberal who's there out of a sense of intellectualism, or because they believe in a thorough social safety net away, because it's so obviously about a religious fervor of \"Were moral people, they're immoral, evil racist bigots\" that's both detached from reality and the most ignorant brand of propaganda rabble rousing.\n\nYou all collectively yawned when the Twitter files hit, but reality is that was a wake up call about how bad it's gotten.  This is barely short of the \"ministry of truth\" level bullshit and the explicitly lies, and frankly the bureaucratic stupidity that's creeping into more normal aspects of life, left no choice, to support the Democrats in this election would have been to support an attitude that the public is stupid and all they need is an identity politick message and they'll fall in line behind literally any agenda.  \n\nYou lost because you backed power hungry, lying politicians as they said literally any immoral, racist, sexist bullshit that they thought would get them a little boost.  They won't even admit it now,  no one is bringing up the misquotes, or the pro-censorship agenda, even at this point.",

The economy was never an issue Dems ignored. Their biggest flaw was being unwilling to lie like Trump was and just make simple and empty promises about lowering the prices of everything.\n\n>Social issues are divisive and aren\u2019t going to win you as many votes as you think.\n\nYes, they are, but go point out how many times Harris campaigned on social issues outside of reproductive healthcare. It's not Dems pushing the culture war.\n\nRepublicans are though, they spent hundreds of millions on anti-trans ads this election cycle. That includes Trump who spent 36 million on anti-trans ads in October (41% of the total ad spendng).\n\nIt's divisive and one side seems drawn to such hate unfortunately.",

MAGA focuses on incendiary social issues which it then hangs on Democrats, and like it or not, more voters fixate on these things.

How about \"we no longer believe in reviewing hiring decisions to see if racial discrimination is happening\". The public fixated on stuff like that though.\n\nThis campaign was anti-woman, anti-minority, anti-gay, and enough people either agreed with that, or ignored it because they were mad about their groceries, and also ignored the direction that Democrats want to go versus Republicans.

Fingers should have been pointed more strongly, and the reason for its failure hammered into people's heads. It should have been brought up at every public appearance that it was mostly the Republican party that blocked it. They should have enflamed people's frustration at these things to make them see.\n\n\nDemocrats get accused of \"extreme rhetoric\" when they're like Oliver fucking Twist before the headmaster, asking for goddamn concessions, and shrugging their shoulders when things don't go their way. If that's the case, maybe they need to show people what extreme rhetoric looks like on the left.",

According to a new report by Americans for Tax Fairness, 150 billionaire families have spent a total of $1.9 billion (\u20ac1.75bn) in support of presidential and congressional candidates this cycle, 58% more than four years ago.\n\n- Roughly $570 million (\u20ac525m) have gone to Donald Trump's campaign, $130 million (\u20ac119.7m) to Kamala Harris.

You are just making it clear the right choice was made, that we can't have any degree of sanity if we let this nightmare of explicit lies continue in the name of protecting minorities from a rabidly racist public that DOES NOT EXIST.",
         "Yup. The democratic establishment thought it was more important to trot out a bunch of fucking Cheneys than reassuring the progressive wing that they had any kind of respect in the coalition.",
         "If she was the right candidate, his failure to endorse wouldn\u2019t have mattered\u2026and likely didn\u2019t. There were literally millions of voters that registered for the first time to vote for Bernie in 2016 and most of them voted for Hillary.\n\nContrast with Trump. His own VP didn\u2019t endorse him and even ran against him. His former staffers were warning the country he was unfit and a fascist. He didn\u2019t show up to a single primary debate and even jerked off a microphone stand in the closing week at a rally. He just smoked his opponent.\n\nHillary lost because the vast majority of Americans were not excited to see her win. Even many who held their nose and voted for her. He could have endorsed her at any time and the effect would have been the same.",

I am from Michigan. talking to a couple election night about how it\u2019s such a different world when I visit home and they honestly have no idea what America is mostly actually like. Even rural PNW is still so different from rural Michigan - there\u2019s more of a libertarian streak here and there it\u2019s so much fundamentalist religion and overt homophobia.",
         "They are dead in the water. If they want to be relevant again in the next decade drastic measures need to be taken and soon.",
         "Same. I've tried to defend their actions over the years to various progressive/left friends I have who detest them. No longer. They are useless. \n\nTo be fair, some of the leftist criticisms of the DNC that I've heard *are* fairly poorly thought out and dumb, which is why I argued against them. But also, some of the criticisms were pretty good, and I didn't see that at the time. Well, I'm done with it now. This party is fucking useless",
         "Totally agree with you. Democrats don\u2019t understand that the game has changed. The old playbook doesn\u2019t work anymore. They need to take Trump\u2019s tactics and energy and apply with them with a progressive, worker-first, populist agenda.",
         "but sadly, people in the working class think HE does represent them. it's obviously a lie, but he wouldn't be able to convince them of that if the DEMs seemed like they had the back of the working class. they are the party who cares the most about the working class, but they don't care enough, so it's easy for him to swoop in and point that out and claim he cares, and they believe him because why not (in their logic, not mine). no one is helping them so why not hope he will. people always hope that someone is talking to them - he makes them feel like his is.",
         "Yep. Seems primarily focused on starting small businesses. Not everyone wants to start a business, nor COULD everyone if they wanted to. Ensuring a living, or better yet thriving wage for EVERYONE is where the focus needs to be. As well as fixing the goddamned housing!",
         "Right, as opposed to the comprehensive economic messaging of tariffs will solve everything?\n\nBecause Harris has outlined plans on how to create the opportunity economy, even during the debate. Or do we still want to keep pretending that people care or pay attention to actual workable policy?\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUZ-rbbyAIY\n\nLike I said, Harris failed by not realizing that voters cared the most about getting prices low, which is why her message of getting ahead and lifting people did not resonate. She would have done much better by just promising to bring prices down even if that's not one she can follow through on. Hindsight is 20/20, unfortunately.",
         "Yeah, when just milk, eggs, bread, and butter can run me over 40 bucks in Washington, that\u2019s crazy. I *do* buy for specific dietary needs  because I have gastroparesis so I guess I\u2019m forced to spend more\u2026",

         "I don't quite understand your point. Hillary and Obama were bitter rivals and whose staffs hated one another. Their respective constituencies were well polarized between the old guard and the new. Hillary's endorsement was invaluable to Obama in rallying the party around him, and that was partially why he rewarded her with Sec State.",
         "Heads need to roll. That starts with us not donating our money until they prove they know how to spend it.",
         "Yeah, I agree tariffs are bad policy, which is why I was bewildered by Joe Biden's tariffs getting so much positive press coverage after 4 years of Trump's tariffs are terrible coverage.\n\nWhat you're describing isn't failed messaging, it's policy that didn't happen because the donors wouldn't allow for it.",
         "Seems like deporting our entire population of cheap farm labor will help not with food prices",

I've been watching the Democrats too.\n\nThe Democrats think if you have power, it has to be THEIR power or you aren't allowed to have it.\n\nMusk, conversely, has organized engineers to fix the worlds biggest problems.\n\nThere's no question which one is trustworthy.  Musk says things that are often jocular and juvenile, still, to this day, because he doesn't moderate himself.  I haven't seen a statement out of an establishment democrat in ages that didn't reek of doublespeak.  The lies though, the easily verifiable lies about Donald Trump are really special, and the fact you still somehow think it's some kind of propaganda bullshit when it's so easily verifiable and obvious, just speaks loads as to why this happened.\n\nBut hey, keep misquoting Donald Trump, you'll get upvoted by the petty propaganda hacks that frequent any politically themed space on Reddit, maybe it'll make you feel good about yourself for a while, before you remember the Democrats overwhelmingly lost because the public doesn't agree with you.",
         "His point is it doesn\u2019t matter that he was late to endorsing her. So you can either realize that he learned to endorse candidates quicker as he did with Biden in 2020, or still squabble over small details that would have not led Clinton to victory anyways.",
         "> by Joe Biden's tariffs getting so much positive press coverage\n\nDifference being he didn't bloviate about trade wars being easy to win.\n\n>because the donors wouldn't allow for it.\n\nWouldn't allow for what? The president simply does not have the power to force businesses to lower prices.",
         "Nope, I\u2019ve been trying to explain that to republican voters too, that deportations of local agriculture workers paired with heavy tariffs on imported food is only going to hurt grocery prices. Try explaining this to Yakima valley folks. I sense a similar air to the Brexit debacle\u2026 these people are biting the hands that feed them",

Tons of people aren\u2019t on Reddit.  They get their information off of either the news and/or social media.  The latter is misinforming the living fuck out of people and it\u2019s having a ripple effect impacting all kinds of shit, not even just politics.  The news does this too, the extent depends on which news sources they watch specifically.\n\nBack to the topic of social media and people being terribly misinformed, (this is all anecdotal btw) I know some people in high up government positions who are seeing colleagues who should know better consuming all kinds of bullshit.  My friends have told me they\u2019re greatly concerned about the future of this country if this continues and it will.

Some instances were people with conditions like diabetes where they eventually put themselves in dangerous situations or even got themselves killed!  My PT\u2019s were saying that while people have shown this behavior before, they have never seen it get this bad until recent years.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s people working in schools dealing with kids who are spewing nonsense as fact consuming tik tok\u2019s or whatever it is they watch.  There\u2019s stories like this everywhere and it\u2019s only getting worse.  I\u2019ve heard it from friends who are working in the education system, and there\u2019s tons of discussions about this online.\n\nThis problem is pretty fucking massive and the trolls and those who wish to push this BS are outnumbering those who aren\u2019t for this.  And I imagine there\u2019s a lot of people like myself who gave up on social media platforms like Facebook which probably helped feed into the problem in the end as the number of bullshitters stays strong while those would try to oppose them have dwindled cause they\u2019ve given up.\u2019",

         "As a person who heads a quality dept in FDA-regulated industries, it\u2019s up to me and others in similar roles to hold the line to protect consumer safety.  It\u2019s not much, but it\u2019s what I can do. \n\nFor those that care, organic, Kosher, and Halal certifiers are not going to be affected as quickly as FDA. There is still oversight from those certifying bodies. There is additional layer of protection for those certified products.  \n\nBe safe out there, yall.\n\nETA a comment i posted as a reply but may help others:\n\nSo for Organic, Halal, and Kosher, to get the mark you have to comply with a set of standards that mirror the GMPs (Code of Federal regulations applicable to each industry). They require documentation, traceability of ingredients, and due to the requirement for manufacturers of ingredients to also be certified (organic specifically), site visits are also performed.\n\nFor organic, for example, once a year they audit our facilities and look at cleanliness and associated records. Making sure we have a recall plan, a food safety plan, that we are getting certificates of food safe conformity for packaging materials. They have to know WHO we are buying from, and they have to know that THAT vendor is being visited annually.\n\nAnd that\u2019s just organic. With Kosher it\u2019s the same deal, plus monthly random inspections. So a kosher organic product has 2 groups making sure I don\u2019t use sawdust as a food filler.\n\nDespite paying the certifier a fee, they are not easily swayed. Their reputation is on the line as a certifying body, so looking the other way on a requirement can be business suicide.\n\nYou know how often fda inspects food, cosmetic, or supplement facilities? Not annually, that\u2019s for sure. They rely on USDA to do the heavy lifting and are only CFR-required to routinely visit supplement manufacturers.\n\nThis is a brief rundown, let me know if you\u2019ve got questions.

         "Welcome back to the bad old days of 1905 when you're just as likely to die from a a simple bacterial infectionan as from poison in the food that you bought from your local store.\n\nBefore the establishment of the FDA in 1906, the food supply in the United States was largely unregulated, leading to widespread unsafe practices and contamination. Key issues included:\n\n1. Contaminants and Adulteration: Food producers often added harmful substances to increase weight, improve color, or extend shelf life. Common examples included adding lead-based dyes to candy, formaldehyde to milk, and borax as a preservative in meat. These chemicals were often toxic and had severe health effects on consumers.\n\n\n2. Spoilage and Lack of Sanitation: Without federal oversight, food production often lacked sanitary standards. Meatpacking plants, for example, were notoriously unhygienic, as famously described in Upton Sinclair\u2019s 1906 novel The Jungle. Food would often be contaminated with dirt, animal waste, and diseased meat, increasing the risk of illnesses.\n\n\n3. Mislabeling and Fraud: Many food products were mislabeled or falsely marketed. Companies made exaggerated or entirely false claims about their products, which misled consumers. Some products labeled as \u201cpure\u201d or \u201cnatural\u201d were anything but, and harmful additives were rarely disclosed.\n\n\n4. Milk and Meat Safety: Milk was often diluted with water and contaminated with bacteria due to improper handling and storage. Similarly, meat products were sometimes sourced from sick or diseased animals, contributing to outbreaks of foodborne illnesses.\n\n\n5. Absence of Food Standards: There were no uniform standards or labeling requirements, so consumers had little way to know the quality or safety of the products they bought.\n\n\n\nThese dangerous practices led to a demand for regulation, culminating in the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906, which later evolved into the FDA. The Act established basic standards, banned certain harmful additives, and introduced labeling requirements to protect public health and trust in the food supply.",

His voters aren't going to be swayed by a policy paper. They are voting for a personality.\n\nThat was first hit home for me back in 2016 when acquaintances of mine who were pro-Bernie switched to Trump after Clinton edged him out.

The Democrats had plenty of evidence, both contemporary and historical, that people did better under a Democratic administration.  Simplify that message and hammer home!  Paint the Republicans with a big black brush as the lying, cheating, stealing cons they are.  Paint the Democratic candidate as the one to put money into the wallet of ordinary folks.  That\u2019s it!  All the other issues, abortion, foreign policy, the environment.  They don\u2019t really sell, and the people who are concerned about those issues don\u2019t need additional messaging about them.  They are already on board.  I now wonder if some of the Democratic elite are not secretly working for the other side, that\u2019s how bad they are at doing this.  And let\u2019s not forget the mis- and dis- information from hostile players like Russia, Iran, China and N. Korea.  On top of the shitty shenanigans of guys like Elon Musk and others.  Couple this with the repressive efforts of some Republican state governments, and this is the outcome.  I hope the Democrats clean house and there is a purge of most of the upper infrastructure.

She wasn't even popular among progressive democrats.\n\n\\-------------\n\nOf course...the REAL mistake here belongs to the Clinton cronies in the DNC, who persuaded Biden NOT to run in 2016 against Trump, because it was Clintons turn.\n\nI think Biden would have won. Biden remains the only person to have beaten Trump, and he got more votes than any other president in our history.\n\nIf Biden had run in 2016, his 2nd term would have been 2020.

No concerns here whatsoever! They lied to us and gaslit us right up until Biden blew himself up on a debate stage in front of the whole world and their lies could no longer convince anyone. But by then it was almost too late.\n\nSo then the media pivoted to telling us how amazing and popular Kamala was and how quickly she was uniting the entire democratic coalition and how her campaign was just so full of joy joy joy.\n\nThen she pulls in , what, 20 million fewer votes than Biden in 2020?\n\n\\-----------\n\nThe lesson here is that the DNC and the media are constantly lying to democratic voters and can't be trusted. the DNC seems to go out of its way to prevent the candidates that people are most excited about from winning.

Pro-system politics is the bipartisan consensus of establishment Democrats and Republicans: it\u2019s the politics of NATO and other military alliances, of trade agreements, and of deference to economists (as when they say that price gouging isn\u2019t the cause of inflation). Trump stands for no fixed ideology, but rather a general thumbing of the nose at this consensus. The main fact of American politics in the post-Obama era is that an ever larger majority of Americans are angry at the status quo and open to anti-system politics.*\n\nYes.  This is what the MAGA-sphere has been saying since Bernie was thrown under the bus.  \n\nThe 1990's-2000's uniparty that was created by Bill Clinton COULD NOT ENDURE.

The *strongest* candidates were the ones who had the most brutal fights in the primary. This is true on the other side as well - the 2016 primary was *brutal* for Republicans. I think a lot of people have forgotten how bad it was. They pulled out *all* the stops to prevent Trump, including overriding an entire state's votes to take a victory away from Trump. It didn't work, and Trump was all the stronger for it. Democrats, on the other hand, did their best to push Hillary through to her throne, despite her obvious flaws. And it tanked her in the general.\n\nThere's only one objective reading of this situation. Primary elections are a *good* thing, not a bad thing. Voters feel better about candidates when they've had a chance to hold those candidates accountable for their own history, even if the person who ends up winning is not the candidate they preferred.

Harris lost 14 million from Biden's 15 million gain on Clinton. \n\nIt's not hard to see 14 million didn't care about the criminal charges.",

COVID-19 pandemic + the economy + referendum on Trump\u2019s handling of the pandemic + increased availability of mail in ballots and more early voting sites.\u00a0 Nonetheless, I think turnout this election will only be a bit subdued compared to the 2020 election.\u00a0",

I am not a conspiracy type but this is super weird.

         "After 2020, seeing how long it takes for votes to actually be counted, conceding kind of bothers me. I never thought about it before that's just what we did. But a winner is only predicted on election night, by news networks. It's not the official results and nobody should be forced to concede until they're ready. Or at all. Making a phone call congratulating your opponent is polite but should not be required. Democrats are always having to take the high road and it's exhausting. \n\nI only just learned that in 2000 Fox called Florida prematurely which kind of shaped the outcome of the election. Gore conceded, then retracted it, but the narrative was out that Bush had won, and a recount would have been taking the presidency away from him, rather than just... waiting to count the votes and certify the results.",

No one else has really been able to take control of his base. DeSantis failed on the national front (though he did make gains in Florida yesterday), Haley is a nonstarter for the base, and Vance feels like too much of a phony even for them.

Trump has called every election rigged and has made it so that democrats must insist that everything was fair so as to not fuel conspiracy theories. That's fucked.

They will try to pass some crazy shit and the Dems will keep filibustering which increases the needed majority to be 60% to pass which in the Senate the Magas do not have.

That\u2019s why I say democrats need to abandon neo-liberalism IF we\u2019re ever to move forward. It\u2019s a dead message, and a dead ideology as far as we should be concerned.

Granted the pandemic and corporate greed keeping prices high after the fact are to blame, but Biden was in power, people pinned him with the blame, and they decided to run the person most associated with him who was possibly the least popular 2020 primary candidate. \n\nI voted for her but they played this as if they were at the 3 yd line down by 2 points with a couple seconds left, and decided to unsuccessfully go for a touchdown instead of safely kicking a field goal for the win.

What does that look like to you?\n\nHe has said he will raise tariffs and lowering top corporate tax breaks from 35% to 21%. All of this has been proved by expert economists to fail. This WILL not work! Trump has proven, during COVID, to be someone who ignores expert-given advice. \n\nI get the hate towards the democratic ran economy, but Trumps PLAN is one that is likely to FAIL. Kamala\u2019s was expertly proven to BOOST the economy. Why not vote the candidate that has a plan statistically proven to fix the problem? Because the people before her failed? Why does SHE get to be the one penalized for her predecessors past failures? \n\nTrust is earned, not given. It is difficult for many to trust someone who has proven to be unreliable. A key indicator of whether or not someone will be reliable is if they have PLANS for a future.\n\nBut maybe I\u2019m missing something, did Trump say he has plans to \u201cburn it all down?\u201d"

Their mission is to overcome the largely Satanically-controlled world via corporate prayer, political action, and very possibly become a supernatural army along with angels to sweep away all things demonic, and emerge as the ruling body in the U.S and the world.\n\n\nIn recent years, this variable movement has become overtly political, epitomized by the \u201cSeven Mountain Mandate.\u201d This is the idea that Christians\u2014of the right sort\u2014are supposed to take dominion over society by conquering \u201cthe seven mountains\u201d of influence, or culture: government, religion, the family, education, arts and entertainment, business and the media\n\n\nhttps://www.christiancentury.org/article/features/quiet-rise-christian-dominionism\u00a0\nThe central tenet of Rushdoony\u2019s teaching is that God has tasked Christians with taking dominion over society, beginning in Genesis 1:28, in which God commands humans to take dominion over the earth.\u00a0 What would the perfectly reconstructed society look like? Rushdoony taught that it would provide man\u2014specifically the male gender\u2014with the greatest possible freedom, due to the absence of a government that currently limits that freedom. A federal government would no longer be responsible for laws that govern public safety, social programs (including public schools and welfare), or just about anything else.\n\n\nInstead, society would be reconstructed so that the male-headed family and local church fulfill the roles that currently belong to the government, which would have the authority only to protect private property and punish capital offenses. Families and churches, as the cornerstones of the reconstructed society, would implement Mosaic law, with Christ as king over what would have become a Christian nation. Without government welfare, churches would carry the responsibility of aid to the poor, and without public schools, families would be responsible for their own children\u2019s education. The economy would operate without any government regulation, meaning present laws requiring the integrity of consumer goods, protecting workers\u2019 rights, and disallowing exploitative financial practices would no longer be in effect. Because in a reconstructed America Christians would have brought God\u2019s kingdom to earth through the implementation of Mosaic law, these protections would not be necessary.",

With the effects of a worldwide pandemic, there was a global recession and as you mentioned, people all over the world were struggling.\n\nIf Trump was re-elected in 2020, people would likely still have struggled and not been any better. I agree that democrats do need to get rid of the elitism and listen to what people actually care about and address that, but do think that Trump is that vastly better at ensuring a strong economy, I\u2019m not so sure.\n\nI mean currently in the US unemployment rates are at a 20-year low and prices for some things like gas are coming down. I think when it comes to the economy people don\u2019t realize it takes time to \u201cfix it.\u201d I think Trump likely benefitted from policies put in place before him in which we had a strong economy.\n\nThen with the pandemic + more spending to address people\u2019s need creating a larger deficit, we didn\u2019t feel the full effects until AFTER (when Biden was in office). I think more people should realize that nothing is fixed overnight, so when it comes to economy it may take years to reap benefits from actions taken by government to address these issues.\n\nBut I hear what you\u2019re saying. My concern is throwing out all the things Trump has done (striking down Roe v Wade, colluding with Russia, organizing a coup to overturn the last election, talk about shooting guns at media and political rivals, racist/sexist comments , \u00a0etc etc) and considering the global ramifications of his election to presidency \u00a0( unchecked power for him to continue passing legislation that would benefit him/avoid further prosecution for his convicted felonies, Ukraine losing war/Russia invading into other countries, worsening in Gaza ), IGNORING \u00a0all this to vote him back in!

Personally, based on his track record, I\u2019d argue that the economy would\u2019ve fared better than it did under Biden, but none of us have a crystal ball and there were so many other factors at play.\n\nNo candidate is perfect, and I also take issue with some of DT\u2019s comments over the years. But I do believe that he has America\u2019s best interest at heart, and he seems to have respect for my country (Australia) as well. \n\nI appreciate that he didn\u2019t start any new wars during his first term, and that he is adamant about resolving the devastating conflicts that erupted during Biden\u2019s presidency. \n\nIt\u2019s not hyperbolic to say that we are uncomfortably close to a global conflict, and the Biden administration did nothing to mediate this. \n\nNo innocent person deserves to be killed and these conflicts need to be resolved. Too many children and other innocent people are dying because of the actions of extremist, power-hungry adults.\n\nI will say, it\u2019s also suspicious how much money the Biden administration has funnelled to Ukraine, only for there to be no significant progress in their fight against Russia. \n\nAs for Roe V. Wade, I personally believe making abortion a state-by-state issue is the right thing to do. It\u2019s a highly contentious, sensitive issue and if people do not want to live in a state where abortion is allowed (and potentially funded via their tax dollars), I believe that\u2019s their right.\n\nObviously, your government runs a little differently compared to ours, but I can see many parallels between our two nations and the struggles we\u2019re facing. \n\nI think it\u2019s important for all of us to remember that most people are fairly decent and want the best for their country. It\u2019s going to take a lot of work to bring both of our countries back from the states they\u2019ve found themselves in.\n\nPeople need to be having more civil, open conversations (like we\u2019re having here), rather than fighting and hurling insults. We may not agree on everything, but you and I are both on the same page in that we want the best for our countries and the people in them. That\u2019s what matters.",

Kamala's best demo (none were good compared to Biden) outside of African American women was white men and women. Exit polling shows the economy, international relations, and immigration were the biggest issues independent and swing voters had. You can scream about race and sexism all you want but the data shows voters (especially independent voters) did not like the democratic platform for ANY of those issues (in case you forgot, Biden, a white male, was getting pummeled in the polls before he stepped down; Newsome, a white male, wasn't polling any better than kamala). \n\nA complete overhaul is needed if the dems hope to make any headway in the future. And calling the other side racist and castigating fellow decent humans who despite strongly disliking trump (large majority), and strongly being pro abortion (even larger majority), voted for him because they disliked your platform THAT MUCH, isn't going to do anything but turnoff swing voters to your cause.",

Campaigning with the Cheney's was already a pill to swallow. She tried to convince Republicans and Trump voters to vote for her instead of pandering to her own base. \n\nThat's why the DNC failed. Trump didn't gain votes. Democrats lost them all.",

In 75 days (or w/e) it will mean nothing while Trump will be president.\n\nThe reason the democrats are an ugly choice, the reason Harris was an ugly choice, is because to reach the point we're at now required the democrats to be more comfortable with the possibility of a Trump-like figure than with taking a risk. \n\nHarris said \"we're not going back\" and offered up Dick fucking Cheney. Her campaign embodied a return to the bullshit that brought us to Trump instead of offering a new alternative. My anger at the democrats have nothing to do with Kamala being a woman, or a POC, and everything to with that they had 4 years to deal with Trump and it all came down to a slapdash two month campaign at the end.

Open discourse listening to each side is what we should do more.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0I personally don\u2019t think the economy would have been any better under DT in 2020 but again, who knows. I appreciate he didn\u2019t start any wars but we shouldn\u2019t congratulate him for that, that would\u2019ve been worse at putting US in debt and getting us out of the hole after COVID. And abortion is a health issue, not a state issue. All women should have access to this and decisions regarding their health be made between them and their doctor. It\u2019s not so easy to pick up everything and move to a different state that likely has a different \u00a0cost of living and a different community (meaning away from families/friends/other loved ones).\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Even though Ukraine is making little progress, I think them being able to hold off this far against Russia which has far mar resources and a more sophisticated military, to me that\u2019s impressive. With DT, it\u2019s a high possibility aid to Ukraine will be cut off or significantly cut back and that Ukraine would definitely be defeated.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0I hope that most people are fairly decent but DT does say many inflammatory and vile things that are hard for decent people to ignore. I do not think he has the country\u2019s best interests in mind but puts his own interests above others. I do think it\u2019s possible for him to do some good things, like providing tax cuts to some but ultimately that will likely widen the wage gap between the super wealthy and middle class/poor.\u00a0",

I really did.\n\nThe vibes felt real with reports of how many women were voting early, and how many seemed energized to back Democrats and Kamala Harris after the reversal of Roe v. Wade and reproductive rights in a number of states.\n\nThis was supposed to be the year that women \u2014\u00a0[who for decades have voted at higher rates than men in presidential elections](https://cawp.rutgers.edu/facts/voters/gender-differences-voter-turnout#GGN)\u00a0\u2014 could help break the ultimate glass ceiling by propelling a woman into the White House.\n\nNope, I was wrong.\n\nHarris needed white women to secure a victory, and while she won the women\u2019s vote overall, more than half of white women backed Trump, compared to 45 percent for Harris,\u00a0[according to a CNN exit poll.](https://www.cnn.com/election/2024/exit-polls/national-results/general/president/0)\u00a0That\u2019s consistent with Trump\u2019s performance among white women voters in 2020 in the match-up against Joe Biden, and in\u00a0[2016 election](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2018/08/09/an-examination-of-the-2016-electorate-based-on-validated-voters/)\u00a0when more white women voted for Trump than for\u00a0Hillary Clinton.\n\nI don\u2019t get it. Familiarity is supposed to breed contempt. Instead, voters are OK with returning to power a convicted felon who\u2019s threatening to turn our 248-year-old democracy into an autocracy. A race that pollsters pegged as a tossup in battleground states\u00a0[went decisively his way on Tuesday night.](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/11/05/metro/election-2024-live-updates/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link)\n\nNot only did Trump capture the Electoral College, but he is leading in the national popular vote, which if it holds would make him the first Republican to win it since George W. Bush in 2004.\n\nThe Democrats bet big that abortion would get women and their allies out in droves, but it wasn\u2019t enough to counteract the enduring appeal of Trump\u2019s strong-man politics and resentment over high prices at the grocery store.\n\nConsider what happened in Arizona, Nevada, Missouri, and Montana, all states that had\u00a0[abortion measures](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/06/g-s1-32962/abortion-rights-amendments-2024-election)\u00a0on the ballot. In all four, voters backed abortion access\u00a0*and*\u00a0elected to send Trump back to\u00a0the White House.\n\nThe issues top of mind for voters,\u00a0[according to the CNN exit poll,](https://www.cnn.com/election/2024/exit-polls/national-results/general/president/0)\u00a0were the state of democracy, followed by the economy, and then abortion and immigration. That means ideology and inflation shaped how people cast their ballots, more so than reproductive rights.\n\nPerhaps the biggest takeaway for presidential candidates: inflation is political kryptonite.\n\nI thought the abortion debate would drive a massive gender gap \u2014 not really. Harris didn\u2019t run up the score with women compared to Biden in 2020,\u00a0[according to preliminary analysis by the AP.](https://apnews.com/article/ap-votecast-trump-harris-election-president-voters-86225516e8424431ab1d19e57a74f198)\n\nMeanwhile,\u00a0Trump\u2019s strategy of going after bros seemed born\u00a0out of desperation. He made a last-minute pitch to young men at a virtual rally on Tuesday when he\u00a0[reportedly\u00a0](https://x.com/KFILE/status/1853924123396980999)said: \u201cI would very much appreciate if you would get out and vote, get off that beautiful couch or wherever you might be sitting right now and just go out and vote.\u201d\n\nBut\u00a0Trump\u2019s message seems to have resonated\u00a0[with men 18 to 44](https://apnews.com/article/ap-votecast-trump-harris-election-president-voters-86225516e8424431ab1d19e57a74f198)\u00a0who voted for him in greater numbers than in 2020, according to the AP.\n\nAnd if you thought Trump would merely hold onto his traditional base, think again.\u00a0[As my colleague James Pindell points out](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/11/06/newsletters/starting-point/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link), Trump not only found success in white, rural areas but performed better with Black and Latino voters of any Republican in recent history.\n\nIt will take some time to unpack how Trump scored a decisive victory in a nation that is so deeply divided. Left unremarked: the sexism and racism that pervade this country that would sooner elect a convicted felon than elevate a female vice president to the Oval Office.",

         "Let's be clear, women did vote for Harris. But white women, specifically, have never voted for the Democrat, except in 1964 and 1968. And today, many think that white women have [Stockholm Syndrome](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2024/11/07/harris-trump-white-women-voter-demographics-2024/76089457007/). \n\nI don't know about that. Whatever the case, the DNC butchered and squandered this opportunity. And the results were statistically epic.\n\n* Youth. Harris had a 6 percentage point advantage. Hillary had 18, Biden 25. Young people shifted to Trump.\n\n* Young women. Harris won then by 12 points, Biden won them by 24, twice the gap in 2020 vs. 2024.\n\n* Women in general. Trump won 42% of the women's vote in 2016, then 43% in 2020, increasing it again to 45% in 2024.\n\n* White women. They have only voted for the Democrat twice, in 1964 for Johnson and 1996 for Bill Clinton. Trump captured 52% of their vote. (Higher than that for older white women.)\n\n* White men. Trump won white men by 20 points, which is massive. However, he won white men by 24 points in 2020, so he lost some white male support. \n\n* Black men. Harris won 80% of Black men, when this whole election we were told black men wouldn't vote for her, and that they were [intellectually deficient](https://x.com/kbyrd2_/status/1853883382998204681?s=46) because of that.\n\n* Black women. Harris won 93% of their vote.\n\n* Trump has (somehow) diversified the GOP in ways the Democrats took for granted. The Harris vote was much less diverse (by half) than the Biden vote in 2020.\n\n* Hispanic women. Clinton won them by 44 points, Harris won them by 24 points. That's a massive shift of 20 points. \n\n* Hispanic men. In 2016, Clinton won Latino men by 31 points. In 2020, Biden won them by 23 points. In 2024, Trump won then by 10 points. That's a shift of 41 and 33 points. That's not just a slice of voters, that's a wholesale reversal. \n\nThe DNC basically horribly misjudged this electorate. The Republican Party has had competitive primaries in 1996, 2000, 2008, 2012, and 2016. The Democratic Party hasn't had a competitive primary since 2008. The Democratic Party thinks it's a majority party, but it's not. America is high school. The Democrats are the theater kids, the AV club, the chess team, debate team, the kids taking AP classes, Tracy Flick and Mark Ratner. The Republican (voters) are the kids taking regular classes, playing sports, fixing cars, having keggers, Stacy and Brad Hamilton. The \"regular kids\" aren't going to follow the theater kids, unless someone comes along with super charisma like Bill Clinton or Obama. *And* speaks about the economy. \n\n> The Harris campaign tried, with good reason, to convince white women that their future was at stake. Trump is all but guaranteed to oversee a further rollback in reproductive rights, and the president-elect has also openly flirted with a federal ban on abortion. \n\n>And yet that was not a winning message for white women, at 52%. A recent Times/Siena showed that the majority of white women, like their white male counterparts, saw inflation and the economy as their top voting issue. Abortion was second, and immigration was third. To be sure, there is a notable age split here: Gen Z women only went 36 percent for Trump, women aged 30 to 44 went 41 percent for Trump, women aged 45 to 64 went 48 percent for Trump, and women over 65 backed the former president 45 percent.",

         "Yup first reason is Harris is a woman. I am sorry to say in case you haven't noticed a woman sometimes is a woman's enemy. Men will normally stick together. \n\nTwo is economy. Many people are struggling.. all things are getting expensive.. groceries, child care, housing etc. But people forget to turn around the Covid-hit economy is going to take time. It happened during Trump 1.0. Businesses were hit hard, jobs evaporated. With demand collapsing the entire supply chain also went down. Trump paid the price but so did Biden/Harris. The Feds threw down the interest rate to stimulate the economy. The government gave aid to the private sector. Sectors that benefited from Covid lockdown such as food delivery, entertainment like Netflix and K-pop, online shopping, Zoom etc. As the government finally started to control Covid, people could venture outside to buy things. Groceries.. as the supply chain had collapsed.. demand far outstripped supply.. prices skyrocketed. People were furious not at the supermarket chain like Walmart, Kroger and Costco but the government. Have you seen their profits? Kroger reported $736 million in Q4 2033 profits with annual profits of 2.1 billion. Walmart gross profit for 2024 was $157 billion an increase from gross profit $147 billion in 2023. Inflation rate at 2022 was 8%\n\nJobs. The unemployment rate in April 2020 was 14.8% the highest ever since data collected in 1948. 20 million jobs lost. Leisure and hospitality. Restaurants. Latest unemployment rate is 4.1% for October 2024. A vast improvement but many people are still mad with their workplace. Americans will know how stressful it is. Can't take it out on the bosses. Who is the punching bag for the employed as well the unemployed? \n\nInflation rate 2.4% in October 2024. But do people gave credit to Biden/Harris? No..they remember the high rate. Is the job of whom to control inflation? Federal Reserve. Of course it is more than that. The Fed conducts monetary policy to promote maximum employment, stable prices and moderate long-term interest rate. It is independent from the government though subject to congressional oversight.",

         "A lot of the long term failures stem from white supremacy and the overall relationship with race in the U.S.. The U.S. is one of a handful of countries that was built with colonial concepts like race and slavery based on race at its foundation and it\u2019s one of few countries that relied so heavily on these concepts and built its social core on these concepts. Most of the halt to progress over the last two centuries boils down to people wanting to make sure power stays in certain groups and not wanting things to change in a way that is more diverse. It\u2019s essentially been the driving thorn that has reared its head repeatedly since the Civil War. There\u2019s so much of what we consider normal that was once controversial and usually it was the perceived threat to whiteness that made it controversial. \n\nIt\u2019s time to get real about this conversation. Race isn\u2019t even a real concept but it\u2019s been the bane of this country for a long time. Most people don\u2019t understand what \u201cwhiteness\u201d and race really is and think it\u2019s just some skin color classification. The concept of \u201cwhiteness\u201d and race by skin color originate as functional parts of colonialism and slavery. The world didn\u2019t classify itself like this until colonialism which means that it was the colonizing countries that brought these concepts to the world in order to help their systems function. \u201cWhiteness\u201d isn\u2019t just skin color and it\u2019s not just a particular group of people. It\u2019s also a social system originally intended to ensure the max benefits of the colonies goes to the descend of colonizing countries and to justify darker actions taken during this time. In its origin, it functioned as a way to establish those deemed superior within colonial systems and became the upheld ideal in many colonies and post colonial nations. \n\nNone of it is real btw but our belief in race and its relationship to the formation of the country and the relationship of \u201cwhiteness\u201d to all of that has been the biggest burden to progress that our country has and continues to face.",

         "https://www.texastribune.org/2022/08/25/texas-trigger-law-abortion/\n\nSo, because of this law, doctors only get to perform abortions if they are life saving. If their perform the procedure and decision is challenged, they face jail time. But if they refuse and their decision is challenged, they can only be charged with a medical malpractice. They are taking on far greater legal risk if they choose to perform the procedure, and little risk if they let the patient die. \n\nWould you want to risk needing a life saving abortion under this law?",
         "Texas SB 8 specifies \"banning all abortion from conception except when the mother's life was in immediate danger.\"\n\nThere are a couple of problems with this. One, because doctors now have to make a legal decision when someone's life is potentially in danger rather than going with their best judgement and relying on expertise, it is leading to an increase in maternal deaths as a result of doctors second guessing themselves and worrying about potential legal repercussions rather than their patients lives. Medical malpractice is quite a different story from first degree murder, which is the difference between now and then. If a doctor made a mistake before, they were charged with malpractice and have insurance to help cover the costs of that. The same can not be said about first degree murder, which is now a very real concern for these doctors if they make a mistake or err in judgment.\n\nSecondly, this has led to a number of cases where a delivery/baby is totally unviable but still has a heartbeat and thus cannot be aborted. One such example is in [this](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/womens-health/texas-abortion-ban-deaths-pregnant-women-sb8-analysis-rcna171631) news story, where a woman's baby had a rare disorder that caused fragile bones. The baby was likely going to break bones and suffocate during birth, but because it still had a heartbeat in utero, it could not be aborted and she would have been forced to carry it to term, putting the woman's life in danger for no real reason.",

I would ask you consider reading the second example describing **Kate Cox's** situation; she had a pregnancy she was excited about, got legal clearance, and in response the AG of Texas warned doctors that her exemption to the law didn't shield or exempt *them* for providing the abortion that the courts ruled *she* could get.\n\n***Josseli Barnica:***\n\n[Josseli Barnica Died in Texas After Waiting 40 Hours for Miscarriage Care](https://www.propublica.org/article/josseli-barnica-death-miscarriage-texas-abortion-ban)\n\n*Barnica is one of at least two Texas women who ProPublica found lost their lives after doctors delayed treating miscarriages, which fall into a gray area under the state\u2019s strict abortion laws that prohibit doctors from ending the heartbeat of a fetus.*\n\n*Neither had wanted an abortion, but that didn\u2019t matter.

Its contents, which include a broad expansion of executive powers; a de facto national abortion ban, increased restrictions on contraception; brutal policies against undocumented migrants; and the elimination of several federal agencies (including the Department of Education), didn\u2019t sit well with prospective voters.\n\nTrump feigned ignorance of the plan, despite his close ties to those involved in crafting it, while Democrats did all they could to warn about the conservative blueprint for a second Trump term.\n\nSure enough, less than 24 hours after the election was called for Trump, his allies, advisers, and prominent supporters were celebrating the now-open road to Project 2025\u2019s implementation. \n\nOn Wednesday, former Trump adviser Steve Bannon \u2014 who just weeks ago completed a four-month prison sentence on a contempt of Congress conviction \u2014- lauded Christian Nationalist Matt Walsh, a commentator at The Daily Wire, on his War Room broadcast. \n\nWalsh had written on X, formerly Twitter: \u201cNow that the election is over I think we can finally say that yeah actually Project 2025 is the agenda. Lol\u201d \n\n\u201cMatt Walsh, I think, is a very smart and funny guy,\u201d Bannon said. \u201cPut that everywhere,\u201d he added, with instructions to his staff to promote the post on his social media.\n\nRight-wing podcast Benny Johnson also gloated about the project. \u201cIt is my honor to inform you all that Project 2025 was real the whole time,\u201d he wrote. \n\n\tIn a separate post, Tarrant County GOP Chair Bo French wrote, \u201cSo can we admit now that we are going to implement Project 2025?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\tRegardless of whether Trump explicitly endorses Project 2025 as a guide for his second administration, the overlap in its proposals, staff, and goals means the two are inextricably linked.\u00a0 Republicans just don\u2019t have to pretend anymore.",

         "The issue for conservative men is that socially conservative women tend to expect certain things from their mates, like the ability to provide. There being fewer conservative women than men, they can be picky about who they choose. Many conservative men just aren\u2019t good looking enough or wealthy enough or socially adept enough to get the hot conservative brides they want. Those gals don\u2019t have to settle for scrubs and so they don\u2019t. \n\nThere are also a fair number of conservative career women who just aren\u2019t on the market. They\u2019re secretly gay or asexual or just don\u2019t buy what their movement is selling for women\u2019s roles.

Or even just a fuck before discovering they are incompatible. Now moderate and liberal women have grown self respect and are actively avoiding them and for good reason. \n\nSo- you have a demand supply imbalance. More conservative men looking for companionship and sex and fewer women who are willing to deal with them. The men aren\u2019t willing to improve themselves in any way or reduce their entitlement, so they want the government to basically force women to be so desperate they have no other choice to marry these rejects.
