There were a few red pockets that didn't surprise me.  The vast majority of Staten Island went for Trump, which wasn't surprising because Staten Island has been a Republican stronghold for decades, for some convoluted set of reasons.  \n\nAnother unsurprisingly red chunk of the map was a neighborhood called Breezy Point, at the far western end of the Rockaway peninsula.  That neighborhood is literally a gated community on a private beach.  In NYC.  It's clearly the kind of absolutely insane wealth where people's main concern is \"When I die, I need to leave my yachts to my children, without them having to pay taxes on it.\"  So, no surprise there either.\n\nThere were however 2 other little red pockets within the city that made me scratch my head, and dig deeper to figure out \"What's going on there?\"\n\nOne pocket was Brighton Beach, just a little east of Coney Island.   I'd been Coney Island a handful of times.  I'd walked along the beach down to Brighton Beach from Coney Island.  That whole area always seemed like Mets-fan-working-class-NYC to me. It made no sense that Brighton Beach would be Republican.  But... I learned, that Brighton Beach is also known as \"Little Russia.\"  Not the explanation I was expecting to find, but certainly a clear explanation, of why that neighborhood would break for Trump.\n\nAnother red area that surprised me was a neighborhood called Middle Village, smack dab in the middle of Queens.  I had no experience with this area, and thusly didn't have any preconceived notions of how / why it would vote this way or that.  After a bit of googling though, I found out that back in the 70s and 80s, when NYC was genuinely a rough place... when Times Square was more like a red light district, than Disneyland... back when crime (both petty and violent) was genuinely out of control... The one safe neighborhood in the whole city was Middle Village.  Why?   Cause that's where all mafia top brass lived.  Every two-bit mugger and car thief and tweaked out addict knew not to fuck with anyone in that neighborhood, because the mob would find you, and respond 10-fold.\n\nSo... that's who voted for Trump in NYC, in 2016.   Russians, and the mob.  (And Staten Island and the insanely wealthy of Breezy Point).  The rest of the city knows him as the shitty grifter that he is.\n\nEdit: Some words and some grammar.",

To them, as long as it's clear that they, a white person, control the interaction and the Black person will do what they're told, the racist is generally cordial. \n\nTo your actual point, it depends on how closeted their racism is. Where I grew up, there was a lot of racism, but it mostly happened outside of actual interactions with Black people. They'd bitch and moan about the Black person to their own family and friends, but in public they were civil. Some wouldn't acknowledge a Black person existed until circumstances called for it. Some wouldn't shake a Black person's hand or make any physical contact with them. If they had Black neighbors, they'd either eventually decide that they're some of the *good ones* or blame them for everything that goes wrong with their house/neighborhood and call the police on them for any minor thing. \n\n*Most* ^([citation needed]) racists I know just want Black people to stay *over there* and to *know their place* but it's never backed up with anything besides whining at home or with their friends. \n\nSince Trump has made it more socially acceptable to be racist in public, there's been a lot more overt racist things, like refusing to move out of the way on the sidewalk, spitting behind their backs, and generally loudly voicing complaints about \"those people\" when Black people are around. \n\nI haven't seen a resurgence of burning crosses or throwing bricks through windows, but if Trump ends up as president, I'd expect those events to follow.",

Based on what I've seen and heard around me I wouldn't be surprised by a narrower victory similar to Clinton in 2016 or a +7 win for Harris like Biden had in 2020.

If there\u2019s so many of them worried about being able to vote for her without their husbands finding out it seems logical they they\u2019d also be more likely to lie about who they support in polls.

         "Sure, disfranchising and isolating the prisoners further from any possible interest in the outside world is definitely very helpful in rehabilitating them. And refusing to let them vote is here as a punishment, it is not needful for a prisoner in any case. Everybody seems to be giving different answers based not on any concrete benefit but on arbitrary reasons that are vaguely based on some vague idea that morality functions as an excuse to take any rights away from an individual that has broken laws. That seems a glib and lazy way to engage this question. Incarceration and any punishment should have some actual reasons behind it, rather than some feeling of not liking that they vote and since they are prisoners, you can take what you want, unlike in general from persons you do not like and don't want to vote. That side concern is irrelevant altogether, since arguing that a group should be disfranchised because they are easily influenced would be absurd in other contexts.\n\nLegal punishments should not depend on the likes or naive feelings of people, but actual good reasons to achieve something concrete, which is consistent on clearly formulated rights of the prisoners and what exactly the incarceration is supposed to achieve. Not on random likings or inertia about a thing that is just so.",

However, the people spreading this faith recognized that the one problem with such belief is that it\u2019s open to bad actors and corruption. \n\nTwo of the most important and impactful biblical stories - Adam and Eve, and the death of Jesus - both convey this message.

They do not listen to facts or reason.",
         "Three ideas about this:\n\n1. There's considerable overlap between communities of white working class people, conservative Christian communities, and Trump supporters. It kind of makes sense. In poorer and more rural areas, the church might be the most important institution around. They can provide social outlets, security, and charity. For decades, many have felt abandoned by Washington. They like Trump because he's speaking to them directly and appears to be fighting the fight on their behalf. They're convinced that building the wall will lead to more jobs. They feel left by behind by progressive policies that (they believe) will priviledge people of color and LGBTQ+ groups over themselves. If Trump is a little corrupt and gives tax cuts to the rich, they view this as a small price to pay. \n\n2. Trump's base have successfully convinced themselves (with the major help of several extremely conservative media outlets) that every attack on Trump is a witch hunt and that the Democrats are making up all of his crimes. Obviously, he's famously done some unchristian things that can't be covered up completely, but they can claim that the left is exaggerating and that he's God's imperfect vessel, etc, etc. \n\n3. The right has spent decades turning abortion into a major wedge issue and convincing conservative Christians that it's the most important thing in the world. Whatever Trump does wrong, they'll convince themselves that it was worth it to overturn Roe v Wade. And of course they want to go much further by blocking abortion access on a federal level now and they know it won't happen under Harris. \n\nI doubt very much that Trump's loss would change many opinions from his base. The GOP generally may be ready to abandon Trump as he'll clearly show that he has no path to victory after two election losses, and a major loss in the popular vote in 2016. But I suspect his base will continue to search for their next right wing hero for the foreseeable future.",
         "For starters, they will deny his loss because \u201ceveryone knows\u201d he would win if the elections were fair.  \n\nHis followers have been fed a steady diet of increasingly absurd lies, to the point where now he can point to empty seats and say, \u201cmy rallies are completely full!\u201d\u2026 and I think their brains see people in the seats.",
         "Fragility and insecurity are the foundations of patriarchal religions. They can only be validated if the masses just fall in line and agree with their beliefs, even if by force. \n\nTrump is fragile and insecure. Christian extremists know they can use him to force the people to validate them, including the non-believers.",

Just to be clear, I\u2019m not saying either of them are, I\u2019m an atheist, but if anyone is, then Trump ticks a lot of boxes. With Obama it was some stupid shit like his Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel\u2019s first name and letters of Obama\u2019s name adding up to 666 somehow. And the birther lie apparently also made him antichrist.\n\nTrump is acting like he\u2019s the second coming of Christ, destined by God to save America. He turns brother against brother, lies to no end and wear a sign of the beast on his forehead which he makes all his followers do as well.",

It would be hilarious if it wasn\u2019t a religion so widespread and so deeply ingrained into our country\u2019s culture. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I have no problem with people believing whatever they want to personally believe. The problem is when a person, whatever the cause, tries to impose their beliefs on others, and that\u2019s kind of the core of Christianity: force everyone to behave the way you think they should behave Or Else.",

They want these voters to stay simple-minded, so they can manipulate them. And it's worked. Look at the fool leading them with BS & jibberish. And they nod their heads and seem to often think violence is the way to win. It's crazy in our country. Unlike civilized, educated countries around the world. They push to educate their citizens.

Maybe that's unfair, it's difficult to counter the flood of constant, bizarre, hateful, manipulative bile.  \n\nBut the process is so drawn out, so ludicrous, so unnecessary.

Bad-faith actors are running amok in the absence of a  confident American presence, hamstrung by this ludicrous election process. \n\nThe World has, for a long time, extended a respect to the US as a moral and even military arbiter.

I don't think there's really much legal debate if it was vote-buying.\n\nTo clarify: Paying people to register to vote is also vote-buying.

To nitpick a few things:\n\n1) Saying she can\u2019t recall anything she would do differently from Joe Biden, a deeply unpopular incumbent. Not good, especially because you should see that question coming. \n\n2) Refusing to allow a Palestinian House member speak at the DNC was an unforced error. And then doubling down by sending Bill Clinton to MI to essentially lecture the Uncommitted movement about their top issue. Campaign botched this. \n\n3) Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania. I do wonder what this race looks like if Shapiro is on the ticket. If Harris loses PA, this is going to be the topic that never dies.\n\nAgain, this is picking nits. Debate performance was great. Her Fox News interview is the best political performance I\u2019ve seen since Barack Obama\u2019s DNC speech in 2004. She has been charming and funny, but also forceful and tough. She. Has. Been. Brilliant.\n\nI desperately want Harris to win. Already voted for her. She and her staff deserve amazing plaudits for their work. They have exceeded expectations and they have done nearly everything right. A few minor missteps, but nothing compared to the torrent of bullshit from the opponent.",

Him stepping down meant she fulfilled the role of stepping up.\u00a0\n\n\nHonestly before it was confirmed he was stepping aside, I think there were a lot of good democratic names that were floated that makes me think democrats actually have a decent lineup down the road. Gretchen Whitmer, Peter Buttigeg, AOC could easily be the next 12-24 years after Harris.

Sure, maybe it could be inferred that a party will pick one person or another before the convention, but sometimes it wasn\u2019t until a couple weeks out.

They can sane-wash the ramblings of Trump while playing small flubs from democrats on repeat, and vilify them in their opinion pieces, and there's nothing anyone can reasonably do against it.\n\nDominion and Smartmatic sued Fox News for defamation, and while the Smartmatic suit is ongoing, Fox News settled with Dominion out of court for almost 800 million dollars, and Tucker Carlson got fired in the process, so at least they've been proven not to be invincible.\n\nWithout Fox News as their primary source of (mis)information, conservative leaning people will no longer get a warped view of the world they live in. Fox News would be *required* to give them real news, and not hit pieces and opinion pieces masquerading as news stories. Buffoons like Jesse Waters and Sean Hannity should get reprimanded for misleading or outright false statements, and the network should be fined heavily for each deliberately false piece they air without proper fact checking.\n\nThe Fairness Doctrine that Reagan axed in the 80s (because of course it was Reagan, it's always Reagan), would ensure that Broadcast networks gave equal time to opposing viewpoints, but on the other hand, \"equal time\" is a bit of a double edged sword, because there is no point to have a NASA scientist and the local moon-landing-denier share equal air time simply because it is required. So I'm not sure the Fairness Doctrine is the right solution, but a new piece of legislation designed for more modern times would be a good idea to implement.\n\nApply it to all news networks equally, and you'll probably find that it will hit conservative leaning networks harder, because they simply don't fact check to the same degree as more liberal-leaning networks.\n\nSo yeah.

To claim otherwise is tinfoil-hatted at best, outright malicious most of the time.\n\nThe issue at hand is: It's bloody complicated to actually make happen - particularly when the leader in charge of one side is banking on the political opponent's return to power to get a blank cheque to escalate the crisis further while turning a blind eye to whatever violations happen in the future. \n\nAnd on the other side you have a terrorist organization backed by enemy nations, while one of them is actively conducting a war and trying to do what it can not only to interfere with the ongoing election and destabilize not just the US but the West as a whole, the other nation being led by religious zealots who will never acknowledge the right of the other side's people to even exist, period.\n\nI *wish* this utter shitshow was over, had never even escalated to this point, but this is *not* something that the USA can simply *decide* to end - it's a process that the current administration - alongside other big nations' leaders - has been pursuing for the past year and longer. A process which has been sabotaged time and again by new events and decisions outside of the administration's control taking place and exacerbating the situation time and again.\n\nWhich is to say: I firmly trust that Kamala Harris will do her utmost to bring this all-around humanitarian tragedy to an end. I do not believe she will sit idly by and let this shit continue. \n\nAnd hopefully, once she wins the presidency and gets into power, she will be able to put proper pressure on the ones responsible without it directly benefitting the other candidate who has made it abundantly clear that he would rather see Gaza razed to the ground with indiscriminate slaughter than actually strive for a stable, peaceful solution to an age-old conflict in the region.\n\nI know Kamala Harris will do her best to move things in the right direction. It might not be enough, who can say, but the effort will be genuine.\n \nI know that Donald Trump will do his worst to escalate things further and that he will never so much as attempt to genuinely care for human suffering, aside from his own grievances.",

The project was done on a cost plus basis, which means that Haliburton would profit no matter what at the expense of the taxpayer and one of [Haliburton\u2019s subsidiaries (Kellogg Brown and Root) didn\u2019t even provide quality products like what was expected.](https://youtu.be/IctIgY3QtNg?si=Jea32KOrLmty0xvG)\n\n>A cost-plus contract is an agreement where a buyer agrees to pay the actual costs of a project plus an additional fee to the contractor. Here\u2019s how it works:\n\n\t1.\tActual Costs: The buyer covers all the contractor\u2019s expenses needed to complete the project, like materials, labor, and equipment.\n\t2.\tPlus Fee: On top of these costs, the buyer also pays an extra amount, usually a percentage of the costs or a fixed fee, as the contractor\u2019s profit.\n\nSo, in a cost-plus contract, the contractor doesn\u2019t charge a fixed price up front. Instead, the buyer pays as the project progresses, based on real expenses plus a bit extra for the contractor\u2019s profit. This type of contract can be useful when project costs are uncertain or might change, giving flexibility to both parties.\n\nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/news/halliburton-whistleblower-on-exposing-7-billion-no-bid-defense-contract-2019-06-30/\n\nThere were NO new wars under Trump!

She had a chance during the DNC to allow a Palestinian-American to speak on their behalf with a pre-vetted speech that wasn\u2019t going to incite any inflammatory comments toward Israel, and they still didn\u2019t let that happen. Even with an entire Undecided delegation protesting outside feat. Ilhan Omar, they still didn\u2019t let that happen.\n\nBy all means, I would *hope* that more Arabs veer toward Kamala with this strategy, but considering how late in the game showing empathy towards the Gazan and Lebanese victims in her speech has come, I\u2019m going to assume that this is going to end up ringing hollow after a year\u2019s worth of genocide with no promise for a change in approach or rhetoric.",

I wonder how well a health ministry could count their dead if the people responsible aren\u2019t able to feed themselves.

So many innocent lives lost. Desperate, hungry people fleeing for safety, over and over again. The scale of suffering is heartbreaking.\n\nThis does not center the rhetoric on the suffering of Gazans. We hear more about Hamas did October 7th and how it\u2019s actually a good thing that Israel is defending itself (ie, using a terrorist attack as an excuse to commit human rights violations next door, and then later on managing to spark a regional war with the rest of its neighbors) than we do about the suffering of Palestinians. All we get for that is that they\u2019re starving and scared, even though, by the point Kamala had made this speech, Israel was already bombing their hospitals, stopping aid and bombing independent aid workers, and the crossing of Biden\u2019s supposed red line with the invasion of Rafah (which they crossed and then he proceeded to do nothing on anyway).\n\nIf you don\u2019t understand why this might not be good enough for Arab-Americans who she needs to convince to go vote for her, then I do not know what to tell you. She made it clear over and over again that she was not budging on the issue, deviating an inch from Biden, who is already unpopular for his approach, all the way up until the very end where she finally changed her rhetoric to focus more on the Palestinian victims of the war.\n\nAgain, if she cared about Arab voters, she would have let a Palestinian-American speaker have a few minutes at the DNC. She gave a spot for an Israeli-American to talk, and it would not have cost them PR points to set up a few minutes for someone directly impacted by the war to be able to speak. The Undecided delegation even said they sent the DNC a copy of their speech to vet over for inflammatory language or anything that goes against the state\u2019s foreign policy on the matter and the DNC still wouldn\u2019t work with them.\n\nIf I was an Arab-American who is looking at the current administration  potentially helping bomb the shit out of my friends and neighbors overseas, and the official position has not been kind toward them, I\u2019m capable and empathetic enough to sit in their shoes to see why Kamala changing her rhetoric right now after seeing Trump trying to court Muslims might ring hollow to them.",

USA loses all leverage over Israel.  \n\nThat is, if all possible sanctions are enforced, USA has no more influence over Israel than it has over Iran or North Korea. That is to say, jack shit. The only leverage USA has over those countries is that USA can go to war and kill them. Why is North Korea sending troops to fight for Russia in Ukraine? Why is Iran funding proxy militias to conduct terror campaigns all over the middle east?\n\nBecause *what the fuck are you gonna do about it*? Sanction them? They're already maximally sanctioned.  If you take away your child's phone, you ground them, you cancel Christmas, where are you going to go from there? You are out of options for discipline unless you want to start beating your child. And your child knows you would never hit them. Geopolitics is no different. \n\nWell, it's a little bit different in this area.

There's been so much talk about how women are out to vote because of it, but is there so much voter apathy that we would be staring down the barrel of another Trump presidency had the Supreme Court not buried Roe v. Wade?\n\nQuite possibly. People are generally far more motivated by being personally impacted at an existential level. What was driving a lot of the culture war in the late sixties and early seventies was the draft and Vietnam. As soon as we got out of Vietnam and successfully deposed a President the wind left the sails of 'the Movement'. Nixon had been duly punished by 'the people' and no one was being personally threatened by the possibility of being drafted and sent to Vietnam to die in the jungles for some abstract idea like \"making the world safe for democracy\". \n\nThe thing about abortion is that it's as existential for women as Vietnam was for men. It's a decision that no woman comes to lightly. They may not like abortion and they may not want to abort but they see no other choice under the circumstances (circumstances that are almost totally a result of external pressures). The freedom to choose was always there if you had to resort to. Publically you could say how awful it is etc but it's still a safety valve if you need it. And it has been there for 50 years. Generations of women have grown up assuming that the right to choose will be there if they need it.\n\nMy hope is that an Equal Rights Amendment will be the unanticipated result of the Republican/Christian dog catching the car being driven by liberated women.",

Wade? \n\nIf the Supreme Court had not buried Roe v. Wade, that would mean Trump hadn't appointed judges who rule with the mindset of forcing their personal ideologies on the rest of the country. If Trump had appointed reasonable jurists who might lean conservative but still weigh their rulings according to the merits of the case, a second term for a president who would appoint such judges (instead of judges who would give him blanket immunity for all official acts, or even for any acts that would require using official acts as evidence) would not be nearly as scary.",

Putting Harris in office would prevent trump's day-1 agenda and give us at least one branch of government protecting our rights. But so what?\n\nTrump is simply the figurehead for a much larger, longer-term issue. The idea that we can have an experienced, level-headed, multiracial history-making candidate who is backed by nearly every celebrity of note on both sides of the aisle and run a nearly flawless (though short) campaign... and yet still be neck-and-neck with a microphone-fellating elderly criminal means the problem isn't Trump, it's like... half the american people who agree with his views and his message.\n\nEven if he goes away, what do people expect for the next election? The republicans will put another extreme right candidate up, probably a smoother talking one who's more outwardly palatable to the independent voters. The novelty of a female president will have worn off and the urgency that stems from \"Trump the Enemy\" will be gone, making it a challenge for Harris's re-election. Fear and division will still be effective republican strategies. The man will be gone, but everything else about the MAGA folks will still be around and more strategic than ever.\n\nI have no idea what the plan is to change the minds that need to be changed. I don't know how to get people to stop caring about trans bathrooms, or equating immigrants with crime. I'm not sure how we as a nation can get to a place where presidential elections are about boring policy disagreements and not have one side radically trying its best to dismantle democracy.",

Like people seem to forget that prior to his first term(and even during it) he was very charismatic, funny to listen to, and just generally a really good candidate in a \"Lets troll shit\" sorta way. And coming against so many kinda blah bureaucrats he had a novelty that really propelled him with Independents. However pretty quickly he butted heads with the moderate and established people he had on his team, got rid of them, and RAPIDLY took a turn towards ever darker extremes of the Conservative side, and all of this before his clear cognitive decline, and the overwhelming bitterness that consumed him after the Election loss and his cornucopia of felonies in an attempt to keep power.

         "MAGA\u2019s not going away, but Trump is definitely unique. No one else in the party, new or old, has the 4 decades in the cultural zeitgeist that Trump had at his back. He was able to dupe the horde because he\u2019s been parading around as America\u2019s Most Brilliant Businessman in books and television since the fuckin 1980s. The pump was primed for the uninformed proletariat to accept him as an anointed economic and political genius, the poster boy for American Royalty, the guy with an infallible eye for what works and the solid steel balls to separate the wheat from the chaff and send the weak links packing. You can\u2019t buy 40 years of cultural image-building, and PR Firms can\u2019t build it from scratch. \n\nLikewise, his pathology, the charismatic psychopath with malignant narcissism, gives him unique power over an audience that basically grew up with him as a household name. Vance is a sociopath, and he\u2019s deeply unappealing. DeSantis is a malignant narcissist but he has net zero charisma. Trump\u2019s kids have brand recognition, but they\u2019re all deeply unlikable and politically stupid. \n\nWithout Trump, MAGA may not go away, but it will definitely struggle. His exit will leave a power vacuum that will not be easy to fill.",

Heritage Foundation. Leonard Leo. They have been scheming this for years. \n\nI\u2019m very interested in how the snake wriggles without a head.

With him gone, all the pretenders would scramble to take his place and the most devoted of his base wouldn't stand for anyone other than him. It would take at least two election cycles for the party to get their shit together enough to run someone that could unite the factions, and even then their most reliable voting block will have effectively halved as Boomers start to die en masse.\n\nThis is the most important because it's our last shot to get it right,",

And Palin wasn\u2019t like an existential threat as VP, nor did she seem at the time any worse than the whole economic collapse we were experience at the time.\n\nI think a better question than what you posed is, when was the last time an election before 2016 felt like it had such a drastic difference between the candidates and direction we\u2019d go? There\u2019s an argument some of the 60s & 70s elections had that flavor due to the Cold War and Vietnam, but I could also see an argument that nothing since the Civil War & Reconstruction era have felt as stark as these last three elections.",

         "Jon Ralston is probably *the* most knowledgeable person regarding Nevada politics, he's accurately predicted the statewide winners in Nevada for at least the past three elections. However, he's predicting that it will be an extremely close election, with Harris pulling through by only 0.3%. His final prediction is Harris: 48.5%, Trump: 48.2%, others and None of These Candidates: 3.3%. But still, a close win is a win, and I'll take a close victory for Harris in Nevada. Let's all go vote and make it happen.",

He definitely has the pulse on Nevada politics, which can be very tricky at times.\n\nWhile his predictions are not 100% accurate, he has only been off a few times. In 2022, he accurately predicted every single statewide race, and the only prediction he was off on was a Congressional race in Vegas that he said the Republican would win. They ended up losing.\n\nThis race will undoubtedly be close, but if I were a betting man (and I'm not) I would comfortably use Ralstons predictions to determine who I'd wager for.",

         "The Character and Eligibility of Donald Trump: A Critical Examination.\n\nThis paper examines Donald Trump\u2019s character and constitutional eligibility to serve as president, focusing on the disqualification clause in the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. A central argument is that his impeachment by Congress unequivocally establishes his ineligibility, as he engaged in insurrection on January 6th, 2021. He conspired with others to have Vice President Pence reject state-certified electors and incited his supporters into rebellion. Under the Constitution, such actions disqualify him from holding public office, mirroring historical precedents where Congress or governors have refused to certify the elections of individuals deemed by them to be insurrectionists. America\u2019s most esteemed presidents, like George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, are celebrated not only for their leadership but for their unwavering integrity and commitment to democratic principles. Washington\u2019s humility and dedication set the foundational values of the nation, while Lincoln\u2019s moral conviction preserved its unity during its most perilous times. In stark contrast, Trump\u2019s conduct\u2014both during his tenure and specifically on January 6th\u2014reveals a profound deficiency in character. His reckless and divisive actions pose a direct threat to the very fabric of democracy. This paper argues that, based on constitutional mandates and the essential qualities required of a president, Trump\u2019s character and actions categorically disqualify him from the presidency, irrespective of policy positions or partisan affiliations.\n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/384473246_The_Character_and_Eligibility_of_Donald_Trump_A_Critical_Examination/stats",

Some tidbits,  \n\n> But this cycle, with former President Donald Trump and Co. discovering it might be smart to encourage Republicans to vote early and even by mail (the horror!), the GOP vote has been frontloaded. The inverse is true and the question is whether the Democrats can overcome a 43,000-plus GOP ballot lead as I write this.\n> \n> But my theory of the case is there are still a lot of Clark County mail ballots to be counted that favor Democrats and the GOP partial cannibalization of its Election Day vote will propel some Democrats to victory but perhaps not quite get there with others.\n> \n> I have been calling this The Unicorn Election because of the unusual voting patterns.   \n> \n> The key to this election has always been which way the non-major-party voters break because they have become the plurality in the state. They are going to make up 30 percent or so of the electorate and if they swing enough towards Harris, she will win Nevada.  \n> \n> I know some may think this reflects my well-known disdain for Trump, heart over data. But that is not so. I have often predicted against my own preferences; history does not lie. I just have a feeling she will catch up here, but I also believe \u2013 and please remember this \u2013 it will not be clear who won on Election Night here, so block out the nattering nabobs of election denialism.

Poor rally and event attendance, generally less signage and canvassing, Individual contributions are down. And I\u2019m seeing his ability to say anything with no repercussions waining more and more and even Fox News has started being out of step with him periodically. Even the people on his peripheral are causing blowback on him. The Tony Hinchcliffe standup seems like it really angered a large portion of the Puerto Rican community. If even a quarter of them in the swing states decide to stay home and not vote for trump that is a major blow. \n\nI grew up outside Springfield Ohio and much of my family and extended family is still there. Many of them are Republicans but not MAGA. I have spoke to a lot of them since the \u201cthey are eating the pets\u201d debacle. Some are voting Harris most are just not voting for Trump. Trump really pissed a ton of people off around the Springfield area. Bringing that shade, then the numerous bomb threats, neo Nazi and KKK showing up to March around. \n\nJD Vance was suppose to join Trump as a savy Yale educated young man, with some diversity with a mixed race family. Instead he has been a constant laughing stock and keeps diving in likability and it feels like Ohioans and even folks from his home town don\u2019t care for him. \n\nAnyways I hope I\u2019m right, but from my personal observations, I can\u2019t see him performing better than he did in 2020, while Harris and Walz have reinvigorated democrats apathetic over Biden and it\u2019s now much more than just never Trump. They have ran a phenomenal campaign, and the right hasn\u2019t been able to get anything to stick to her. \n\nI feel she will outperform Biden in 2020.

Either folks that have come to that on their own, or were influenced by these senior Republicans.\n\nThere are lots of anecdotes of people knowing conservative friends or family members that are voting for a Democrat for the first time, ever, for some of them.\n\nAnd there's clearly a lot of support for abortion within the Republican electorate. This is made plain when protection for abortion is on the ballot alongside positions to be filled. The politicians get voted on in what is close to the normal political lean of the location, but abortion gets somewhere in the neighborhood of 70% support. It's not necessarily super crazy that those people that both vote red and support abortion would vote against the guy that facilitated the end of Roe.\n\nSo, put all that together, you've got pretty strong evidence of some crossover voting, and who might be doing that crossing over, but no great sense of how much or what the final impact will be. Could it legitimately be like 15% shift toward Harris? That would be crazy. Is it impossible?... probably not.\n\nNot likely. Probably much less. Will it turn this election into a landslide?\n\nThere's a viable theory how it might. And, my own personal opinion being that it should have been a landslide back in the Republican primary in 2016, barring Trump from even getting the nomination, it's of course attractive to me to think that theory has some merit.\n\nBut margin of error being what it is, it's equally likely that this is going to, yet again, be a much closer election than I believe it has any right to be.",

Because it's sounds great in theory, it helps them resolve the moral quandary of wanting to control other people's bodies without coming across as cruel bastards. \n\nBut think about what \"exception for the life of the mother\" mean. Imagine we took the same approach for all other medical issues. No treatment for headaches & migraines unless the life of the patient is in danger. Imagine a shark bites off your foot and you're taken quickly to the hospital and doctors just stand around waiting for you to be near death before intervening. Imagine how much fucking pain people will be needlessly subjected to and how many people will die for no reason at all. Next time you hear that bullshit phrase, realize what the person is saying: I want women to suffer needlessly till they're at the point of death before we give them routine medical care.

Our family has Irish origins and we are in contact with our relatives abroad so I was hoping this with resonate with her.

Her (divorced) mother had schizophrenia, and disappreared without warning one day when she was only 8, leaving neighbours to find her father and send her there. \n\n(The other cases I know were life of the mother, with severe kidney disease, and one where twins had basically half a brain between them, unlikey to survive outside the womb for very long.)\n\nNo woman decides at the 7th or 8th month -\"I changed my mind, I don't want a child\". When the Republicans trot out that lie, they are just lying to create fear.  Nobody murders a baby after birth - in no state is that legal.

Some women may be OK with an abortion when they consider what it could have done to their life to have a child at that time, but never is it a casual decision. \n\nAnd we are seeing today, there are often valid serious medical reasons why treatment around pregnancy problems should never be complicated by legalities. It's dangerous. It can be lethal. \n\n(And a a side note, many states that do have such onerous laws are having trouble attracting new doctors.

They never make demands of you; they are morally uncomplicated, unlike the incarcerated, addicted, or the chronically poor; they don\u2019t resent your condescension or complain that you are not politically correct; unlike widows, they don\u2019t ask you to question patriarchy; unlike orphans, they don\u2019t need money, education, or childcare; unlike aliens, they don\u2019t bring all that racial, cultural, and religious baggage that you dislike; they allow you to feel good about yourself without any work at creating or maintaining relationships; and when they are born, you can forget about them, because they cease to be unborn. You can love the unborn and advocate for them without substantially challenging your own wealth, power, or privilege, without re-imagining social structures, apologizing, or making reparations to anyone. They are, in short, the perfect people to love if you want to claim you love Jesus, but actually dislike people who breathe. Prisoners? Immigrants? The sick? The poor? Widows? Orphans? All the groups that are specifically mentioned in the Bible? They all get thrown under the bus for the unborn.\u201d",

The only thing they'll advocate is abstinence until marriage because it's not about abortions or families or babies or any of that, it's about making sure people who have sex are punished.\n\nCorrect. One of the biggest eye-openers is how much they are against funding for chronically underfunded foster care systems, and even the very idea of expanding ideas like WIC to all parents, medical coverage for child birth, and so on.\n\nMake it easier to have or give a child up for adoption in good conscience?

No one's going around having abortions for fun but if they did it would literally not matter at all, a fetus is blatantly not a person at least for quite a while into a pregnancy, it has no rights, it has no mind, it doesn't even have a functioning brain for a hell of a long time into the pregnancy.

         "Here's his [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UIzsPIrZdc)\n\nHere's the original speech written by the Twilight Zone writer Rod Sterling he performed up on stage with MLKJr. \n\nLike he said, \"1964\u2014a lot\u2019s happened, not so much as Martin Luther King Jr. dreamed of, but it\u2019s a start.\"\n\n> Ladies and gentlemen, this may be the most non-political speech you ever hear. And, indeed, if you look for controversy, what I\u2019m about to say conjures up little conflict.\n> \n> We have reached a moment in time when restless men, dispossessed men, angry and impatient men, and anguished men look up and reach out for an elusive justice oft promised them, long denied them, but in the eyes of God and man\u2019s conscience is their due and should be their expectation. I say this is non-political and non-controversial. We\u2019re not talking now about miscegenation. Or whether a man can fence his yard. Or a hotdog vendor carefully select his customer. Or an innkeeper choose not to accommodate a particular traveler. These are the ramifications of the problem. They are not the problem. There have to be some bridges built; but first we have to acknowledge the rivers.\n> \n> \n> This is what I think is basic. This is what I believe to be the most common denominator in this spring of 1964. This must be first, the recognition and then the admission \u2014 that the dignity of human beings is not negotiable. The eminent worth of man has no pro and no con. And the desperate need for an understanding and a respect between all men is as fundamental as the process of breathing in and breathing out.\n> \n> On this spring night we look toward Washington, D.C., and hear the the echoed overtones of a debate. We watch the struggle to invoke a cloture. We hear the voices of the willful foot-draggers and the hopeful sprinters as they trade and compromise and give battle for what they believe. But again, there is something happening on this earth transcendent of the Senates, the governments, the temporal voices of the champions of rights and the filibusters of wrong.\n> \n> What is happening is that a whole world has suddenly become cognizant of its oneness. An idea of brotherhood has ceased to be an abstract. It has taken on a form and dimension and breadth and meaning. \u201cEvery man\u2019s death diminishes me\u201d \u2014 a lyrical stab at truth from another century. But in this nineteen hundred and sixth fourth year of our Lord, every man\u2019s indignity, every man\u2019s hunger, every man\u2019s search for freedom, every man\u2019s life reinforces me and revitalizes me and rededicates me. \u201cWe cannot be half-free and half-slave,\u201d Mr. Lincoln said. And now, a hundred years later, we find that we cannot be half hungry and half content; half with dignity, half with shame; half with freedom, half with a simple yearning to be free; half with prerogatives, half asking for just a few; half superior, half denied the right to prove even equality.\n> \n> \n> \u201cYou cannot legislate human love.\u201d Have you heard that phrase? \u201cYou cannot pass a law to stop people from hating\u201c \u2014 a battle slogan of those who don\u2019t want to be bothered. A statement of philosophy from 20th century non-philosophers who would probably melt down the test tubes used to look for the microbes and the bacteria and the virus that caused cancer. Cancer is with us, so why fight it? Leave it to the individual patients. But don\u2019t make waves. Don\u2019t stir the river bed. And above all, don\u2019t contemplate the beauty of this earth. The deeds of love. The small, gradual, but inexorable move upward of the human animal toward an enlightened moment in time when the person next door is the neighbor, the Negro is the darker neighbor, the South American is my Latin neighbor, the Japanese is my Oriental neighbor.\n> \n> You can\u2019t legislate against prejudice? You would rather perhaps accept it as part of the innate personality of the homo sapien? You would rather say that it\u2019s with us, it\u2019s here to stay, it\u2019s part of the social phenomenon of our time. If this is the premise to be lived with, accepted, and \u2014 God help us \u2014 embraced, then let us throw away theology. Let us unencumber ourselves of the premise of God. Let us tear up our art, our literature, all of our culture, and let us retire to a rubble of our own making and manufacture barbed wire instead of stained glass.\n> \n> Hatred is not the norm. Prejudice is not the norm. Suspicion, dislike, jealousy, and scapegoating \u2014 none of these things is the transcendent facet of the human personality. They are the diseases. They are the cancers of the soul. They are the infectious and contagious viruses that have bled humanity over the years. But because they have been and are, is it necessary that they shall be?\n> \n> \n> I think not. If there is one voice left to say \u201cwelcome\u201d to a stranger; if there is but one hand outstretched to say \u201center and share\u201d; if there is but one mind remaining to think a thought of warmth and friendship, then there is also a future in which we will find more than one hand, more than one voice, and more than one mind dedicated to the cause of man\u2019s equality.\n> \n> Wishful, hopeful, unassured, problematic, and not to be guaranteed. This is all true. But again, on this spring evening of 1964, a little of man\u2019s awareness has shown itself. A little of his essential decency, his basic goodness, his preeminent dignity, has been made a matter of record. There will be moments of violence and expressions of hatred and an ugly re-echo of intolerance, but these are the clinging vestiges of a decayed past, not the harbingers of the better, cleaner future. To those who tell us that the inequality of the human animal is the necessary evil, we must respond by simply saying that first, it is evil but second, it is not necessary. We prove it, sitting here tonight. We prove it by reaffirming our faith. We prove it by having faith in our reaffirmations.\n> \n> Horace Mann said, \u201cBe ashamed to die until you have won some victory for humanity.\u201d Let\u2019s paraphrase that tonight. Let us be ashamed to live without that victory.",

Even if you have an otherwise healthy relationship, maybe politics is just something you don't talk about most of the time, and when election time comes, you nod, agree, then get back on with your life, having not disrupted your peace.\n\nOf course, you also have the outliers like Gingrich who thinks lying to your husband about your vote is the equivalent of cheating, and grounds for a divorce . . . yeah, that's not emotional blackmail right there.\n\nFact is, everyone should be free to vote for who they want without fear based on the issues that are important to them, and there is no harm in reminding them of that freedom (hell, they honestly should have had the same ads for men since there's a fair number of anecdotes about prior Trumper's not wanting to let their people know they voted for Harris this time for fear of getting kicked out of their friend's group, and I suppose the reverse could also be true.",
         "Well doesn't that mean the statement \"What happens in the booth stays in the booth\" is just as relevant for your wife then. It's just that the Harris campaign gather that the more people feel safe in their right to privacy, the more votes go to Harris.",

I've seen it once and not been able to bring myself to do anything.  Tell myself it's just one vote.\n\n(As an aside, be a little bit careful in judging particularly if the people are elderly as it is perfectly legal to assist a partner in voting as long as you set it up properly beforehand.  In that case there literally is nothing the poll workers can do, even if the process is being abused.  Not saying this was even the case in any of the instances you witnessed, just in general.

         "I do feel like we should address that the polls that tend to show that are often missing some critical data points. We are at a much higher rate of having suffered abuse, yes, but we also have a large cohort of us will try to date men to be \"normal\" and because we don't have attraction to men we tend to just kind of pick one, based on peer pressure or what have you. That puts us at a much higher risk of experiencing abuse from an intimate partner before we start dating women. I'm not saying abuse doesn't happen in lesbian relationships between two women, but people who love to bandy that point around (often right wingers) miss critical explanatory context.",

We're not cops, and we're not precisely enforcers either.  We're there to facilitate the vote, not to worry overmuch about whether John who is chatting casually with Sally while in line to use the scanner is actually intimidating her.  We do a little bit of reminding about the guidelines where they are being flagrantly violated, but not a ton.  Mostly it would be in the form of people who are actually talking to us.\n\nIn general, people's expectations of what we can and are expected to do are vastly over-inflated.  Even by ourselves sometimes.  I once brought up a guy who came to my polling place in a confederate flag sweatshirt, asking if he could be asked to leave for intimidation.  And I was told no.  This was by a Democratic elections supervisor, in a purple county in New York.\n\nDuring presidential elections, we're also very, very busy.

         "I can answer this question.  Starlink, or Starshield as it is known in military circles, has a finite life.  It constantly needs fed new satellites.\n \n The satellites are designed to fall out of orbit and burn up.  That is their strength.  Low latency due to the proximity to the ground. \n\nThe network is not fully up yet.  Thousands more satellites are needed on-station, to be replaced at regular intervals.  Starship, and it's heavy lift capacity are needed to ensure continuity.  And Starship is still just in the test-flight stage.  If the military takes it over now, who is going to run it?  Boeing?",

         "TL;DR: The President is the highest authority at the Department of Justice -- they're it's boss's boss.  So if Trump wins, he'll probably kill any case that starts now.  If Harris does, it would continue.  So no sense in starting until after the election results are in.\n\nA case like this would take years to resolve, and if Biden does it now and Trump wins tomorrow, he will be able to tell the DOJ to abandon (or heavily deprioritize) their prosecution of Musk in January.\n\nOn the other hand, if Harris wins, Biden *could* do it now.  Harris wouldn't shut the case down; she'd likely continue the case, so her DOJ would effectively give the case a 2-month head start when her administration starts.",
         "The investigation has already been ongoing for some time, but Trump is corrupt as hell and Elon has donated a ton of money to his campaign, so obviously Trump will just kill any investigations into Elon\u2019s companies if he becomes president.\n\nCases like this take a long time to build. I expect the feds are close to pressing charges given Elon\u2019s increasingly erratic behavior, his desperate efforts to inflate the stock, and the number of Tesla executives that have resigned from the company in the past year - but who knows.\n\nThey also have to be careful with timing because Tesla stock is worth *so much* that if it implodes, the fallout will be massive. A lot of retirement funds, pension funds and investment portfolios have stakes in Tesla.\n\nPressing charges now would also give the right wing ammo to claim Biden is prosecuting his political enemies, which is obviously absurd, but the general public might not see it that way.\n\nIn short, it would be political suicide for the Biden DoJ to go after him now.",

         "Pre-pandemic, the NC State Fair utilized the iconic Dorton Arena with its wild Googie-adjacent space age architecture (according to Wikipedia, \u201cthe first structure in the world to use a cable-supported roof\u201d) as the spot for tentpole concerts every night. They would always ensure a mix of artists, though of course heavily leaning on contemporary country. There was always a Praise Music night for the white people, and often (but not always) a Black gospel night. There were usually at least one or two headliners of the sort you expect from state fairs \u2014 washed up hair metal bands, 90s rock one-hit wonders, etc. But over the years I had the good fortune to see Willie Nelson, the Chi-Lites and the Delfonics, and one of the final dozen or so performances of George Jones. I say all this to preface the fact that, when there isn\u2019t a state fair happening, Dorton is not a real event venue. Post-pandemic, even the state fair doesn\u2019t book acts there anymore. They\u2019ll maybe put a boat or hot tub show or whatever in there on a given Saturday. There are many viable, actual venues in the Triangle they could\u2019ve chosen. They picked Dorton because of the likelihood he could fill it (lol at how that turned out), and I suspect because he could con Raleigh into letting him do it without having to prepay (like Asheville made him do). It\u2019s honestly not that far off from Four Seasons Total Landscaping in terms of cred. If people didn\u2019t show up, it wasn\u2019t because of parking (ample) or traffic (it\u2019s right off the interstate near an actual arena that hosts the Carolina Hurricanes and many high-profile concerts, and expertly manages event traffic several days a week).\n\nKamala, by contrast, packed out Raleigh\u2019s long-standing outdoor venue (known locally as \u201cWalnut Creek\u201d though it\u2019s changed ownership several times over the years, from banks to Hardee\u2019s to cellphone carriers). \n\nIf an election can be called based on crowd sizes, it\u2019s not even close.",

Their campaign has been not paying for their rallies and stuffing places and people left and right.  Roe  being overturned was a huge FU to all women.

So if there are lots of people going to rallies, we can guess they are enthusiastic about that candidate.  Enthusiastic people tend to vote, so it's a good sign.\n\nIn the past, nobody really talked about crowd sizes at political rallies.  Trump, because he is a crowd size queen, made it out to be a sign of his popularity.  His shiny new Press Secretary told his first lie on his first day at the podium in the press room - he was directed by Trump to lie about Trump's Inauguration Day crowd size being bigger than Obama's, bigger than any Inauguration in history, even though we saw the pictures side by side with our own eyes.

It\u2019s also worrying to me that he still seems to have so many supporters for being such a shit person as a human being and at basically everything. We project what we know everywhere and my projection is most people support him. It\u2019s basically what I see and what I know.\n\nSo that\u2019s where my fear lies.

Lots of American flags, lots of racism, their candidate is bigger and meaner and will \"kick ass\". So to Trump's voters, seeing this lack of support at these rallies matters. It matters more than it should.",

The only reason the State department *might* get involved with SpaceX is with the import of a satellite from another nation, but the US Customs Department's got all of that handled 99.999% of the time.\n\nSpaceX being a leader of technologies is true, but the US is not even *slightly* worried about keeping it \"stateside.\" If Elon Musk attempted to remove it from the state, for any reason, the US would not allow such a move. If he's threatened to, or sold SpaceX's secrets to a non-US state, he's probably violated US law on export restrictions of military industrial secrets - ITAR and similar laws prohibit the transfer of certain kinds of sensitive technology, including rocket engineering. \n\nI could go on, but really, what's the point.

When we are pressured to have sex as teenagers and the emotional fear of the possibility of pregnancy is terrifying and we try to trust men but the risks can be catastrophic.  I\u2019m 64 and I\u2019ve never had a baby but I\u2019ve had scares a few times, twice the man told me I was on my own and he would leave.  Economic issues are vital in women\u2019s lives in even contemplating having children and then being able to raise the children.  It can be a minefield if you don\u2019t have an education to help make a good living.  I\u2019ve been through those fears and women should have the choice whether or not they can have a baby.  I wonder sometimes if people who are pro life have ever considered that a woman might get pregnant tell the father and be left all alone, which makes it completely different environment for raising a child.  She may not economically be able to do it. I know people tell you that shit lol if there\u2019s a will, there\u2019s a way.   Well, if you want your child to have everything good in life and you have to provide it you may not be able to on your own.  It didn\u2019t work out well for me. I wasn\u2019t able to have a stable relationship and have a baby. By the time I became financially capable I was over 40.  Things just didn\u2019t work out that way for me.  So I do understand the risks.  For the government to tell a woman if you\u2019re pregnant, you have to have the baby is cruel. It\u2019s very cruel.  And the fact that women are dying because they can\u2019t get care when something is wrong.. that in itself is sickening in this day and age.  The fact that Trump brags about killing Roe makes me hate him.  Because he literally has no goddamn idea what he\u2019s done.  It\u2019s all that male power bullshit.  And it\u2019s true they underestimate women\u2019s anger.  We don\u2019t want other women to suffer like we have and we will fight for them to have the things that we couldn\u2019t.  But that\u2019s what happens when you repress people for years.  You better stand back when they get a little power back cause they\u2019ll drive it right over you.

For their base, they assume that they don't WANT their daughters and grand-daughters to get abortions.\n\nUltimately its that they can't put themselves into women's shoes and see how much of a threat abortion bans are to them, and its even harder for them to see how women who won't need abortions can empathize with women who might. I think a lot of this boils down to a lack of empathy. They can't see how an safe and legal abortion service is this super important and relief giving safety net that yes, no one wants to have to use, but so many are thankful and feel safer when they know they can if they need to.",

Basically it seems clear that pollsters are doing a lot of \"correction\", which makes their results kinda... meaningless? Skewed, at the very least. But this is why the Selzer poll was such a big deal, because Ann Selzer famously doesn't herd and isn't afraid to go against everyone else, and her polling has been pretty accurate for the most part.

He conspired with others to have Vice President Pence reject state-certified electors and incited his supporters into rebellion. Under the Constitution, such actions disqualify him from holding public office, mirroring historical precedents where Congress or governors have refused to certify the elections of individuals deemed by them to be insurrectionists. America\u2019s most esteemed presidents, like George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, are celebrated not only for their leadership but for their unwavering integrity and commitment to democratic principles. Washington\u2019s humility and dedication set the foundational values of the nation, while Lincoln\u2019s moral conviction preserved its unity during its most perilous times. In stark contrast, Trump\u2019s conduct\u2014both during his tenure and specifically on January 6th\u2014reveals a profound deficiency in character. His reckless and divisive actions pose a direct threat to the very fabric of democracy. This paper argues that, based on constitutional mandates and the essential qualities required of a president, Trump\u2019s character and actions categorically disqualify him from the presidency, irrespective of policy positions or partisan affiliations.\n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/384473246_The_Character_and_Eligibility_of_Donald_Trump_A_Critical_Examination/stats",

A central argument is that his impeachment by Congress unequivocally establishes his ineligibility, as he engaged in insurrection on January 6th, 2021. He conspired with others to have Vice President Pence reject state-certified electors and incited his supporters into rebellion. Under the Constitution, such actions disqualify him from holding public office, mirroring historical precedents where Congress or governors have refused to certify the elections of individuals deemed by them to be insurrectionists. America\u2019s most esteemed presidents, like George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, are celebrated not only for their leadership but for their unwavering integrity and commitment to democratic principles. Washington\u2019s humility and dedication set the foundational values of the nation, while Lincoln\u2019s moral conviction preserved its unity during its most perilous times. In stark contrast, Trump\u2019s conduct\u2014both during his tenure and specifically on January 6th\u2014reveals a profound deficiency in character. His reckless and divisive actions pose a direct threat to the very fabric of democracy. This paper argues that, based on constitutional mandates and the essential qualities required of a president, Trump\u2019s character and actions categorically disqualify him from the presidency, irrespective of policy positions or partisan affiliations.\n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/384473246_The_Character_and_Eligibility_of_Donald_Trump_A_Critical_Examination/stats",

Then my wife started to cry. \n\nSo yeah, we might have to skip the holidays this year because we\u2019re either going to be pissed and her dad will gloat, or he\u2019ll be pissed and tell us how disappointed he is that we supported a whatever kind of person Kamala is.",

         "This reminds me of the fox domestication experiment. A very long running project in Russia where foxes were selected for their absence of fear when approached by a human instead of cowering away in fear and allowing the human contact and even show the curiosity you mention.\n\nSelective breeding increased this. The brains of the tamer animals showed neurochemical changes like increased serotonin levels.\n\n>Perhaps the most important observation emerging from this series of experiments is the fact that tame females exhibit statistically significant changes in certain neurochemical characteristics in such regions of the brain as the hypothalamus, midbrain, and hippocampus. The level of serotonin and its metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid turned out to be higher in tame than in unselected females. This fact fits the type of behavior, since serotonin is known to inhibit some kinds of aggression. Serotonin plays a role in the central regulation of the hypothalmic-hypophyseal-adrenal-sexual system. Thus, selection for tame behavior is associated with changes in both the central and peripheral mechanisms of the neuro-endocrine control of ontogeny.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domesticated_silver_fox\n\nInteresting is that the opposite was also tried.\n\n>Breeding for aggression\n\n>After initiating his selective breeding program for tameness, Belyayev also began breeding a line of fearful, aggressive foxes. In addition, he started domesticating other animals. He and his team started working with rats in 1972, and later with minks and, briefly, with river otters, although this last experiment was abandoned because the species \"proved difficult to breed\". The experiments with rats and minks, however, proved successful, with the subjects becoming tame alongside the foxes. After Belyayev's death, his rat experiment was carried on by Irina Plyusnina. \"Siberian gray rats caught in the wild, bred separately for tameness and for ferocity\", reported The New York Times, \"have developed ... entirely different behaviors in only 60 or so generations\".[8] When geneticist Svante P\u00e4\u00e4bo was in Novosibirsk in 2003, he visited the institute, and \"was stunned\" by the two groups of rats. \"After just 30 years of selection\", P\u00e4\u00e4bo said, \"the IC&G researchers had fashioned two populations that could hardly be more different.\"\n\nWhat if more peace loving Democrats and more agressive Republicans prefer partners from their own group and this results in selective 'breeding' causing similar enhancement of these traits as was achieved in these animal experiments?

         "It got sent back down to PA courts, which Trump can't pardon.",
         "This is exactly what he is doing. And probably a lot of other illegal things that he has done will be pardoned.",
         "And if it's not randomly selected, then he committed massive fraud against the people who signed up under the impression they were entered into a giveaway.  Crime either way.",
         "Harris: We hereby pardon this turkey.\n\n*Gun shot in the distance*\n\nWalz: *Walks up carrying a dead turkey.* I got dinner!",
         "Totally. Not sure if I like Leon, Elmo or space Karen better.\u00a0",
         "Hm ok. I remember looking into a Mr beast sweepstakes recently and it required you either send him a photo of your receipt with his chocolate bar, or you tag something on Instagram with a piece of paper in the photo you submitted which sounded pretty laborious\u2026",
         "This is why when you used to get coke bottle or rewards from them they ALWAYS make sure to note no purchase (ie no proof of purchase through receipts) necessary.",
         "Yeh, seems like this \"defense\" just means the PAC would be charged with running an illegal lottery *and* fraud.",
         "Trump's lawyers end up like Giuliani did, holding the bag for him.",
         "> (I guess by omission)\n\nlying by omission is not illegal though. lawyers literally play word games with laws.",
         "My friend was pretty successful but after spending the time and money he found that he really didn't like being a lawyer.  He set himself a goal to be at X income by the time he was 54 and then he would retire. He didn't quite make 54, but he was retired by 56. He still does an occasional consult with his previous employer and has helped family and friends with legal medical advice but he always warns that free advice is frequently worth exactly what you paid for it.",
         "\"If I hear objection, sustained one more time I'm gonna scream!!\"",
         "I\u2019m not wearing a tie at all.",
         "All transactions over a certain wealth will become complimentary with a mandatory gratuity.",
         "Bruh. I've heard it covered multiple times in multiple different outlets.",
         "Yeah if you read the transcript from his hearing at the time of the hearing he had spent 16 million and the prosecution said they were seeking far more than that. But I agree with you i doubt any amount of money they fine him will not make a difference. \n\nBut over the Putin stuff I think his ability to handle and operate these defense contracts and the hardware associated will be severely limited. SpaceX is dependent on government contracts and Tesla was only so successful because of EV subsidies.",
         "Ketamine Christ.",
         "Honestly sounds like a good psychological trick.\n\nIf the answer is a flat no tell them to give you a day or two to look into it, then tell them no.\n\nIt's done all the time in software, a lot of stuff can run faster than you can blink, but if it does people don't think it's done anything. So they add a fake loading bar with a few seconds delay.",
         "And all they have to give up is their souls.",
         "Paid? By Musk? I'll believe it when I see it",
         "Yes, but he admitted to actions that could lead to *federal* cases in the future. He's basically saying, \"it wasn't this crime because I committed a different crime. You have to let me go.\"\n\nThe different crime in this case is a federal crime, allowing Trump to pardon *that* crime. He's playing crime roulette hoping Trump will save him.",
         "If trump wins, I'm not sure we can count on things he \"can't\" do anymore, that's predicated entirely on him following the law and not becoming a dictator.",
         "like multiple one on one personal conversations with Putin",
         "Isn't he under investigation for illegal sweepstakes though?",
         "Not all of them. The smart ones charge him up front, make a bunch of cash, then jump ship before they ever make headlines.",
         "Thought we were talking about attorneys here",
         "Oh, got ya, I didn't realize it was so complex, I'll have to read up!",
         "If it isn't random, he's just paying someone cash to vote a certain way. The pardon gambit was the less obvious part. \n\nhttps://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/597"
