         "He had interviews on the street recorded on Wednesday, asking them how they were going to vote *that* day, and the respondents were all vastly ignorant. They didn't know the election was the previous day, or Biden wasn't on the ballot, and lied about having seen people at polling stations that day. Political ignorance is not just a rural phenomenon.",

It was a bad night for everyone who voted for him too \u2013 you just don\u2019t realize it yet,\u201d he added, to applause from the studio audience.\n\nI'm going to point this out to every Trump voter who goes all shocked pikachu face when they realize their eggs don't magically cost $1 and there are still immigrants living in their neighborhood.",
         "I know people who voted for tRump who never listen to any of his speeches. Sheep following the wolf",
         "15,000,000 Democrats who voted in 2020 simply didn't show up to vote in 2024.  Those people sealed the fate of what's coming next.\n\nTrump got 3,000,000 less votes.  People didn't go red.  Third party votes were minimal, so they didn't go that way either.  Nope.  They just didn't show up.\n\nWhat a dumb way to absolutely screw an entire country.\n\nThis was not an election of politics.  It wasn't about parties or candidates this time.  This was saving the government from what's now going to happen next.\n\nThis fucking sucks, and we are now not the ones able to save this institution.\n\nThe dumb part is the federal government needs to protect itself through policy or force form what is coming to dismantle it from the inside out.\n\nTrump I don't even worry about.  He can be president for 4 years, and those 4 years is a mess and infective.  It's not even about Trump this time.  It's about Vance, Thiel, project 2025, and the systematic replacement of all appointable people and then all the appointees firing and replacing everyone they can, and then those new hires firing and replacing everyone they can.  This was Vance's own words pretty much day stating this. His plan is to replace everyone he possibly can. And it will be people who don't have your interest nor the government's interest at heart.  The word coup isn't a light word to use, but this is the best descriptor of what happens next.  \n\nAnd the leadership? Trump was just the tool to get votes.  His job is done.  He's now dead weight and I highly suspect we'll see his forceful removal, not by Democrats, but by Republicans. Then Vance becomes president, not by vote but by placement.  Vance is no leader either, but...he's an exceptional puppet. Of whom? Thiel who backed him, threw cash at Trump and the Republican party to place with the dependency of placing Vance as VP.  Thiel and others just bought the presidency.  And now all it takes is the removal of Trump. You didn't vote for Vance.  It was not earned, not democratic.  Good position was bought.  And his goal is to be president, like right now of he could.  And then Thiel starts pulling those strings making that puppet dance.  And you'll start seeing president Vance systematically destroy the federal government as we know it. I don't even care about most of project 2025 at this point. It's the systematic removal of people, destroying or permanently disabling federal agencies, having corporate yes men in those agencies who don't act for the department but Thiel and the ultra wealthy.  EPA, FDA, USPS, DOJ, every department, all of them, will be mutilated.\n\nHere's the real problem.  You can't fix this after. This damage is permanent.  The federal government as we know it is fucked. Period. That's what's coming next.\n\nAnd I hope I'm wrong.  I hope this isn't the reality that's coming.  But everything points to it.  And of it does play out, our nation is fucked, proper fucked.\n\nThis wasn't an election of party.  It was risk mitigation, and the risk of this happening is non zero. And this non zero ends democracy and turns this government into a puppet regime. This non zero is what a coup looks like. And I so very much hope it doesn't happen. You know when it starts, when it really starts, when you see Republicans vote to remove Trump too and you see no residence to Vance and the sea of replacements.  That's the end point of any means to stopping this. Then welcome to a new America. It has no Biden, no Harris, no Trump, no one you recognize nor voted for.  You are no longer part of the game.  This is no longer a democracy.  This nation ends.\n\nThis nation ends.\n\nAnd 15,000,000 stayed at home and made this non zero risk happen.\n\nAll we do now is wait and see if it happens.",
         "Yesterday I went into a restaurant and there was a table of 8 or 9 women. They were all dressed in red dresses, with MAGA hats on.  They had not one, but two life size(height wise) cardboard cut outs of Trump at the table with them.  \nI just can't believe in this day and age, with what we know of Trump's character, that they would publicly brag about their support for him.",
         "Personally I think we are all seeing four things in the USA which coalesce into a Republican stranglehold.  All of which have been stated before but not compounding each other.\n\n**1. Flooding the endzone**\n\nIt is clear that Western democratic states are now completely *saturated* in misinformation, astroturfing and propaganda. It's been well documented but it's likely we have not even scratched the surface of the true extent.  Foreign states, non-state actors, special interest groups; the general populace is absolutely *drenched* in a non-stop torrent of misleading information.  It's inescapable.  It infects every facet of our life.  And if you avoid it or limit it, you have to deal with co-workers or family members who do not.  It exhausts critical evaluation and political discussion...which is the point.  One one hand you feed a dizzying spectacle of non-stop content poisoned with nonsense and on the other you serve a buffet of bread and circus.\n\n**2.  The Overton Window has shifted**\n\nWe are undeniably moving towards a far-right autocratic world, not just in the USA but in other nations as well.  Previously unthinkable rhetoric is now acceptable.  Everything from marginalised groups to disability to misogyny to tax evasion; our cultural political norms are almost totally broken.\n\nThese two combined have yielded apathy in those we need to vote most and outrage in those most likely to vote for right-wing parties.\n\n**3.**  **Established voter groups can no longer be predicted**.\n\nFor instance - *The Republican's gains with nonwhites was particularly acute among Hispanic and Latino voters. Democrats' vote margin with the group fell by 26 points, according to the exit poll, to just a 53-percent-to-45-percent margin.* ***Trump's vote share with Latinos looks like it could be the best since George W. Bush's***\u00a0[***44 percent***](https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/how-groups-voted-2004)\u00a0***in 2004. Latino men moved 33 points toward Trump, one of his biggest swings.***  We may have to confront that misogyny plays a real part in US culture.\n\n**4.  The Democratic Party, much like left-wing parties in other Western nations, have almost completely abandoned their historical roots and now can only compete on centre-right policies.**\n\nHistorical left wing initiatives like the New Deal or the NHS in the UK are completely unthinkable.    This serves to only embolden the right-wing.  They can argue on the strength of right-wing ideas versus right-wing *lite* rather than right v left.\n\nThe Risk.\n\nThe tell-tale signs of societal erosion are all around us right now.  Lest anyone be confused; the real risk from Donald Trump is not that he will create internment camps etc.  The USA still has enough checks and balances still remaining.\n\nThe terrifying risk is 4 years of financial deregulation which will lead to an untold financial nuclear bomb the likes of which we cannot even imagine at present.\n\nIf you want an insight into his running of a government then check out Michael Lewis: ***The Fifth Risk***. Terrifying.\n\nAlso, if you want to understand how your neighbour or your family or your friend ended up voting for Trump then check out ***Origins of Totalitarianism*** by Hannah Arendt.  Possibly the most important book of the 20th Century, more so today than ever.  \n\nIf you want to know why regular people would support monstrous policies - check out ***They Thought They Were Free:  Germans 1933-1945***.   Illuminating.",
         "I still cannot believe 15M Democratic voters from 2020 did not show up in 2024.\n\nThis is on you, the apathetic, bewildered, low information non voter. I don't want to hear a peep of a complaint from you the next four years, as our president, Congress and judiciary is all now red. Already I'm getting texts from my teaching friends \"What do you mean Trump wants to eliminate the department of education?\" For instance.\n\nI've said before, Harris was an average candidate, with some pros and some cons, and offering far more in policy for working Americans than what we currently have. If you couldn't find a reason to vote for her over Trump, that's on you. I'm not sure who is this mythical, magical perfect alternative candidate you wanted, but if she had instead run on things like Single Payer and Paid Parental Leave, she still would've lost.",

         "Yes, it is a horrible night for the whole world. The US controls the world's tech and media landscape.

Not that the other are much better, but at least it's our local home grown flavour of corruption.\n\nWe're also in direct line of fire of the russian war and so much hinges for us on being NATO members and working close with the USA.

If you google voting results in the country by county, Trump swept it HARD. \n\nSo the fact is by the view point of the vast majority of US citizens, this was a positive outcome and a great night for the majority of the US. The hard truth is MOST people in this country wanted Trump back along with all the horrible things he stands for.\n\nThat\u2019s the real kicker. That\u2019s the part that hurts more.",

         "  \n\n\nwww.iwm.at\n\n20 Lessons from the 20th Century\n\nAuthor: Timothy Snyder\n\n  \n\n\nAmericans are no wiser than the Europeans who saw democracy yield to fascism, Nazism, or communism. Our one advantage is that we might learn from their experience. Now is a good time to do so. Here are twenty lessons from the twentieth century, adapted to the circumstances of today.\n\n  \n\n\n20 Lessons from the 20th Century\n\n  \n\n\n1. Do not obey in advance. Much of the power of authoritarianism is freely given. In times like these, individuals think ahead about what a more repressive government will want, and then start to do it without being asked. You\u2019ve already done this, haven\u2019t you? Stop. Anticipatory obedience teaches authorities what is possible and accelerates unfreedom.\n\n  \n\n\n2. Defend an institution. Follow the courts or the media, or a court or a newspaper. Do not speak of \u201cour institutions\u201d unless you are making them yours by acting on their behalf. Institutions don\u2019t protect themselves. They go down like dominoes unless each is defended from the beginning.\n\n  \n\n\n3. Recall professional ethics. When the leaders of state set a negative example, professional commitments to just practice become much more important. It is hard to break a rule-of-law state without lawyers, and it is hard to have show trials without judges.\n\n  \n\n\n4. When listening to politicians, distinguish certain words. Look out for the expansive use of \u201cterrorism\u201d and \u201cextremism.\u201d Be alive to the fatal notions of \u201cexception\u201d and \u201cemergency.\u201d Be angry about the treacherous use of patriotic vocabulary.\n\n  \n\n\n5. Be calm when the unthinkable arrives. When the terrorist attack comes, remember that all authoritarians at all times either await or plan such events in order to consolidate power. Think of the Reichstag fire. The sudden disaster that requires the end of the balance of power, the end of opposition parties, and so on, is the oldest trick in the Hitlerian book. Don\u2019t fall for it.\n\n  \n\n\n6. Be kind to our language. Avoid pronouncing the phrases everyone else does. Think up your own way of speaking, even if only to convey that thing you think everyone is saying. (Don\u2019t use the internet before bed. Charge your gadgets away from your bedroom, and read.) What to read? Perhaps \u201cThe Power of the Powerless\u201d by V\u00e1clav Havel, 1984 by George Orwell, The Captive Mind by Czes\u0142aw Milosz, The Rebel by Albert Camus, The Origins of Totalitarianism by Hannah Arendt, or Nothing is True and Everything is Possible by Peter Pomerantsev.\n\n  \n\n\n7. Stand out. Someone has to. It is easy, in words and deeds, to follow along. It can feel strange to do or say something different. But without that unease, there is no freedom. And the moment you set an example, the spell of the status quo is broken, and others will follow.\n\n  \n\n\n8. Believe in truth. To abandon facts is to abandon freedom. If nothing is true, then no one can criticize power, because there is no basis upon which to do so. If nothing is true, then all is spectacle. The biggest wallet pays for the most blinding lights.\n\n  \n\n\n9. Investigate. Figure things out for yourself. Spend more time with long articles. Subsidize investigative journalism by subscribing to print media. Realize that some of what is on your screen is there to harm you. Learn about sites that investigate foreign propaganda pushes.\n\n  \n\n\n10. Practice corporeal politics. Power wants your body softening in your chair and your emotions dissipating on the screen. Get outside. Put your body in unfamiliar places with unfamiliar people. Make new friends and march with them.\n\n  \n\n\n11. Make eye contact and small talk. This is not just polite. It is a way to stay in touch with your surroundings, break down unnecessary social barriers, and come to understand whom you should and should not trust. If we enter a culture of denunciation, you will want to know the psychological landscape of your daily life.\n\n  \n\n\n12. Take responsibility for the face of the world. Notice the swastikas and the other signs of hate. Do not look away and do not get used to them. Remove them yourself and set an example for others to do so.\n\n  \n\n\n13. Hinder the one-party state. The parties that took over states were once something else. They exploited a historical moment to make political life impossible for their rivals. Vote in local and state elections while you can.\n\n  \n\n\n14. Give regularly to good causes, if you can. Pick a charity and set up autopay. Then you will know that you have made a free choice that is supporting civil society helping others doing something good.\n\n  \n\n\n15. Establish a private life. Nastier rulers will use what they know about you to push you around. Scrub your computer of malware. Remember that email is skywriting. Consider using alternative forms of the internet, or simply using it less. Have personal exchanges in person. For the same reason, resolve any legal trouble. Authoritarianism works as a blackmail state, looking for the hook on which to hang you. Try not to have too many hooks.\n\n  \n\n\n16. Learn from others in other countries. Keep up your friendships abroad, or make new friends abroad. The present difficulties here are an element of a general trend. And no country is going to find a solution by itself. Make sure you and your family have passports.\n\n  \n\n\n17. Watch out for the paramilitaries. When the men with guns who have always claimed to be against the system start wearing uniforms and marching around with torches and pictures of a Leader, the end is nigh. When the pro-Leader paramilitary and the official police and military intermingle, the game is over.\n\n  \n\n\n18. Be reflective if you must be armed. If you carry a weapon in public service, God bless you and keep you. But know that evils of the past involved policemen and soldiers finding themselves, one day, doing irregular things. Be ready to say no. (If you do not know what this means, contact the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and ask about training in professional ethics.)\n\n  \n\n\n19. Be as courageous as you can. If none of us is prepared to die for freedom, then all of us will die in unfreedom.\n\n  \n\n\n20. Be a patriot. The incoming president is not. Set a good example of what America means for the generations to come. They will need it.\n\n  \n\n\nTimothy Snyder is the Bird White Housum Professor of History at Yale University and a Permanent Fellow at the IWM.\n\n  \n\n\n\u00a9 Author (2017)\n\n  \n\n\nThis is a short version, but it's also a book by the same name.\n\n  \n\n\nHere's the author in a lecture about the book: https://youtu.be/19IhRaWZUl4?si=ZBTjp4dRCssyfhYR",

Funny thing is that they don't realize it's happening right in front of their faces and they are turning on their own people (dems) when they should be fighting MAGA, they just happened to get indoctrinated. This is truly a historic moment we are living in and many people don't realize how much this will effect the course of this country and historians will be studying the rise and downfall of MAGA likely in 25 years or so.",

         "Just so you\u2019re aware, there are over 7 million votes outstanding. Trump is going to beat his 2020 vote totals by at least a million and Kamala is going to go down by 6-7 million. What\u2019s crazy though is that these are votes that don\u2019t really matter for Kamala. There was record turnout in the places that matter (swing states). Trump just made up a LOT of ground in heavy Dem states and heavy Rep states (Texas and Florida were bigger blowouts for him than NY and Cali were for her and NJ is a legitimate swing state at this point).",
         "It's just a crazy cult. Never seen people idolize a figure like this. Obama was extremely well liked but we never saw people parading with Obama memorabilia, chains, hats, cardboard portraits etc.",

This is achieved by impersonating membership of that same group and astroturfing communities in a procedural and calculated manner using thousands of coordinated accounts.\n\nTrump\u2019s blatant indicators of compromise from the Russian government, in combination with this policy, results in a digital ecosystem without checks or measures toward preventing this interference from occurring again and again. The social media platforms that were leveraged to enable these coordinated efforts of manipulation to take place unrestricted, will, in combination with the lack of any democratic government entity that may have contributed toward the hindrance of this occurring, will have zero ability to prevent this mass interference on the world population from occurring going forward. This will serve to further cement the narrative on any political party or movement those same state entities choose to inject influence over via these online platforms for the foreseeable future.\n\nThere is massive precedent for a quid pro quo in this situation between the party benefiting solely from having the narrative crafted in their favour to influence the population deciding an election en-masse to get them elected; and the benefit to the state entity carrying out the mass interference on that same parties behalf. \n\nWith the guardrails removed and no ability for this to be combatted going forward, the flow of propaganda to an even greater extent and severity than anyone can comprehend, and the manipulation of every online discussion going forward, is inevitable. \n\nThe ignorance of the general population when it comes to their self-perceived ability to know when they are in contact with propaganda, in combination with a tsunami of unfettered manipulation delivered direct, means this may be the most danger democracy worldwide has ever faced. \n\nYour family, friends, colleagues, representatives are all exposed and vulnerable to this messaging. It results in a situation where they find themselves in the crosshairs of the policies of the party they are voting for. Simply due to their focus being on the hate, division and populist soundbites packaged alongside, instead of the policies themselves.\n\nDemocratic governments worldwide need recognise this as the end game, and take action to regulate the ability for these platforms to be leveraged, or they will quickly lose their ability to choose to do so.",

First you subjugate people to an avalanche of BS (Trump 2016-2020) and then you present abstention from politics as self preservation, mental health, etc. Then you can rule unchallenged. This is what Putin did in Russia and is replicating in the US. If you listen to everyday Russians they genuinely think that not caring about what the government decides is good for their litteral health. They say 'I'm not into politics otherwise I would be crazy.', etc.This logic is starting to be deployed in the US, hence the surge in mental health concerns we have had for one year or so. Absentees believe they are sparing themselves from depression and panic, but they have in fact been programmed to let autocrats seize and keep power.",

         "  \n\n\nwww.iwm.at\n\n20 Lessons from the 20th Century\n\nAuthor: Timothy Snyder\n\n  \n\n\nAmericans are no wiser than the Europeans who saw democracy yield to fascism, Nazism, or communism. Our one advantage is that we might learn from their experience. Now is a good time to do so. Here are twenty lessons from the twentieth century, adapted to the circumstances of today.\n\n  \n\n\n20 Lessons from the 20th Century\n\n  \n\n\n1. Do not obey in advance. Much of the power of authoritarianism is freely given. In times like these, individuals think ahead about what a more repressive government will want, and then start to do it without being asked. You\u2019ve already done this, haven\u2019t you? Stop. Anticipatory obedience teaches authorities what is possible and accelerates unfreedom.\n\n  \n\n\n2. Defend an institution. Follow the courts or the media, or a court or a newspaper. Do not speak of \u201cour institutions\u201d unless you are making them yours by acting on their behalf. Institutions don\u2019t protect themselves. They go down like dominoes unless each is defended from the beginning.\n\n  \n\n\n3. Recall professional ethics. When the leaders of state set a negative example, professional commitments to just practice become much more important. It is hard to break a rule-of-law state without lawyers, and it is hard to have show trials without judges.\n\n  \n\n\n4. When listening to politicians, distinguish certain words. Look out for the expansive use of \u201cterrorism\u201d and \u201cextremism.\u201d Be alive to the fatal notions of \u201cexception\u201d and \u201cemergency.\u201d Be angry about the treacherous use of patriotic vocabulary.\n\n  \n\n\n5. Be calm when the unthinkable arrives. When the terrorist attack comes, remember that all authoritarians at all times either await or plan such events in order to consolidate power. Think of the Reichstag fire. The sudden disaster that requires the end of the balance of power, the end of opposition parties, and so on, is the oldest trick in the Hitlerian book. Don\u2019t fall for it.\n\n  \n\n\n6. Be kind to our language. Avoid pronouncing the phrases everyone else does. Think up your own way of speaking, even if only to convey that thing you think everyone is saying. (Don\u2019t use the internet before bed. Charge your gadgets away from your bedroom, and read.) What to read? Perhaps \u201cThe Power of the Powerless\u201d by V\u00e1clav Havel, 1984 by George Orwell, The Captive Mind by Czes\u0142aw Milosz, The Rebel by Albert Camus, The Origins of Totalitarianism by Hannah Arendt, or Nothing is True and Everything is Possible by Peter Pomerantsev.\n\n  \n\n\n7. Stand out. Someone has to. It is easy, in words and deeds, to follow along. It can feel strange to do or say something different. But without that unease, there is no freedom. And the moment you set an example, the spell of the status quo is broken, and others will follow.\n\n  \n\n\n8. Believe in truth. To abandon facts is to abandon freedom. If nothing is true, then no one can criticize power, because there is no basis upon which to do so. If nothing is true, then all is spectacle. The biggest wallet pays for the most blinding lights.\n\n  \n\n\n9. Investigate. Figure things out for yourself. Spend more time with long articles. Subsidize investigative journalism by subscribing to print media. Realize that some of what is on your screen is there to harm you. Learn about sites that investigate foreign propaganda pushes.\n\n  \n\n\n10. Practice corporeal politics. Power wants your body softening in your chair and your emotions dissipating on the screen. Get outside. Put your body in unfamiliar places with unfamiliar people. Make new friends and march with them.\n\n  \n\n\n11. Make eye contact and small talk. This is not just polite. It is a way to stay in touch with your surroundings, break down unnecessary social barriers, and come to understand whom you should and should not trust. If we enter a culture of denunciation, you will want to know the psychological landscape of your daily life.\n\n  \n\n\n12. Take responsibility for the face of the world. Notice the swastikas and the other signs of hate. Do not look away and do not get used to them. Remove them yourself and set an example for others to do so.\n\n  \n\n\n13. Hinder the one-party state. The parties that took over states were once something else. They exploited a historical moment to make political life impossible for their rivals. Vote in local and state elections while you can.\n\n  \n\n\n14. Give regularly to good causes, if you can. Pick a charity and set up autopay. Then you will know that you have made a free choice that is supporting civil society helping others doing something good.\n\n  \n\n\n15. Establish a private life. Nastier rulers will use what they know about you to push you around. Scrub your computer of malware. Remember that email is skywriting. Consider using alternative forms of the internet, or simply using it less. Have personal exchanges in person. For the same reason, resolve any legal trouble. Authoritarianism works as a blackmail state, looking for the hook on which to hang you. Try not to have too many hooks.\n\n  \n\n\n16. Learn from others in other countries. Keep up your friendships abroad, or make new friends abroad. The present difficulties here are an element of a general trend. And no country is going to find a solution by itself. Make sure you and your family have passports.\n\n  \n\n\n17. Watch out for the paramilitaries. When the men with guns who have always claimed to be against the system start wearing uniforms and marching around with torches and pictures of a Leader, the end is nigh. When the pro-Leader paramilitary and the official police and military intermingle, the game is over.\n\n  \n\n\n18. Be reflective if you must be armed. If you carry a weapon in public service, God bless you and keep you. But know that evils of the past involved policemen and soldiers finding themselves, one day, doing irregular things. Be ready to say no. (If you do not know what this means, contact the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and ask about training in professional ethics.)\n\n  \n\n\n19. Be as courageous as you can. If none of us is prepared to die for freedom, then all of us will die in unfreedom.\n\n  \n\n\n20. Be a patriot. The incoming president is not. Set a good example of what America means for the generations to come. They will need it.\n\n  \n\n\nTimothy Snyder is the Bird White Housum Professor of History at Yale University and a Permanent Fellow at the IWM.\n\n  \n\n\n\u00a9 Author (2017)\n\n  \n\n\nThis is a short version, but it's also a book by the same name.\n\n  \n\n\nHere's the author in a lecture about the book: https://youtu.be/19IhRaWZUl4?si=ZBTjp4dRCssyfhYR",
         "Just putting up some excerpts.  Great link btw.  Really nice addition. \n\n>In recent weeks, bombshell reports have confirmed that **a sinister group of Deep State bureaucrats, Silicon Valley tyrants, left-wing activists, and depraved corporate news media have been conspiring to manipulate and silence the American People**. They have collaborated to suppress vital information on everything from elections to public health. **The censorship cartel must be dismantled and destroyed** \u2014 and it must happen immediately.   \n\n\n>\u00a0And I will begin the process of identifying and firing every federal bureaucrat who has engaged in domestic censorship\u2014directly or indirectly\u2014whether they are the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Health and Human Services, the FBI, the DOJ, no matter who they are.  \n\n\n>The federal government should immediately stop funding all non-profits and academic programs that support this authoritarian project. If any U.S. university is discovered to have engaged in censorship activities or election interferences in the past\u2014such as flagging social media content for removal \\[and\\] blacklisting\u2014those universities should lose federal research dollars and federal student loan support for a period of five years, and maybe more",
         "That's not entirely right. It is bad, don't get me wrong. But they don't have 60 senators so no supermajority of major changes there. Anything regarding the core text and amendments of the Constitution is still intact for now as changes to that require the actual states on board too.",
         "They need more state governments before they can rewrite the constitution. But they can essentially ignore it.",

         "I waited in line for 5 hours to vote because the machines had issues. \n\nThe people in line with me were so so low information. These were people willing to wait 5 hours to vote as well and were still relatively clueless.  It was eye opening.",
         "That bit at the end was supposed to be funny, but it wasn't. The fact that all of those interviewed just straight up fucking lied about their intentions to vote, or bluffed their way through their ignorance... \n\nThat's what a lot of people are. They seem nice in person, they seem smart enough, reasonable, but that's only because they don't want to shame themselves. When they're alone, when they think no one's looking, they'll be lazy, selfish, unreliable. \n\nI don't know what the solution is, but I know it doesn't involve changing that about people, because it's impossible. That has always been the case and it will continue to be that way. Maybe the \"bring back shame,\" crowd has a point. It seems to be one of the only things that motivates a lot of people to act responsibly.",
         "I can.  I talked to some people who had zero clue of anything.  They were still voting for Trump because he was \"a successful businessman\" and he will fix everything. \n\nI take no joy in saying I don't care anymore and will observe the crash and burn with knowing eyes.  Its predictable and the US can live with the choice they made because Harris wasn't exactly what they wanted.  \n\nLAMF",
         "People are genuinely motherfucking stupid",
         "WHAT?!?!\n\n\nI was stunned to learn there were people at the polls the day of the election who still had not made up their mind. Like convicted felon rapist or vice president Harris....? Really?!",

         "I remember the first time Trump ran and the customer in front of me at the grocery store was talking to the cashier and trying to hype them up because \"Trump will make sure we can all buy a house for a thousand dollars!! \" I live in LA.\u00a0\n\n\nI wonder if that person voted for Trump the next 2 times as well and is still waiting for their $1000 house. Maybe this time.",

         "This was also how Francoist Spain and the military Junta in Argentina justified themselves: they promised the people that they wouldnt have to concern themselves with politics or politicians ever again.",
         "Mental health challenges have been rising for years. I'm not saying there aren't foreign actors playing a role, but there are real reasons people are struggling right now. Life is stressful, and many, many things are incredibly convenient (entertainment, cheap shopping, etc.), which creates all sorts of issues. One of the things driving that is loneliness and lack of connection (and absolutely, foreign actors driving bullshit on social media have an impact here). So-(copied from another comment):\nPlease, please consider joining a group of like-minded people in your area and starting to do community outreach. Start with relationship and community building, not political information. Do things, and make them fun and interesting and helpful-make them a better alternative to sitting on their phone. Figure out the concrete needs people have and try to meet them. It's hard and it takes intentional effort, but it is possible. Doing this type of thing will eventually start to give you the opportunity to engage them in political discourse and education. But be sure to do your research and know your audience-what they already think, why they think that, and what levers they might be movable on.",
         "I agree Biden should've dropped out sooner.\n\nWho was this magical, mystical candidate who would've galvanized more support?",

         "Yep. It's a problem with the left: they once again fail to appreciate the power of the judiciary, and understand how courts are determined.\n\nPlus they always have poor turnout at the state and local level in mid terms and off year elections.",

         "Worth a mention that even in deep blue states such as New York, Massachusetts, New Jersey, & Connecticut, Trump picked up large voters across all demographics.\n\nWe need to wrestle with an uncomfortable truth. The majority of Americans made the decision to affirmatively vote for Donald Trump. These were not votes against Harris. The country genuinely wanted to deliver Trump a mandate to govern.\n\nThat is a much more unpleasant thought. Frankly, it is a very dark place. But we have to wrestle with that truth. The United States wants a second Trump term.",

Like, I absolutely don't want everyone to vote. I want the people who have some idea of the reality they really live in voting. \n\nI've always thought there should be some incredibly basic ballot question picked by a bipartisan committee each time, like \"Which is more massive, the moon or the sun?\" Or \"Which was built first, the Great Pyramid of Giza, or the Statue of Liberty?\" \n\nIf you answer the question wrong, everything looks normal, but your ballot goes into the shredder when you push the button, rather than into a pile.",

         "The problem is, Dems often \"pitch\" to intelligent, higher income, college educated groups of people. This means Dem voters expect more and use more critical thinking surrounding policy. We also care about \"others\" (marginalized groups) more, it appears our empathy meter is higher. It's not that there are less of us, but many will protest imperfect policy or an imperfect candidate by not voting, or voting for a third party instead \"to send a message.\"\n\nRepublicans \"pitch\" to white people, poor, working class, and lower middle class groups with little education, and sell anger toward \"others.\" Wealthier and more educated Republicans care more about their money than \"others\" so the anger works with them because \"I gots mine.\" This means they expect retribution and want \"a better economy\" at the expense of letting the world burn; they are more simple minded in this way so it's easier to fuck up as long as \"skyrocketing groceries and immigrants\" gets yelled about a lot. They vote consistently because they are consistently angry, so it looks like there are more of them.\n\n\nAlso, there are 161 million registered voters in the US. 72 million came out for Trump and friends which is 2 million less than 2020. This isn't half the country, it's 44%. Which means 56% of the country didn't support Trump enough to either vote for another party or sit out altogether. So less than half of the country wanted this.

Then you get some other Rich celebrity going \"I'm going to make your lives great, everythings going to be perfect, i'm going to do everything and fix everything \" they go \"well at least his stated agenda involves improving my situation\" so they vote for him.

She had to navigate between 'Joe is fine and capable' and 'he dropped out so I'm running'. It was an absolute 'gotcha' situation for Kamala. She wasn't just running against Trump, she was essentially running against her and Biden. Biden needed to not only step out but step down from the presidency, that is the only thing that would have put her in the position to be able to actually compete \n\nIn 4 years Democrats will have a much more competitive campaign, a fear based one.

If Trump attempts to suspend elections, give in fully to Putin, and uses the national guard to shoot innocent civilians, I wonder if the military might attempt to organize an overthrow.\n\nNone of this is a good thing because the US was able to become such a strong nation due to strong civilian control over the military and it sets a horrible precedent.

This is achieved by impersonating membership of that same group and astroturfing communities in a procedural and calculated manner using thousands of coordinated accounts.\n\nTrump\u2019s blatant indicators of compromise from the Russian government, in combination with this policy, results in a digital ecosystem without checks or measures toward preventing this interference from occurring again and again. The social media platforms that were leveraged to enable these coordinated efforts of manipulation to take place unrestricted, will, in combination with the lack of any democratic government entity that may have contributed toward the hindrance of this occurring, will have zero ability to prevent this mass interference on the world population from occurring going forward. This will serve to further cement the narrative on any political party or movement those same state entities choose to inject influence over via these online platforms for the foreseeable future.\n\nThere is massive precedent for a quid pro quo in this situation between the party benefiting solely from having the narrative crafted in their favour to influence the population deciding an election en-masse to get them elected; and the benefit to the state entity carrying out the mass interference on that same parties behalf. \n\nWith the guardrails removed and no ability for this to be combatted going forward, the flow of propaganda to an even greater extent and severity than anyone can comprehend, and the manipulation of every online discussion going forward, is inevitable. \n\nThe ignorance of the general population when it comes to their self-perceived ability to know when they are in contact with propaganda, in combination with a tsunami of unfettered manipulation delivered direct, means this may be the most danger democracy worldwide has ever faced. \n\nYour family, friends, colleagues, representatives are all exposed and vulnerable to this messaging. It results in a situation where they find themselves in the crosshairs of the policies of the party they are voting for. Simply due to their focus being on the hate, division and populist soundbites packaged alongside, instead of the policies themselves.\n\nDemocratic governments worldwide need recognise this as the end game, and take action to regulate the ability for these platforms to be leveraged, or they will quickly lose their ability to choose to do so.",

         "My warning to people protesting in this manner: People have compared Trump to all sorts of dictators, but the closest I think I've seen to what we might get with Trump is Romania's Ceau\u0219escu. \n\nCeau\u0219escu was a communist who leveraged the Orthodox Church to gain power, create a cult of personality, institute a countrywide ban on abortion, and made Romania a worldwide center for child sex trafficking. He mismanaged and looted the treasury leading to massive national debt.\n\nQuoting\n\n> His secret police, the Securitate, was responsible for mass surveillance as well as severe repression and human rights abuses within the country, and controlled the media and press. Ceau\u0219escu's attempts to implement policies that [he hoped] would lead to a significant growth of the population, [instead his nationwide ban on abortion] led to an [increased maternal mortality rate about seven fold], and increased the number of orphans.... Economic mismanagement due to failed oil ventures during the 1970s led to very significant foreign debts for Romania. \n\nThe thing to note about Ceau\u0219escu and other paranoid, cult-leaders is that their goal is to wipe out opposition through police, physical violence, economic, political, media, ... as trump focuses on \"the enemy within\"\n\nExpect: Weaponized law enforcement and military actions in a response to goading you into protests to get you arrested/beaten, exhausting you financially, physically and wiped from the voting rolls. Ask the person who in encouraging you to protest \"and then what?\" and if the answer is \"we'll get noticed\" or \"raise awareness\" then that person is likely fallen for that trick or compromised. Look at Ceau\u0219escu again (or Stalin's/Putin's actions against protesters or the Tienanmen Square massacre, etc.) where there was genuine glee from the unethical leaders to see those opposed to them had made themselves so readily available for identification and destruction. \n\nThe ONLY mass protest that succeeded for Ceau\u0219escu was when things got so bad people couldn't eat. Only that created a nationwide protest with anger sufficient to sway even the military. (also see Arab Spring). The US has about 10-20 years of looting by unethical oligarchs and 2025 Heritage Foundation supporters before we're looking at nationwide famines.\n\nSo whatever you do, once the Trump regime starts, DO NOT PROTEST in the street like this. I know you want to do something, but trump, like Ceau\u0219escu, will use these events to destroy your movement and he's backed by a muskie that has massive amounts of data and tracking ability with starlink. \n\nWhat to do? learn the difference between \"protests of persuasion\" and \"protests of coercion\" Don't go to any \"we're here to peacefully get noticed\" protests of persuasion. Look up how the Selma Voter drive was a method of coercion and winning that lawsuit allowed blacks and supporters to no longer be arrested for loitering when trying to register to vote. It wasn't getting beaten on TV that changed things, it was winning that lawsuit which changed registration rates from close to 0% to close to 100%. \n\nTLDR; Don't do mass peaceful protests of these kinds hoping to convince the corrupt about anything ... run for local boards, offices, and make change happen.",

The upper class is literally a culmination of religious cults. These people are organized, extremely pushy and friends... the time of the right being afraid of the internet has passed.

He won the popular vote by fairly narrow margins. 68 million people think he is *completely* unfit for office, not simply disagree with him.\n\nAnd also Trump legally shouldn't even been allowed to run in the first place, per constitution he should have been disqualified for his involvement in Jan 6th and indeed, several states moved to disqualify him from the ballot and were stopped by a SCOTUS he appointed.\n\nThere's nothing \"legitimate\" about this election result.\n\nAlso Americans have a right to demonstrate and tell the other half of the country that they are wrong for their choice; just like the other half always does every single time too.

         "Categorically untrue, there's some *misinformation* going around about 18 million votes missing from Dems.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/fivethirtyeight/s/XzESWjsnjv\n\nHarris could've matched Bidens 2020 vote total in every single swing state and she still would've lost the election.\n\nI've seen this narrative going around recently saying \"16 million people didn't show up and that's why she lost\" and it's wrong for two reasons.\n\n1, Half of California hasn't even been counted yet. By the time we're done counting, we're going to have much closer vote counts to 2020. I'd assume Trump around 76-77 million and Kamala around 73 million. This would mean about 6-7 million people didn't show up not 18 million.\n\n2. Trump is outperforming Biden 2020 by a pretty significant Margin in swing states, lets look:\n\nWisconsin:\n\n2020 Biden: 1,631,000 votes\n\n2020 Trump: 1,610,000 votes\n\n2024 Trump: 1,697,000 votes.\n\n2024 Harris: 1,668,000 votes.\n\nMichigan:\n\n2020 Biden: 2,800,000 votes\n\n2020 Trump: 2,649,000 votes\n\n2024: Trump: 2,795,000\n\n2024 Harris: 2,714,000\n\nPennsylvania: \n\n2020 Biden: 3,460,000 votes\n\n2020 Trump: 3,378,000 votes.\n\n2024 Trump: 3,473,000 votes\n\n2024: Harris: 3,339,000 votes\n\nNorth Carolina: \n\n2020 Biden: 2,684,000 votes\n\n2020 Trump: 2,759,000 votes\n\n2024 Trump: 2,876,000 votes\n\n2024 Harris: 2,685,000 votes.\n\nGeorgia: \n\n2020 Biden: 2,474,000 votes\n\n2020 Trump: 2,461,000 votes\n\n2024 Trump: 2,653,000 votes\n\n2024 Harris: 2,539,000 votes.\n\n  \nArizona and Nevada still too early to tell, but as you can see, if Trumps support remained completely stagnate from 2020, Harris would've carried 3/7 swing states with a shot to flip Pennsylvania too. Moreover, if she had maintained Bidens vote count in swing states she would've lost most states even harder with the exception of maybe flipping Michigan and Pennsylvania being closer than it was. These appear to be the only states with a genuine argument for apathy/protest votes.\n\nThe turn out is NOT lower where it actually matters. The news articles that said swing states had record turn out were genuinely correct, you were just wrong for thinking it was democrats and not republicans. Almost all the popular vote bleeding comes from solid blue states deciding not to vote and it would not have changed the outcome of this election if they did show up to vote. Can we retire this cope now?",

Surely it can't be that the anomalous election with countless *coincidences* that just so happened to benefit exclusively democrats was in any way tampered with.

         "Yup. That's it. It's almost comforting to me that Trump did not gain many new votes. He won with about the same number of votes he got last time. Even if his voter demographics changed in some alarming ways.\n\nBut the Dems lost because 15 million people who voted 4 years ago decided not to vote this time.",
         "Fucking traitors",
         "Well their choices was between MAGA and a party that spent most of it\u2019s time reaching for Republicans while bragging about getting the Cheney and Romney vote. \n\nAnd then Kamala got less registered Republican votes than Biden did in 2020. And they\u2019ll learn nothing.",
         "I love seeing your ilk refuses to take responsibility. You ran a hate rhetoric filled campaign instead of telling people how you were going to make their lives better.

         "Those complacent complicits fucks",
         "People keep saying that, and maybe it\u2019s true in the national level, but in the swing states voter turnout was extremely high. \n\nPA, MI, NC, and WI having almost identical turnout numbers to 2020. GA is higher. Nevada looks like it\u2019ll be similar and AZ is a little early to tell still. \n\nI keep seeing everyone blaming non-voters but I think that\u2019s a false assumption and will prevent Dems from learning the right lessons here. Sure Philadelphia is a Dem controlled city and turnout there was about 50k fewer than 2020, but I\u2019d be much more concerned about the gains Trump made among basically every group that Dems have traditionally dominated. \n\nThe assumption that \u201cif everyone just voted Kamala would\u2019ve won\u201d just doesn\u2019t work to me and I think it\u2019s going to lead the Democratic Party to **keep** doing this \u201cwe know best, if only the voters would fall in line\u201d crap that led to Hillary in 2016 and not running a primary this time.",

         "Why do people keep proclaiming these numbers like they're final? The actual turnout numbers will not be known until mid/late November. There are \\~10-15M votes still pending mostly in the West.\n\nFor example, your numbers are already outdated. Kamala now has 68M voters while Trump is about to hit 73M - he will surpass his 2020 totals while Kamala will not, but overall turnout will be only marginally below 2020 (by 3-4M max so 1-2%) which was expected.",

         "It would be a perfect way to demoralize anyone left of Trump. Have him win and now they think their fellow citizens have gone full tilt into fascism. No one trusts each other and its fertile ground for a civil war and installation of an authoritarian government. Anyone who questions it are now hypocrites even though there were terroristic threats on Election Day. Why wasn\u2019t that a bigger deal? You\u2019d think it would be normal to grant an extra day of voting at minimum because of that, but it\u2019s done now.\u00a0",

         "If it was a much closer election these things would have had much more effect, but it really wasn't. Yeah, shenanigans happened, but Trump won because more people voted for him and he won the places he needed to win rather comfortably. \n\nThe system isn't good, but he even won the popular vote. \n\nThis result is on Americans.",

         "That\u2019s the spirit. Trump had nearly the exact same amount of support in 2024 and 2020. Democrats had significantly less. Some would call that voter apathy. Some would also call your comment apathetic. Perfect - we are on track to losing again.",

First it was migrants then it was the Chinese (Asians) then it was the Jews. Then they went back to LGBTQ people. \n\nIt's only a matter of time before they get back to my demographic (African American) more than they already do by accusing us of committing 90% of the crime or whatever their statistic is. \n\nHis base will only need an excuse to do what they already wanted. \n\nI'm not advocating for political violence I DONT WANT THIS FIGHT.  But they will BRING it to you, they don't need a reason they want to hurt everyone that's not them. \n\nRight now I'm telling people to prepare, get armed and have an exit strategy ready when things go South because it's not looking good.\n\nIt's not worth dying for a country that never wanted you anyway, you can stick up for people and try to protest , but they are \"talking\" about  shooting protesters now.\n\nThese people want a race war and to cleanse America of everything they think is undesirable.\n\nTrump doesn't care, but if it keeps him in power and happy he will let them do whatever they want. They have a blank check to go buck wild.\n\n\nI feel so sorry for all the immigrants and other's I've seen over the last few days because the fear is all over their face.",

They aren't going to learn any lessons from this, their supporters will just cry and scream about how the voters should back whoever the DNC puts up and never demand better. And when you mention lasting change? Well it's never the right time for it, there is always some emergency threat from the GOP which requires us to accept any candidates put forth.",

         "A lot of Americans seem to be under the impression that the GOP cares about inflation and their food bill, or the cost of their rent.  With all branches of government soon to be under GOP control, Americans will get a painful reminder soon that this is not the case, when their actions once installed will be:  1.  Cut taxes for the billionaires.  2.  Repeal the ACA, with no replacement.  3.  Gut Social Security.  4.  A national abortion ban.  Etc.  \n\nThe GOP does not care about you.  You\u2019ll find out once again.",

They tried to recalibrate the last couple months but it was too little too late.",

There\u2019s no recovering from that no matter how well Democrats do in the next several election cycles for decades.",

The evidence against his character and his intentions is so overwhelming that you could, and people have, written books about it.\n\n\nDoesn\u2019t matter. They don\u2019t care. In fact, our arguments against him make them like him more.\n\n\nSo he\u2019ll just tell them it\u2019s our fault and they\u2019ll believe him.

         "This won't happen.  The economy doesn't really care much outside of major legislation.  The economy is aggressively survival focused too, so it naturally finds ways to optimize and succeed.  You might see 4 years of stagnation due to tariffs. But you won't see a fall.  The only bad part was it was only the Democrat plans that focused on improving consumer buying power.  It was the inky side that laid out a means for consumer growth.  Republicans have nothing like this, nothing that will affect consumer buying strength. But they also aren't currently reducing it.  Tariffs will have an effect, but this might only be a shift to lower sales volume but offset by higher profit dollars per sale. It might be a wash, and we sit stale for 4 full years.",
         "There's no point, Democrats have to do the same thing the GOP does, which is just make people angry.\n\nThe average Trump voter doesn't understand basic concepts of civics, economics, or even how the government functions.  They just know they are mad, and that someone else is to blame, and their guy is the only one who can make them happy.\n\nYou can't win an election on policy when your opponent is running on anger.",
         "Yes, then within two years they\u2019ll lose what little ability to shape a recovery they had due to incessant obstruction from republican legislators and Supreme Court, because they didn\u2019t fix the recession quickly or completely enough.",
         "People aren\u2019t comprehending that democracy is DONE in this country. Trump literally said we\u2019d \u201cnever have to vote again\u201d if he won. He not only won, he is projected to have a quadfecta. We\u2019re so cooked, we\u2019re volcanic ash.",
         "The damage will be done by regulatory capture. The appointments of federal and supreme court judges will determine what America is for the next 40 yrs. This can all easily be done in 2 yrs.",

         "If Biden 6 would tell Gavin to have California secede from the union. 1 min after Biden attacks and then surrenders. Gavin is now king of America and can put in a democracy that really works and can throw the GOP in jail. It's all legal and cool",
         "Too bad we will have to endure all of the policy changes and economic downturn",

         "So when should I cash out so I can buy the dip?",
         "Nah...I've lost faith in my fellow citizens. They chose poorly. Those coming into power will now do what they can to hold onto that power by any means of policy they create.",
         "No. The GOP, media and voters will place all blame on \"divisive and obstruction democrats\". Zero fault will be placed on those in power. Democrats will not will another election in the foreseeable future. Maybe a small majority some day in the house. Senate and president are gone for good.",

         "Will they? The dude bro podcasts that are radicalizing people towards the right were so effective this cycle I'm not sure they will.",
         "That's hoping that a national state of emergency isn't declared indefinitely once the economy tanks.",
         "Nah. The democrats should just hang back. Don\u2019t make the mistake Biden did. Don\u2019t come in and try to fix the mess your predecessor made, only for your predecessor to blame them on you. Let them fix their mess themselves. Let the American people see what they do. \n\nThe republicans did this under Clinton, they did this under Obama, and they did this under Biden. The republicans and their voters made their bed, let them lay in it. I\u2019m tired of arguing, this is clearly what they want.",
         "Democrats will win if they take a look in the mirror and adjust their platform, and not lean on the media to over sensationalize every qualm with the republicans. Trump is he who is. He is a morally empty human. We have learned that people don\u2019t really care that much. They care about policies that impact their lives and their families. They are burnt out on having patronized identity politics shoved down their throats every day.\n\nAlso, Kamala was a weak candidate and I have not heard a strong argument to suggest otherwise. She was not liked in 2020 and dropped out early. Biden brought her along to bolster minority votes. Then he dropped out and she was shoved to the front and the media tried to present her as some savior. She couldn\u2019t elaborate on policy positions and was not good at speaking publicly. \n\nI voted for her, but did not vote with any level of enthusiasm for anything she had to offer.",
         "Right but then we fix it. People get upset its taking too long. They give power back to Republicans who get to govern with the democrat's good economy by making decisions that destroy the economy. Then when the dems get back in, they are held accountable for the lousy republican economy.",
         "No, we won't. They will be convinced it is the dems fault somehow.",
         "Only if the next election is honest. Unfortunately, too many Americans (apparently the author of that article, too) do not understand what it means to live under a dictatorship. Russia has normal election schedule and somehow Putin always wins in a landslide. However, people who oppose him get defenestrated, poisoned, or sent to work camps.\u00a0",
         "Trump will spend like no other. You think 8 trillion last time was bad. Try 10 or 12 trillion this time. He\u2019s a joke and so is his party.",
         "Im just afraid theyll somehow manage to rig the next elections. Either that or because more people start to use social media as their source of news theyll think every negative consequence is Soro's fault or the democrats even though they have no real control. \n\nIf anyone who is more knowledgeable thinks this is unlikely some reassurance would be great because Im literally thinking this is the end, Russian agents( either directly or through bribing our political figures) will be able to infilitrate to the point where we have no legit elections anymore. Im worried we will see journalists go missing the MAGA police departments not doing a thing about it. Just the total downfall of this country for regular people.",
         "I love how the saving grace is that the Dems can take over once the GOP inevitably crashes the economy to one again clean up their mess. Only to then lose to them once things are going well again. At this point, the Dems shouldn\u2019t even want to take over when the economy free falls. If this is what middle America wants then they should have to rely on the GOP to fix any problems they create.",
         "This is exactly what\u2019s going to happen. Trump is gonna fuck this country so hard by midterms in two years dems will sit back and say I told you so. Can\u2019t wait until we can finally flush Trump down the toilet in 4 years.",
         "I'm on state and VA disability. As long as that doesn't get touched I should be able to weather the coming storm. I just hope it gets bad enough fast enough that people are able to slam the brakes before trumps admin fully cuts the brake lines. If it's slow enough then we're just fucked for years.",
         "I read something that basically every incumbent leader in the world lost their most recent election, because people are upset about inflation.  People don't care that it's complicated and it was inescapable because of the pandemic and that some countries have done very well and turning things around, and that companies have been price gauging.  They believe the candidates saying \"It's all their fault and we will fix it!\" and the people in those countries will be simply flabbergasted when many of those economies actually get far worse.",
         "They tank the economy because it makes stock prices drop, then they,who have money, can buy it up for cheap. \n\nIt\u2019s intentional.  The housing crisis, houses were bought by corporations then rented back for $$$. \n\nThey are going to Enron our 401ks and bankrupt social security and privatise Medicare.   They want to bring people out of retirement to work in the fields after they deport the undocumented workers.  The kids can work the slaughterhouses. \n\nBack to the 1800\u2019s.  Like Russia where the population doesn\u2019t have indoor plumbing.",
         "I agree, but, I\u2019m not sure I care anymore. Trump\u2019s economic policies are garbage, but were perceived as better. Whatever, that\u2019s fine. But the fact that so many people will sell out their principles and morals for the promise of money blows my mind. What blows my mind more is that people will vote against their own self interest for money.\n\nTbh, something flipped in me yesterday. My plan has changed to pulling the ladder up behind me and further insulating myself and my family from whatever damage Trump is going to do. I\u2019m still concerned about the climate and body autonomy rights for my kids, but if I have to drive my daughter up to Canada myself for an abortion, I will. I\u2019m gonna be fine, best of luck to GenZ and all the immigrants who just voted to denaturalize and deport their friends and families. May your eggs always be $2 a dozen.",
         "These articles are so fucking stupid\u2026. THERE WILL BE. O MORE ELECTIONS.",
         "By then, it won't matter.",
         "I love the optimism in \u201canother election\u201d fantasy. It\u2019s delusional, but kinda sweet.",
         "I\u2019m a progressive and vote democratic and go to every election large or small. This defeat has really rocked me. I am deleting all my socials except for Reddit and I am not looking at any news on the tv. I would watch msnbc all the time now \u2026..forget it. I am so sad, angry, depressed and numb. My anxiety level is through the roof. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s to come. I know we all can weather it but I don\u2019t want to go through it. \n\nA lot of my democratic friends are telling me this is the time to fight and organize. I don\u2019t have it in me. I don\u2019t feel the same. Hopefully I\u2019ll heal but I\u2019m just burned out.",
         "No. Not happening. We are now in a post truth era. Mainstream media has been largely captured by wealthy nihilists and people are getting news from Facebook, TikTok, and Twitter. Republicans are going to cement their positions by putting voter suppression on steroids and using the dis-info firehoses at their disposal. Before the election, Elon proclaimed that he's looking forward to tanking the economy and it didn't move the needle. At all. We are screwed.",
         "Assuming there will be another election.",
         "Enough. This isn\u2019t tennis where the office just bounces from side to side. The republicans are playing for keeps with project 2025. If the democrats don\u2019t present new, better ideas that actually appeal to people, they\u2019ll lose again.",

         "Bold to assume we\u2019re going to be allowed to have  fair elections again. They won\u2019t give up power.",
         "The issue is, that even if they get back in charge, it will take a while to get things right again.  During which time people will blame them and start cheering for groups like the GoP again.",
         "yes, we know.  The incoming administration is going to lower income taxes, lower corporate taxes and reduce interest rates.  In about 3 years we're going to be complaining about inflation and worrying about recession again.  This will lead to democrats winning in 2028. They'll raise interest rates and tax rates which will calm things down but upset some of our more myopic friends and relatives and they'll blame the whole mess on the current administration that's trying desperately to fix things rather than on the prior administration that created the whole mess to begin with.  wash, rinse, repeat, this has been going on for decades, if not longer.",

         "I don\u2019t think that would work the way you want. Right wing populism is much more of an American instinct than left wing, and always has been. Left wing populism is, at a minimum, instantly viewed with skepticism by most people as something communistic and foreign. Practically speaking, a left wing populism wouldn\u2019t work in our system.\n\nLet\u2019s say AOC runs for president in 2028. Let\u2019s also understand that about $14 billion dollars was \u201cdonated\u201d and spent for the 2024 election across the board. (https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2024-us-election-pac-spending-donations-fec/). The billionaires and millionaires are not going to fund a left wing populist because they, like right wing rich people, like their money and like their power, one of the big reasons Bernie didn\u2019t get the nomination. This is why \u201ccorporate Democrats\u201d dominate. Politics in our system requires dump trucks of money, and that money will never go to the far left. AOC or whoever would never get off the ground because she couldn\u2019t match funding from Trump, Musk, Mellon, Uhlein, etc. in raising enough money to stay relevant. Yes, this is perverse, but that\u2019s the system we have and there isn\u2019t a way around it.\n\nAnd that issue of funding is before any issue of message. And that, too, would not really hit with most people. The average general election voter makes a choice based on their perception of the economy, while not understanding economics. Voters can hold diametrically opposed views, like wanting lower prices, while also wanting tariffs and protectionism and immigration restrictions. Left wing populism would have to overcome both the instinctual fear of anything left wing\u2014 while also overcoming the nonsensical positions of the right\u2014 that usually require more government spending, regulation and size. I don\u2019t see that happening.",

         "I keep saying this, Blue states will be fine, it's the Red States that will have the issues. But no one is listening!\n\nI just want to point out something to a lot of people that might not understand this. While this is the beginning of the next presidency, it is also the end of this storyline. The Republican Party is at a crossroads with itself and it splintering down the middle. One side you have moderate Republican who wants to move the country in a direction of conversation with Democrats and the other side you have the radical Republicans. The party is going to cannibalize itself.\n\nAs for the people that voted for the Republican Nominee, I want to point out a little thing that you might not have thought about. While you are all for deporting migrants, we need to remember that the economy will not stay afloat without those individuals. 1) Migrants make up only 18.6% of the labor jobs in this country. That is not a number that is hurting our workforce. 2) Migrant jobs include working on farms and construction sites as well as mines, factories, food preparation, cleaning, and child care. Here is where Republicans made their mistake.\n\nIf the deportation of migrants happens, the farms, construction sites, factories, mines, food preparation companies, etc. will have few things that will occur:\n\n1. **Getting rid the migrant workers will eventually cause these companies to close.**\u00a0Why? These companies will be getting rid of their work force that is paid off the books. These companies have bult in paying migrants off the books that they would not be able to handle paying the same amount of people on the books. Result: Companies crash, farms in the Red States no longer function, prices of goods produced by the company skyrocket, people can't/won't buy their goods because they are too expensive, local economies crash, the Red States cannot function.\n2. **The companies keep the workers but have to provide them with Green Card Status.**\u00a0Why? They do not want to get rid of their labor but now they have to pay them a livable wage. Result: Green Card Status increases, the migrants become citizens, which means they vote, Red States will see shifts to Blue.\n\nSo what does that mean? Well, Republicans who felt that voting for the Republican Nominee would lower grocery costs, it won't. It will cause them to increase. Coupled with tariffs, getting rid of the CHIPS and Science Act, you're looking at being a lot worse off than you were the last four years.\n\nSo where does this go? The next four years will be an embarrassment, but Republicans will not be voted in as President for a long time after this. No one will be able to inherit the Republican Nominees cult because they have not been able to yet. The Red States population will decline because they will be moving to Blue States to feel protected. This is the end of the Republican Party.\n\nThe important thing to remember is that there are still circuit judges that in place that are Republican that have no problem standing up to the Republican Nominee. Democrats will take the White House back in 2028 and all three branches. In 2026 we will take back the house and senate.",
         "I've heard everyone say blame the DNC for this, but I have to be honest, I'm not buying it. When everyone suddenly decided Biden was too old for the job, I can not wrap my head around the idea that holding a primary before certain states made them lock their candidates was feasible. I think what most likely happened was that party democrats in power heard almost everyone say they didn't want Biden after that debate performance and went with the only alternative they could possibly get to it time. And, to their credit, they actually went with someone who was on the primary ballot instead of pulling a candidate out of thin air, which would have been arguably more undemocratic than at least sticking with someone voter's voted for in the only viable primary.\n\nPut that together with the fact that Kamala ran a decent campaign free of too many major embarrassments, I honestly believe that the only reason it turned out this way is because the pocketbook of the average American is hurting. Bottom line is that people voted in 2020 for a return of pre-covid prices, and while inflation slowed to a more acceptable pace, wages didn't keep up enough for the average American to not feel the burn. If everyone is wondering where the votes disappeared to, I honestly think it's people just dissatisfied with the state of their bank accounts and little else; the simplest explanation is that Americans are hurting and they don't feel heard. (And the majority don't look further to figure out why they are hurting, or what is being done, other than what the people in power tell them). \n\nIf you want to hold onto power, you have to make the people giving you that power happy that they gave it to you; without that, there was just a ton of indifference this time around.",

A lot of those were diphtheria.\n\n\nOr as it used to be called, the strangling angel. Because the thick white-grey membrane that grows in the throat of a child with diphtheria flutters like wings when they try to breathe. It closes a small throat over very quickly. They can't breathe past it. Their breath gets trapped as much as they can't draw one at all. They get these round, puffy necks that close the throat even more until they're breathing through a gurgling straw. Then they're dead.

It's not going to be better under Trump. Inflation will probably hover near where it's at now until his tariffs cause the price of goods to spike \\~20%+ and cuts to the safety net, healthcare and regulations are likely going to chip away from American's pocketbooks from the opposite direction.

The Democrats just haven't been doing that because they still believe in trying to extend everyone the benefit of the doubt, assuming that voters are rational, reasonable creatures, and that it would be \"wrong\" to Svengali them. This is absolutely the wrong approach. When you're fighting an evil Svengali, the only way to fight back is to find a good Svengali.

That means that about 80 million Americans are registered but with no party affiliation.\n\nA total of around 140.5 million votes were cast. So, non party affiliated voters swung this race. So technically, more voters chose Harris than are registered as Democrats. But, more voters, by about 3 and a half million over Harris, voted for Trump. Trump therefore got about 33.5 million non registered voters compared to Harris who got about 19 million non Dem registered votes.\n\nThe swing voters, those fickle independents, are what swung the race.

There was also a fair amount of this one \"being in the bag\" going around with mostly positive news for Harris being reported towards the end, so people said screw it and stayed home. Beyond that, she didn't appeal *at all* to the undecideds and people mostly cared about their grocery bills, which they felt Trump would do a better job at fixing - which I'd say is probably even short-term true as he sacrifices long-term investment in the country to bolster it only during his presidency. My guess is that he's going to dump American oil reserves onto the market to push gas prices down to ridiculous amounts, which will undercut our negotiating power with the middle east long-term (also a win for his Saudi backers).\n\nI ramble, but I mean - this all makes sense as we get to sit here and look at it in retrospect.",

Even the deep blue small northeastern states with a mere million or two voters take forever in counting or at least way longer than they should. It's a lack of resources and inefficient processes set up during a time when elections were much smaller. Really if you want this stuff done more efficiently, elections need more federal standards, or we can all just copy Florida's. Harris was not robbed of 20 million votes. Not every election is going to be a 2020 election. She ran a topsy turvy 107-day campaign, and many Dems protested a candidate they weren't excited for nor picked. People that don't understand how Harris could get her ass kicked have contracted terminally online brain worms which after ravaging the right wing is now working its way through the left. This was a wipeout election for the Dems. It wasn't just Harris that got wrecked. There was no fraud, there was no cheating (by American standards), the Democrats simply did not turn out the vote.",

         "Minimum wage still at $7.25...working full time, no vacation, that is $15,000 a year, before taxes...",
         "This is a recurring historical trend. Right wing socioeconomic policies (laissez-faire capitalism) lead to social dysfunction as more and more people either fall into poverty or fear doing so. The mainstream right can't win elections on these policies any more because they have become unpopular, but rather than change those it either allies or becomes the extremist right (authoritarian and reactionary), going all in on distractions and scapegoating.\n\nThis leaves the social liberals (pro-capitalist but not socially conservative) and the social democrats as the only democratic factions to counter them, but the former block most major re-distributive policies and even the most moderate moves towards a fairer society have to be fought over tooth and nail. This alliance (either as intra-party in a two party or as a coalition in multiparty systems) then fails to do enough to keep their voters on board, disillusionment sets in, voters stay home and the extremist right takes over.\n\nFortunately, it doesn't always completely run through this cycle, but it keeps happening. It has now happened to the USA and the best case scenario is that when those lukewarm Trump supporters are angry at not getting what they wanted out of this \"change\" (and they won't), they will still have the means to vote the government out. If not, then you're stuck until a revolution happens.\n\nArguing that more social democracy would have scared away voters is sort of pointless IMHO, because if that is true then you're doomed anyway. Unless you lower economic inequality through government policy, a descent into reactionary authoritarianism is inevitable because democracy can only work when people are more or less equal and capitalism left to itself will always concentrate wealth and power into ever fewer hands.",

         "Most popular US Senator who basically converted a red state into a blue state, has bipartisan support despite being one of the most progressive members of Congress, and by the end of the 2016 primaries overtook Hillary in national polling including head-to-head matchups against Trump\n.\n... Maybe the DNC should listen to this guy?",
         "Bernie is spot on with this and we can see how the Democratic party has been taking actions that have lead to the current situation we are in:\n\n     In 2016, many within the Democratic Party felt that the primary was unfairly tilted towards Hillary Clinton, who was historically and at the time unpopular. The Republicans, on the other hand, had a competitive primary and seemed to listen to their base.\n\n     During the general election, Trump and the GOP campaigned heavily in the Rust Belt, speaking to the concerns of the working class and promised to address them (even if it was a facade). Meanwhile, the Clinton campaign took these voters for granted, focusing on \u201cHer\u201d messaging and courting higher-income and college educated voters who didn\u2019t typically vote Democratic.\n\n     As the working class began leaving the Democratic Party, feeling ignored, they were often called racist or sexist for supporting Trump\u2014even if they were mainly looking for someone who acknowledged their economic struggles.\n\n     This persisted through Trump\u2019s presidency and into the 2020 election. Trump benefited from a strong economy pre-COVID, which was likely caused by Democratic policies under Obama. However, recency bias often effects the party in power, which helped Trump\u2019s appeal to some.\n\n     In 2020, the Democratic primary again felt tilted, with Biden as the perceived favorite. During the general election, Biden won over upper/middle-class and college educated voters, helped by the pressures around the pandemic. However, the GOP continued gaining support from the working class, minority groups and women.\n\n     Biden inherited a volatile economy due to the pandemic and faced resistance in Congress that limited his ability to pass policy. Those that did pass weren\u2019t seen as helpful or quick enough, so people new frustrated. Many recalled the relatively strong economy under Trump and compared it to their current situation.\n\n     In the 2024 primary, Biden chose to run again rather than passing the torch, and the Democratic Party blocked any real primary competition. While the GOP already knew and supported Trump as their candidate as he remained popular with their base. This was something Biden was struggling with. After a rough debate performance, Biden was replaced, not by any of the 2024 primary candidates, but by Kamala Harris, who had dropped out of the 2020 primary and was already viewed as part of an unpopular administration.\n\n     Harris ran a competitive campaign and tried to reach the working class. Many found her insincere, and the labeling of dissatisfied voters as racist, sexist or fascist continued. Trump gained even more working class support, including from minority groups and women. Harris struggled to motivate both the Democratic base and middle-class voters.\n\nWhile I skipped over some factors between elections (2022 midterms, international events, SCOTUS decisions, etc.), I believe these choices by the Democratic Party have driven voters towards the GOP.\n\nP.S. I believe Bernie was the Democratic Party's answer to the downfall of Neo liberalism, like Trump was for the GOP. The Dems just stopped him and the movement, where the GOP embraced Trump.\n\nTL;DR: The Democratic Party\u2019s strategy of prioritizing college educated and middle class voters has alienated the working class and non college educated voters. When these voters turned to Trump, they were often labeled as racist, sexist or fascist. They are now frustrated, feeling left behind economically and rejected by a party that once claimed to represent them. Additionally, the lack of real primaries (starting with Bernie Sanders) in the last three election cycles has left many Democratic supporters feeling disenfranchised.",

         "Honestly, if you look at the people who thought the economy was bad in 2020, they overwhelming voted for Biden because Trump was the incumbent. Those who believed similarly about the economy in 2024 voted overwhelmingly for Trump, because Harris was seen as the incumbent. Sure, there are other issues that mattered around the edges (LGBTQ, crime, immigration, a woman's right to choose, etc.) but ultimately the exit polls indicate that the economy decided this election.\n\nSo, it really had nothing to do with this \"Kamala wasn't liberal enough\" thing that Bernie and others on the far left on pushing. Biden certainly wasn't more liberal than Kamala and he won 300+ electoral votes just 4 years ago. We haven't suddenly abandoned working class voters during his term.\n\nIf there was one big thing Kamala should have done, it is dramatically distance herself from Biden. But hindsight is 20/20.",

         "A big problem is the same problem that reared its head in 2016: We have forgotten our workers. In the 90s, the Democratic Party embraced the idea of global outsourcing to slash costs and boost corporate profits to the celebration of the monied classes, and they just fully expected the (mostly union, well paid middle class) workers to suck it up and move on to something else. But to what? Service Industry jobs? Because they did the same thing to tech: pack it up, ship it to India and now we have no real pipeline of new and upcoming tech workers since none of us can compete with the value India can provide just like none of us can compete with the value China provides for manufacturing on a pure cost level. But I digress. We had several generations of workers doing basically the same work without requiring intensive education or continuing education. You could be assured that if you kept your nose relatively clean you could get a job at the plant, buy a house, get married, raise some kids, and have a retirement waiting on the other side. And suddenly, you've got the Democratic Party saying \"well, suck it up, buttercup, Mexico and China does it for a third of what you're charging.\" Tech work is much the same (the reality is most tech work does not need a degree and is more akin to assembly line type work. Most of us are not inventing new sorting algorithms, network mesh topographies etc). But then they're not going to get jobs at McDonald's, or folding clothes for minimum wage at Macy's, either. Trump and co have managed to tap into that after decades of \"The democrats have betrayed you to CHYNA\" and these folks believe it. Because it's pretty true. You may wonder why they vote GOP who are even WORSE for these, but I ponder if it's because the GOP didn't actively stab them in the front while smiling at them the way they feel Clinton & Co did. Democrats signed NAFTA into agreement. Jobs immediately fled. Nothing was used to stem the tide, cars still got more expensive, what did we gain? So, when we think about this formerly union-strong demographic full of middle class workers, they feel like the Democrats are full of shit when they come knocking to tell them what's best for them. They've heard it before. For whatever reason, a rich New York narcissist just somehow resonates with them. It makes no sense because if that dude was THEIR boss, they'd probably make it a point to cut his tires every day after work. But somehow, there he is. He's so full of shit that I don't truly believe they don't know; they just think at least we know what he is and what he's going to do. And we don't have to pretend to like trans people or the gays, and all those guys went to college, anyway. Something like that. Anyway, until we can figure out a way to bring manufacturing or an analog back, it's going to be a tough road. You want to replace coal mining jobs with solar panel manufacturing? Instead of talking about it, do it. Build those chip manufacturing plants. Build those steel mills. And yes, while tariffs are going to hurt, I would argue that our prices have been artificially low for decades due to rampant global outsourcing which uses what amounts to slave labor to make sure those prices stay cheap. Tariffs, which everyone says won't work, will at least give some sort of incentive to bring some of that back. It, at least, appears to be doing *something* for these disaffected workers even if it ultimately hurts them. These people gave up their comfortable lives for \"globalism.\" Now they see their taxes going to help immigrants who exist to undercut their own labor in the jobs they managed to find after the plant shutdowns. This feels highly unfair. So, I agree, maybe the democrats have forgotten the working class people and maybe they're absolutely correct in voting for the other guys because, you know what, voting for the democrats who continually fuck them got them exactly nothing. Add in some old-fashioned notions about patriarchy, gender roles, etc, and it was ripe to exploit for the GOP. \n\nI think the Democratic Party is going to have to think hard about being on the RIGHT side of history or being on the WINNING side. Because the GOP is determined to make sure there's no more WINNING to be had once they rig it once and for all. When we're standing at the death camps, it's small consolation saying \"Well, history will prove us right in the end.\"",

Then four years later it was back to the nonstop doom and gloom.

That's enough of a recipe to manufacture their contentedness.\n\nOn the other hand, the result of elections involving Trump has had more to do with pushing turnout than with converting his cultists. Trump didn't get more votes than in 2020 - it looks like he got quite a lot less. It's that the opposition didn't show up, for reasons both strategic and acute. The incumbent dropping out of the race at the last minute and the sitting VP, who was the 9th place finisher in the 2020 primaries, taking over, is never going to be a recipe for driving enthusiasm.\n\nThat plus the obvious observation that Trump is mortal, and much of his support dies out when he does. He is showing signs of advanced dementia already and not much younger than his dad was when he succumbed to it. It's not realistic, I think, for a lightweight like Vance to carry his momentum forward, and no other heir apparent to the MAGA movement has appeared (in no small part because Trump's ego won't allow for it).",
         "This is exactly correct. \n\n> Sanders: \"It should come as no great surprise that a Democratic Party which has abandoned working class people would find that the working class has abandoned them.\"\n\nHe's right, of course, but it didn't happen in a vacuum.\n\nThe Democrats were the party of the working class from 1933 till 1984. They dominated elections for 50 years running on the New Deal until the GOP found the opening it needed during the civil rights movement. That was just the wedge issue the GOP needed to start carving up the working class. Southern Dixiecrats fled into the open arms of the GOP. Right to work laws diminished unions. The GOP increasingly used social wedge issues such as abortion to carve up the Democratic working class base. Walter Mondale (1984) was the last New Deal democrat. \n\nAs things got worse for the working class, the GOP used AM talk radio and Fox News to blame anyone but the GOP politicians the working class was increasingly voting for.\n\nStarved of voters and funding, and no longer needing to appeal to a socially conservative base, the Democratic party pivoted from the New Deal to so-called New Democrats (Clinton) which constructed a coalition from socially liberal but economically conservative wealthy urbanites, plus Black voters who were loyal to Democrats for advancing civil rights, and a traditional but shrinking union working base.\n\nUnder Clinton, the party got too far in bed with corporate America. It would continue to sell out the working class, hoping to make it up for it with more urbanites and voters of color who while not naturally Democrats for social reasons, didn't feel at home in the GOP.\n\nBut the Democrats would continue to hemorrhage white working class voters as it adopted trade, economic, and social policies that benefited capitalists more than they benefited labor.\n\nObama started to turn some of that around, but was saddled with an imploding economy and an Iraq War that he inherited from terrible GOP policies. The Obama administration also didn't address the anger in the Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street movements. \n\nSo we got Trump in 2016.\n\nBiden was a real return to the Democrats' traditional support for pro-labor policies, but it was too little too late. There were obviously issues of age, and many other missteps made by the Democrats.\n\nAnd here we are at Trump v2. People are _angry_. But Trump and the GOP will not bring them the relief they seek. The GOP does not represent labor.

The only way to reach angry, frustrated people (and I said the same thing to people policing BLM activists breaking windows) is to start by contacting the anger and pain. \n\nThat looks like this: your suffering is valid, this situation is super hard that you are in. \n\nThis is what the republicans do effectively, then once the emotions are validated, they blame the wrong people (immigrants, trans people etc) and claim to be able to fix it. \n\nThis is what democrats do: \u201cI don\u2019t understand what the big deal is, here\u2019s a series of facts explaining why your feelings are wrong.\u201d\n\nI mean it\u2019s literally the same dynamic that often gets men in trouble in close relationships. Meeting emotions with intellectual arguments and facts like it\u2019s a high school debate or something.\n\nThat\u2019s just literally not how humans operate at a deep level, like millions of years of evolutionary biology. \n\nBernie Sanders effectively starts by saying \u201cthe economy is rigged against you, your pain is valid\u201d \u2026 then he blames the appropriate parties and puts forward policy after policy to fix it. \n\nDems can\u2019t keep downplaying how bad wealth inequality and affordable housing and cost of living and wage stagnation has been and then point to GDP and jobs numbers like that matters when the quality of jobs available is often not great pay and benefit wise. And quite honestly the Democratic alliance with people like Mark Cuban is out of touch. \n\nIs it bizarre and irrational people fall for Trump\u2019s Everyman con and alliance with Elon Musk? Sure. But it\u2019s also entirely understandable people are angry and fed up with, yes, the death of the American dream, and it\u2019s very human to not be able to think rationally when upset and in the midst of real survival concerns. And if only Trump contacts their anger and creates space for it then he wins. When things reach a point like this, populism will win - and unfortunately if left wing populism of the FDR quality isn\u2019t available, what\u2019s left is right wing populism. \n\nThere is a way to contact and hold space for anger and allow it to transform into optimism but it has to start with contacting and validating the pain.",

Say what you will about Biden, but he had a brand, a support base, and a constituency in 2020. He had a long career in Washington DC and was a known item. Who the hell is Kamala Harris's constituency? Who is her support base? What's her brand? The results of this election seem to show that she didn't have one. Which is unsurprising, given that she was one of the worst performing candidates in the 2020 primary, and had incredibly low favorability ratings throughout Biden's presidency. Trump, if nothing else, has a clear identity as a politician, and a clear support base. To people like me, and most of us on this sub, it's a terrible identity which bodes nothing but ill for the country; but we can't be that surprised that a candidate with a strong support base beat a candidate with none",

The [Taft-Hartley act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taft%E2%80%93Hartley_Act) was passed by republicans AND conservative democrats from the South coming together to override a presidential veto. This act gradually weakened unions over time, meaning that 1) other forms of identity took over to shape voting behavior, 2) democrats eventually had to look beyond just the working class, and 3) the working class fragmented and lost most of its power, so both parties became more pro-business.\n\nYet another example of how slavery was lucrative short term, but ruined this country long-term.\n\nThis is definitely not the bottom.

But I also know that future generations will likely claw back any progress that's made in my lifetime. Round and round we go.\n\nActually, that does not seem to happen.

Now, he did not get the details of the issues correct. Not if you know how these things work - I\u2019m talking about water issues for agriculture and forestry issues in the western states. He definitely does not have a thorough understanding of the situations, and the options he gave to \u201cfix\u201d them were not feasible under current policies.

Businesses actually sharing profits with their employees, strong unions, those things are what let the middle class develop in the first place.  Those things are what created the world where my grandfather could raise 3 kids and have his wife stay at home to raise them with a high school education after he came back from the second World War.\n\nThe billionaires at whose whim the DNC and RNC live and breathe are not going to allow an actual populist to arise who would let us recreate that society.  People might not understand all of the dynamics at play, but I believe they can perceive at some level that the game is rigged, and if you don't offer them a constructive change at some point they are going to choose a destructive one.  \n\nThe good news, if there is any, is that left-wing populism offers actual solutions that scapegoating immigrants and minorities never will.

         "I agree with you, but it's a 50/50 situation - part of why Biden won in 2020 was having genuine name recognition. The Democrats did not have another candidate with \"celebrity\" status.\n\nBut, to lend fairness to your argument, they could have tapped someone long before 2024 to campaign for 2 straight years like Trump did.

All the YouTubers young men watch were suddenly doing videos on \"Democrat cities\" having crime issues and slowly massaging Trump propaganda into their work. And the comedian podcast circle just plain capitulated in exchange for attention."

         "We can blast Democrats. But the fact that 70 million Americans think that Trump is the right voice for the nation, after showing what he is in his first term, is why I feel dejected today. We could be solving our debt, holding the rich accountable, and working to improve conditions for humans everywhere. Instead we will argue if women and browns are people.\u00a0",

         "The losing Presidential candidate ran on lowering prescription prices, limiting price hikes, and tax breaks for small businesses and families. The winner was supported by Elon Musk. The down ballot races mirror a similar deal. Not to mention that red states consistently have a lower standard of living.\u00a0\n\n\nIt's copium to make this about not liking the working class enough. The big cities that consistently vote blue have more working class Americans than the middle of the country but we can't possibly acknowledge what's different between those working class Americans and the GOP voting \"working class\".",
         "Worker unions and their members, like the teamsters, no longer endorse or support or vote for democrats. Trump is anti-union, so good luck to them getting pay raises, etc. And I will lol if they ever go on strike. They voted for him.",

The keep chasing the mythical republican centrist who always votes republican as the actual Republicans move the Overton window to the right. \n\nThe dems worry about every election.  We can just win the battle we have to win the war.  We have to figure out how to win congressional seats in gerrymandering republican districts.  It's just that simple. It's not an option.\n\nA president that promises to try but can't do anything because congress is just not acceptable.  Peoples lives are only so long. We need a dem president that can do stuff.   \n\nUntil then we are just always set up for disappointment.",

         "The \"working man\" has abandoned reality. I'm really fucking sick of this line.",
         "It's always tough when you're the incumbent in a bad economy. The other side has the advantage of saying it's your fault and they'll fix it. Kamala was stuck because if she admits it sucks then she gets the blame for it. If she tries to say it's really not that bad then she looks out of touch. It was really a no-win situation for her.",
         "Harris's policy proposals included raising the minimum wage, massive tax cuts for the middle class, increased protections for unions (the PRO Act and the Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act), huge childcare subsidies for lower income and middle class families, 25K in down payment assistance for first time home buyers, an increase in Pell grants, paid parental leave, a $2,000 annual cap on prescription costs for all Americans, cancellation of medical debt, extending Medicaid coverage for post-partum women, increasing the tax deduction for startup costs for small businesses, making price fixing by corporate landlords illegal, and building three million new affordable housing units in places that are experiencing extra high housing costs.  \n\nThis was a huge, ambitious, and fantastic economic plan for working people.  Anyone who can look at this plan and say she didn't care about the working class is crazy. And the campaign DID promote it.  She talked about this stuff at every stop.  It's not her fault the press doesn't cover it and instead runs stories like \"Is Kamala's laugh annoying?  Let's hear what far right MAGA bros think of it\" instead of, I don't know, talking about her plan to give every parent paid family leave and cap childcare costs at 7% of a family's income.  This was the most radical economic plan ever proposed by a party candidate, EVER.  \n\nSaying she abandoned the working class is disingenuous. It reeks of bad faith. And it's simply not true.",
         "Why does everyone say the Democrats abandon the working class? I want examples beyond that statement. Preferably with comparisons of how Republicans make any effort in the opposite. Border bullshit doesn't count, look at Biden's record with deportations. It basically matched Trumps.\n\nAnd Dems tried to pass a secure border bill but the Republicans blocked it",
         "They had four years to prepare for this election and the best they could do was have Biden pull out 100 days before Election Day. Fucking idiots. If Biden really cared he should have announced from the start that he was only going to do one term and then they could have had a proper nomination and voting cycle.",
         "The working class voters abandoned working class voters. Elon musk and trump are not their friends. But they want to sit at the cool kids table and hate on the other little guys.",
         "The \"we\u2019re the lesser of two evils\u201d approach has been useless for most of the party, with the exception of Biden who only won because he was coming on after a disastrous Trump term and because he\u2019s the single most seasoned and tested politician in the US.\n\nWe need actual good candidates whose entire campaign isn\u2019t hinged on being less bad than the other guy. We need genuine personalities that can get people behind them like Trump does",
         "Bruh she talked about the economy 10x more than Hillary did wtf is this delusional take",
         "I am so tired of people always blaming someone else when things go wrong.  The Democrat as a whole did not have the right message to trigger a win.  To win they must appeal to the majority and that requires that they stop and listen, they obviously did not do that as a party. They ignored major concerns of many, like immigration, high taxes, the affect of inflation on the middle class, etc.\n\nFor the record I am an independent who supported Harris but was not surprised at what happened.",
         "Yep. Fuck neoliberals",
         "Twenty percent of the 2020 dem voted vanished like a fart in the wind.",
         "I firmly believe that the Democratic Party is at fault for allowing Trump to get elected the first time and the resulting fallout made this 2nd term possible. The DNC chose to prioritize their own special interests and agenda to the detriment of their party. As a result, they intentionally impeded Bernie\u2019s nomination and made us pay the price (think back to what happened in California at the time: the people wanted Bernie. The DNC chose Hillary.) They did the same thing this time when they chose to nominate Biden for a 2nd term. It was never about us, it was always about them.\n\nFool me once, shame on me. Fool me twice, f*ck you. Bring back tar and feathers!",

         "I really think what he means is just not running a populist campaign centered on the economy. While Harris did have good policies, it felt more muted and not center stage. Additionally, Harris\u2019 campaign seemed too stuck between saying the economy is good but we need to do more. Inflation seems to be down but it feels like the American dream that was promised doesn\u2019t exist.",
         "Was it disastrous? I felt like everyone was happy about Harris when Biden step down. I\u2019m actually shocked she lost so bad",

         "Americans are ungrateful and uneducated. We got the results of that.",
         "How did she abandon the working class? Like genuinely?",
         "She did a decent job and no real mistakes under extremely difficult circumstances. Americans are done with having a republic and this was directly a vote to end the republic as they would rather elect a fascist criminal than a woman no matter her abilities. It wasnt even close.  This vote effectively removes our status as a republic as Trump was running openly for dictatorship saying so even to friendly media and perhaps even we may see a move to hereditary imperial ambitions and certainly massive nepotism that Americans would absolutely support.  \n\nClearly the Dems had better ground game and funding. Trump phoned a ton of his stuff in. Dem voters failed to vote. Way more than would have made a difference. Dem voters suck. They earned the loss of their republic. Less than R but honestly earned it.",
         "Funny, prior to yesterday, he said she did everything right and had run an amazing campaign. Hmmm.",
         "She did promise a $15 minimum wage, lower taxes in the lower class, first time home buyer assistance, and the child tax care credit (off the top of my head)",

         "Bad headline. Sanders' statement blasted the DNC, not Harris specifically.",
         "That's fair. But the working class that voted FOR Trump had zero intentions of ever voting for Harris. She could say or do nothing that would sway that. Remember the JOBS Act? The Chips Act?",
         "Kamala did have policies for the working class. But I think it could have been delivered in an easier way - don\u2019t say \u2018price gouging\u2019 etc. Say it in the most simple language. \n\nHowever, even if Dems had done that, I think these voters would still have rejected them. They just decided Biden = bad as prices are too high, and it wasn\u2019t under Trump. The people they need to win over aren\u2019t going to remember it was due to Covid or know what inflation means.",
         "She didn\u2019t abandon the working class. Many of Biden\u2019s policies helped the middle class. The Dems are so poor at messaging, and the media environment so biased towards conservatives, that the info doesn\u2019t get through.",
         "This is old man yells at cloud stuff.  Republicans haven\u2019t done anything for the working class.  Sure you can talk about it more but turnout is about star or cult power (in the case of Trump) and optics.  Trump has a much more reliable base and can get voters to believe more of his bullshit than any other candidate.  \n\nThe guy has a history of not paying his workers. Can you imagine if Harris or Biden forgot to pay their landscaper/contractor on time once?  Republicans would gaslight that into Democrats don\u2019t care about the working class.",
         "Kamala had a first time homebuyer plan and a small business plan. \n\nTrump didn't have either. \n\nSaying kamala abandoned the middle class is ridiculous.",
         "While Bernie is right, all of his grievances are only exasperated by the Republican party.  If anyone expects Trump and the Republican party to fix any of those things, I have some land in Florida to sell them.   Republicans will repeal the ACA and we will go back to being denied care for pre-existing conditions or have to pay even more obscene prices for insurance.  Republicans will cut back social security benefits if not get rid of it altogether - they've been itching to do it for years and now they control the House, Senate, and the Presidency.   Those unions that Biden supported and marched with, they can kiss their existences goodbye.  Yes the democratic party has abandoned the working class, but the Republican party actively shits on it and the American people don't seem to care.    We can blame the Democratic party for all its mistakes, but the fault here is with the American people, who are just content being uniformed, misinformed, and creating heroes out of con-men.\n\n\u201cThe forest was shrinking but the trees kept voting for the axe, for the axe was clever and convinced the trees that because his handle was made of wood, he was one of them.\u201d",

         "It wasn't a disastrous campaign. Kamala Harris did the best liberal campaign she could do. The problem is that it **was** a liberal campaign. Liberalism does not appeal to voters anymore. Populism does, and what populism demands is an enemy that people can unite against, whether that be the wealthy or, in Trump's case, an entire racial group. People are angry but don't know what they are angry at or even why. While Harris says there is nothing to be angry at, Trump is telling everyone to be mad at the entire world.",
         "Bernie trying to play captain hindsight and still being wrong is amusing.\n\nDemocrats could give the working class the best years they've ever had and it wouldn't make a difference in their voting habits. Reality isn't apart of the decision making progress for modern voters. Fear, oversimplification, and buying into obvious misinformation is. \n\nThe days of informed voters deciding elections are long gone.  People don't want to say it, but the American public is simply too stupid to have an effective democracy.",
         "What democrats and dnc abandoned was any attempt, anything at all, to counter decades of hardcore right wing propaganda.\u00a0\n\nThe gop has billionaires with huge networks of local radio stations, tv stations, newspapers, social media sites.

         "Yeah, her campaign and the loss are a symptom of a much larger problem within the DNC",
         "I also don\u2019t buy it.  Biden has lent his support to both the longshoremen and Boeing fab unions.   Middle class tax cuts were planned.  Chips act.  Job growth and wage growth are real.   Inflation was going to happen after the pandemic no matter who was in power.  It happened around the world and in most places much worse.  The only thing they missed was trust busting and breaking up too big to fail companies.  Also more incentives for construction of multi family homes.\n\nWhat was the other side offering?  Another decade of trickle down bullshit?  Tariffs?  Deportations?

We just backslide further and further. I consider *myself* progressive, but this has been a bit of a wakeup call, we really gotta stop being such assholes about the democrats not being \"left enough\" for us. They are doing what they are because incrementalism is what actually gets things done and helps us move toward real achievable goals. Based on these election results, the idea of some  revolution that brings about instantaneous widespread change on any longstanding issue is a pipedream. Democrats are what they are because they are forged by the history of what has worked to win for left leaning goals, and ultra-progressivism right now has done nothing but demonstrate itself as counterproductive.",

         "Based on Garland\u2019s performance as AG that doesn\u2019t seem like such a loss but I guess he would\u2019ve been better than Kavanaugh and Barrett",
         "They also most probably stole Kennedy's seat by making him an offer he couldn't refuse related to his son, but that we will never know the full details.",
         "okay I was starting to think i was crazy and that didn't happen since nobody seemed to like care about how terrible it was they did that.",
         "I had been following his career for a couple of years. He was a great choice that the Democratic campaign entirely mismanaged and misutilized. They will probably throw him under the bus after this.",
         "He should have been on Rogan, Theo Von, fuckin Howard Stern. Every fuckin show that appeals to the young or the working class. Instead they neutered him and rolled him around for orchestrated laughs.",
         "I have been saying that forever to liberals... then they started banging on about a BUSH endorsement!\n\nTrump:\n\nFailed half assed election steal. Extra drone strikes. Bad response to natural disasters. Crashed economy (but didnt actually cause it)\n\nBush:\nSuccessful stolen election. The Forever war. Authoritative Surveillance state. Bad response to natural disasters. Crashed economy. \n\nThis cycle convinced me of the lefts culty stupidity. Just because you dont wear merch doesnt mean you havent bought into an alternate reality with mental gymnastics",
         "Kamala was a disaster. We needed to run anti establishment to counter trumps\nAntiestablishment. She had the chance too no really knew who she was. She tied herself to Biden way too much. Her wouldn\u2019t change anything moment was awful. She lost votes by reaching out to republicans and forgetting her base like democrats always do. I supported her and thought she was going to win since Trump ran that bad of a campaign but now I see clearly where it went wrong",
         "Well, yes that too. But stating that bluntly felt like a cop out.",
         "I don't think very many poor trump voters expect to become rich one day. I think they are angry their lives didn't turn out the way they expected and they want someone to blame. There is no satisfying, visceral way to take out their anger on the ultra wealthy, and even if there was it could only end badly. So it's easier to just pretend someone weaker than them is to blame so they have a safe space for being miserable fucks",
         "Here's something I think about a lot though. I work with AI more recently, and the advancements that are rolling out faster than anyone can keep up are staggering. If people think Trump can improve upward mobility they are dead wrong. The economy will continue to get worse for blue collar workers as every industry begins to become automated. We desperately need a solution that insulates workers because things are going to become really difficult in the next decade. Billionaires like Elon who are literally building out the next generation of iRobot having any say in the laws that govern that technology is so absolutely frightening.",
         "I don't feel like I'm being snippy towards anyone, but I am frustrated.  Nearly to the point of apathy.  I do apologize if it came across that way.\n\nI personally need a break from politics.  I'll always vote, but that's going to be all from me.  2016-2021 was just every single damn day something new to be outraged about.  I just can't do that again.  Americans showed us who we are last night.  It's not good for my physical or mental health to try fighting that.  Maybe the younger folks can finally step up, but as a Gen X social democrat, I've always been outnumbered. First by the Boomers, and now by whatever this new thing is.  All I know is that it is not a progressive country.",
         "Oh like the Green New Deal?",
         "January if I understood correctly.",
         "I think we'll be way past niceties such as executive orders or abiding the law by then.\n\nOnce they gut labor protections for unions, there will no longer be any incentive for striking workers to follow the law.  The only way for the government to reign in striking workers will be to send in the National Guard, just like the bad old days.  Our best hope is that Trump fails to achieve most of the goals in Project 2025.",
         "Or hey maybe we'll get another [battle of blair mountain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Blair_Mountain) again. Wouldn't that be fun, drone-striking union workers?",
         "Fear not, Project 2025 also has a strategy of abolishing the USDA and letting farmers self-regulate.  Enjoy your ~~arsenic~~ \"milk\".",
         "Which is insane. I know many people I like, both if we're talking about famous people that I know of, and actual FRIENDS of mine, that I still don't want anywhere *near* politics. \n\nI worry that with the poor funding of schools in some places in the US together with the TikTok-ification of almost everything where people can only take in information in short-form content, I think you guys are boned for some time now. \nI mean, the last point is true for most places in the world, but its with the lack of proper education that it becomes a real problem.",
         "It\u2019s truly embarrassing how effective Trumps WWE (Linda McMahon is his adviser) messaging strategy was. Fucking idiots haven\u2019t yet figured out that they\u2019ve handed absolute power to Bible Thumpers who fully intend to use it.",
         "Absolutely. It should have been round the clock scandal coverage. Really drill it constantly into peoples' heads that he did this, including comparing his constant attacks on Hillary in 2015/16 for mishandling some emails.",
         "We heard more about Harris' stance on fracking than the georgia case or the stolen documents.",
         "Yup. Despite the fact that Biden was able to accomplish quite a bit considering the obstructionism he was facing, the average voter would tell you that he\u2019s done nothing for 4 years. \n\nMeanwhile, aside from gutting corporate regulations and civil liberties, Trump\u2019s only meaningful policy was a tax plan that was designed to make people think they got a tax cut despite it being a net tax increase (unless you\u2019re filthy rich, that is). But ask his supporters, and he gave them world peace, an airtight border, the COVID vaccine, low gas prices, and a trade war victory against China. Doesn\u2019t matter that it\u2019s all lies. And he claims he did all this in spite of the deep state sabotaging him at every step.\n\nDemocrats don\u2019t even need to make up grievances like Trump does, but they want people to be contented with tax credits which won\u2019t endanger corporate interests.",
         "There's a double standard though. Democrats can't do that. When they do, they get accused of \"not knowing what it's really like for the average person.\" When Trump does it, it's fine. \n\nI don't get how people don't understand this. Democrats *cannot* do what Republicans do, especially Trump. Biden stuttered and sounded like he was calling Trump supporters trash and it was a scandal. Trump has been calling everyone who opposes him the enemy within and threatening violence, military action, and arrests, and it's just another day. \n\nIt's not that Democrats just haven't ever thought about messaging, they just know that they can't do the same things.",
         "You don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to take credit for the recovery before ratfucking things out of existence. We did the economic recovery so well, this is why you shouldn\u2019t trust Democrats with economy. A couple years from now, we\u2019ll long for term 1 Trump policies and the issue only being his bad Covid response and injecting bleach. There is no putting out this dumpster fire. The world will go dark very soon.",
         "How do you bring that message to people who only watch right wing news though? How do you engage with them when they refuse to believe what they don't hear in sophisticated echo chambers. It's nice to think the messaging is the problem, but when no one engages with it except for people who already agree with you, you can't feasibly get anything off the ground.",
         "It\u2019s not really about Garland himself, it\u2019s about the Republican Senate\u2019s open insurrection against President Obama and their undermining of our political processes for their own gain.",
         "Yea I posted an article about it on this subreddit when it happened and it got downvoted then about half of the people who commented were insisting that people don\u2019t actually want the electoral college to be eliminated and that it was the right call to make him walk it back cause they didn\u2019t want to offend any potential Republican Harris voters.",
         "Dems are absolutely going to try and say progressives lost them the election when they did it them damned selves",
         "If we do get to have another election I wonder how Walz will do in the primaries.",
         "I didn't think they needed an anti-establishment person, just a true liberal who ran on liberal ideals that were their own. Seeing both sides paint Kamala the Cop as some left winger was hilarious in every commercial. They keep running the same playbook each election. Maybe it's because they keep running against Trump. Maybe it's because they keep hiring guys like Ron Klain to run their campaigns. But there is failure after failure. I have no doubt in my mind Trump wins in 2020 without COVID, but they took that as the sign that they knew what they were doing. Like, come on guys. You're losing over and over again",
         "Yeah, I think a large amount of people in this country are beyond thinking they'll get rich. They're desperate to get by. They are biasing for action because they don't want another 4 years of slow change.",
         "Sounds like someone campaigning on anger towards the wealthy could have a viable way to power.",
         "Another outnumbered Gen X here, who voted in every Presidential election since I turned 18. I was so excited because we *finally* had the numbers to bypass the Boomer vote, but once again, apathy wins. Another progressive that will continue to vote, as usual, ecery election, but I can't be part of the outrage machine anymore. It feels like so much energy is used freaking  out online, but I don't know how many of those same folks show up to actually vote. Your feelings echo mine 100%. I'm tired, boss. \n\nI helped where it mattered most, by aiding Progressive candidates and younger candidates win in the Primary races, down ticket, where it matters most. I just wish the younger generations understood that they're not powerless, despite repeatedly being told so. They have the demographics to change things. Gen X was outnumbered. They're not. And, they have my support.",
         "Hey that's fine too man. Again I get it I really do. Me and I think pretty much everyone that's probably in this thread should probably take a break from it all for a while for our own sake. But I will still care as long as I have family and friends that care, and even beyond that knowing that others have friends and family they care about that will be affected. Know that as alone as you feel, there are still millions out there that feel the same as you and want the same as you. As long as we exist and never truly give up, our ideas will survive and make themselves known in some way or another even as the tides shift and receed in the grand zeitgeist of it all.",
         "Jan 15th if a contract isn\u2019t reached by then. I\u2019m in the industry and the general consensus seems to be if the strike is still on when Trump takes office he\u2019ll intervene ASAP, and it won\u2019t be pretty for the dock workers. \n\nAlso generalizing here but a lot of the Trump support stems from the beliefs Democrats are anti trucking, anti shipping, anti blue collar, etc. Ask drivers and they\u2019ll tell you democrats want to ban trucks, raise tolls, or force them into expensive electric trucks. Ask port workers and they\u2019ll tell you Democrats want to close all the NYC area ports and rebuild them as luxury housing and condos.",
         ">Our best hope is that Trump fails to achieve most of the goals in Project 2025.\n\n\nHow ? \n\nHe has Congress and Senate..\n\n\nBest bet is to invest in Pinkerton when they start union-busting..\n\n\nFuck.",
         "I've said this once and I'll say it again... Construction cares not a single iota about OSHA. Are you fucked if they show up and you've fucked up? Yes. Do they randomly just show up? Not really. In my 20 years in construction as a GC in a major metro city not only have I never dealt with OSHA... I don't know anyone who has either. \n\nWhat keeps companies in check are insurance premiums. If you have a death in the books your insurance premiums will be through the fucking rooooof. No GC wants to pay for that shit. Especially when it's preventable.",
         "A consolation is that they've handed absolute power to Trump, not the bible thumpers. Trump used the redneck Christians for votes. He is no believer.",
         "Wouldn\u2019t matter. These cretins were googling whether Biden was on the ballot the day of the election. We have dramatically underestimated just how ignorant these people are. I knew they were dumb. But you\u2019d figure a certain amount of the most basic information would trickle in, but nope\u2026 I think the only hope is to have porn stars take a break mid coitus and throw in a couple sound bites with basic civics or current events. Just fucking spoon feed these cretins. But even that won\u2019t work because they\u2019re aiming to ban porn. Honestly, I think the only real chance of any real change is another goddamn pandemic. But it\u2019s going to have to involve blood pouring out of people\u2019s eyes before they open them.",
         "A big issue is that effective governance is not flashy or sexy. It's mundane policy decisions there keep things moving and slowly adjusting things to keep everything stable. It doesn't make for interesting reading and it doesn't have a catchy sound bite. Ask a conservative candidate a fix for the economy and they say \"tax cut\" even if in the long run it's going to screw over the working class. As a liberal candidate then it turns into needing to explain the tax code and how increasing taxes on higher brackets will offset a child tax credit that they are proposing so the deficit is not going to balloon.... and now the low information voters glazes over because their knowledge of US tax code is if turbotax says their tax return will be bigger or smaller at tax time.",
         "Yeah, for sure. Democrats have a completely different audience that appeals to completely different things and demand better but on the same note Democrats absolutely can say things that fire up the base.. No one minded one bit when Kamala called Trump unhinged, a nazi or a fascist. In fact, those were probably some of her strongest points in the campaign. Tbh I wish she went heavy on the LOCK HIM UP chants instead of shushing them because that's what the base wanted.",
         "This is a likely scenario..",
         "Well it\u2019s made up of old white racists mostly, so we can\u2019t expect much",
         "While I didn't participate in that one, I am guilty of wanting to pander to flippers. My logic was surely people wouldn't be so short sighted they'd give it to a far-right candidate because the left one is being too centrist, surely not.\n\nI was dead fucking wrong lmfao, the gaza protest votes probably also did a chunk to her when I thought they'd be irrelevant.",
         "Fair something needs to change though. They need to stop running from the base and being cowards. The infuriating thing is she had the chance to. No one knew who she was. Instead she tied herself to Biden way to much and ran for Republicans and away from the base",
         "Yeah, but the democratic elite are so fucking arrogant that they think they'll be fine no matter how many swings it takes to hit their home run."

         "\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 Today, there is no \u201cthey,\u201d only \u201cwe.\u201d We cling to that illusion of division like it\u2019s the last life raft, pretending we\u2019re not all slowly sinking into the same sea of chaos. Aren\u2019t we supposed to be Americans? Or is that just something we slap on the Fourth of July and forget about once the fireworks are over? As author and activist Arundhati Roy put it, \u201cThe war is not over; it is not even beginning; we are all in it.\u201d (Roy, Field Notes on Democracy, 2008). It\u2019s hard to pretend we\u2019re separate when we\u2019re all in the same sinking boat.\n\nAt some point, we sold our future for pocket change\u2014sacrificing any long-term hope for the shallow comfort of a few extra dollars today. A cheaper tank of gas, a little tax break, maybe even a handful of crumbs to make us feel like we\u2019ve won. And yet, most don\u2019t see how deep Project 2025 and those \u201cinnocent\u201d tariffs will cut into their lives. We\u2019ve become a nation so wrapped up in our own smugness, we\u2019re too distracted to notice the slow-motion disaster heading straight for us. As journalist Chris Hedges said, \u201cWe are a society that is on the edge of ruin, and the people are too distracted by the drama to notice.\u201d (Hedges, America: The Farewell Tour, 2018). The kicker? The ones who cheered it all on are going to be the first ones to feel the sting.\n\nIf this is MAGA\u2019s promised land, then sure\u2014bring on those falling prices, the affordable gas, the groceries that magically cost less. But my gut tells me that\u2019s about as likely as pigs flying. The idea that one person can \u201csave the economy\u201d while conveniently ignoring the rest of the world is almost adorable\u2014like watching a toddler believe that closing their eyes means they\u2019re invisible. As economist Joseph Stiglitz aptly noted, \u201cMarkets are global, and the idea that a single nation can somehow insulate itself from global forces is delusional.\u201d (Stiglitz, Globalization and Its Discontents Revisited, 2017).\n\nWhen the reckoning comes, at least we\u2019ll have the privilege of saying, \u201cwe told you so.\u201d Not that it\u2019ll make a difference. I can already hear the chorus of MAGA voices scrambling to point the finger at everyone else, even though they\u2019ve got the Senate, House, Supreme Court, and Presidency locked down. Watching them contort themselves to blame \u201cthe others\u201d when they\u2019re the only ones with their hands on the wheel will be an impressive spectacle\u2014if it weren\u2019t so painfully predictable. As political commentator Thomas Frank observed, \u201cBlaming the elites is a convenient way of not facing the reality that we, as a society, are complicit in this mess.\u201d (Frank, Listen, Liberal, 2016).\n\nThis country\u2019s moral compass is so broken, it\u2019s practically a modern art piece. We\u2019re hanging on by a thread, and any hope of a miraculous comeback feels like a bad joke. Whatever storm is coming, we rolled out the welcome mat. We earned it\u2014every dark, twisted moment of it. As historian Howard Zinn warned, \u201cThe problem is not that we are too few, but that we are too few who are willing to stand up.\u201d (Zinn, A People\u2019s History of the United States, 1980).  \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8",

Yes, that means government isnt responsive to voters on policy No, that isn\u2019t because of mythical liberals.

There were plenty of interviews and pressers during her time in the senate where she just didn't argue convincingly or coherently.  I voted for her out of necessity but honestly, she should never have been the nominee.  The Dems have twice now chosen the nominee through closed channels, alienating much of their voter base.  The DNC should have gotten their shit together long before Biden finally dropped out.  Instead they chose the woman who last dropped out of the primary with not even a percentage point.  \n\n  \nThey will point fingers and blame everything and everyone but the real blame lies with the fact that the DNC is still a bunch of crony capitalists masquerading around as social and fiscal liberals when it suits them.  Their milquetoast left-of-center policies will  NEVER fire up their base.  All they had to do this time was put forward a competent candidate who ran on progressive policies and emphasize what they could do for working class voters.  Instead the message was totally lost while they played centrist.  \n\n  \nBiden had the right idea.  He listened to Bernie Sanders, and while he wasn't going to adopt his policies outright, he did compromise, and supported many of his ideas.  That's how you unify your voterbase.  Biden and Sanders both understand the plight of the working class, while Harris just totally missed the mark.

It boils down to one of two things...too weak and incompetent or theyre in on it\n\nMy fear was the latter. If this happened it was bc it was allowed to happen. So my faith in any of them is gone. If Kamala couldnt do it with all the momentum and Trump looked dead then it will never happen\n\nAmerica spoke. This is who we are. This is who we want to be. So its time to stop acting like this country is so great. We need to accept that we're not and just embrace the fact the Trumps, the Musks, the people who act like cult terrorists for them...its their country now\n\nBeing good and doing the right thing...very noble and all but it ultimately gets you nowhere. Hate and fear get results. Thats just reality\n\nIm not saying we should all turn to the dark side Im just saying prepare to keep losing bc theyve got full control and theres no way to stop them now\n\nThere isnt going to be a next time. Im seeing people say \"well we'll be done with him after this term\". Are you fucking serious? No. No we won't. The entire point was getting him so he'll be in until the day he dies\n\nThere arent going to be any rules for him to follow. No one is going to enforce anything. There wont be another election. Not a real one anyway. This is it. People just had to fuck around and find out\n\nAnd its not just the dems. Plenty on the right are going to realize it too soon enough. Too late. All the red flags and warning signs were futile. Now we got the worst case scenario\n\nTheres not going to be any coming back from this. The old America died on election night 2024. Better brace for the new America. If you want an idea of what its going to be like its exactly what we been saying\n\nTrump and his minions in control of everything with no boundaries. No one to say no. No one to stop them. Its a small club and we aint in it. Some people going to be in for a shock bc they havent been paying attention. Or maybe they dont think its going to affect them.\n\nAll I can say is we collectively failed as a nation and as a species. Keep fighting the good fight? Lol. The fights over. Theres no \"good\" left to fight for. And this country aint worth saving\n\nSo we're going to get what we deserve. All of us. No matter what side youre on. You either voted for this repugnant pieve of shit knowing what hes about or you failed to stop it from happening. It was a test. We all failed. We all lost.\n\nThe silver lining for me is knowing Id rather fail at doing the right thing than succeed at doing the wrong thing. No matter what happens I take comfort in knowing I never bent the knee to Trump and I never will\n\nThat could go badly for me in the near future but Ive made peace with that. Id rather die on my feet than serve on my knees. Im also removing myself from the equation\n\nIm done trying to get through to anyone. This is what they want this is what theyre going to get. Now just sit back and watch it unfold. Any.crying from either side will fall on deaf ears\n\nMay sound selfish but Im going to take care of me and mine and avoid as much of the shit slinging as possible. Gonna be difficult with all the dog shit policies that will get forced through but there will be some cold comfort in seeing his supporters go down as well....shocked that the leopard party ate their faces\n\nSorry if this sounds overly defeatist and pessimistic but this is the truth. Its something we all need to hear and accept bc the narrative of keep fighting and we'll get him next time is a lie. The only thing you can do is prepare and protect yourselves the best you can in the coming days\n\nA lot of people going to have targets on their backs.  You know who you are. Best watch your asses bc they will be coming for you. Im rooting for you but its looking fucking bleak\n\nGood luck to everyone. We're all going to need it",

I think Kamala was probably the best candidate for the moment and ran close to the best campaign possible given the circumstances, but Trump has a deeply authoritarian-leaning core constituency and then won a bunch of economy voters on top of that that would have voted for any Republican candidate on that issue alone.",

In 1914, his diplomatic brinksmanship culminated in Germany's guarantee of military support to Austria-Hungary during the July Crisis which plunged all of Europe into World War I. A lax wartime leader, Wilhelm left virtually all decision-making regarding strategy and organisation of the war effort to the German Supreme Army Command. By August 1916, this broad delegation of power gave rise to a de facto military dictatorship that dominated the country's policies for the rest of the conflict. Despite emerging victorious over Russia and obtaining significant territorial gains in Eastern Europe, Germany was forced to relinquish all its conquests after a decisive defeat on the Western Front in the autumn of 1918.\n\n\n\n>Losing the support of his country's military and many of his subjects, Wilhelm was forced to abdicate during the German Revolution of 1918\u20131919 which converted Germany into an unstable democratic state known as the Weimar Republic. Wilhelm subsequently fled to exile in the Netherlands, where he remained  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm\\_II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_II)",

         "Honestly, I wouldn\u2019t be so sure. All through her campaign she chose to stand for the status quo, refused to criticize or propose change from the current admin, and chose time and time again to toe the line of a highly unpopular Biden cabinet \u2014 one that ultimately pandered to a centrist, neoliberal, hegemonic vision of American liberalism that had been in place, and performing generally poorly and antipathetically, since Obama\u2019s era. \n\nShe did little to alleviate the problems voters felt nervous about (and was often dismissive of them), or champion liberal ideals without tieing them to exclusive conditions (new business owners, new home buyers, and African American crypto investors (like what?) are good groups to support in some sense, but not a sizable base of support or even a great use of time for most voters to be hearing about). She was not great at communicating any loftier ambitions or methods of improving the country or tackling wealth inequality, and improving the economy folks are feeling unsure of.\n\nShe was not elected in a primary, and had very little place at the front of our ticket, especially so when you consider that Joe Biden did not win by a generous margin, and that she was the least popular runner up in the last general election\u2019s primary. The DNC chose for us, and without taking stock of the situation on hand, and we all suffered for it. \n\nTim Walz was a solid choice, and had a higher favorability rating than anyone in the candidate pool, but was further left and far more ambitious with his communication \u2014 which if anything just lays bare how unlikable and misguided the Kamala campaign was. She could have selected Shapiro, a candidate much closer to her centrist beliefs, who could\u2019ve actually voiced broader support for her more center policies (if that was truly the road the DNC wished to take) and pulled that Pennsylvania vote together much better. \n\nShe spent the last days of her campaign trying to push for centrist and a limited pool of non-trumpian republicans, by championing and promoting figures like unpopular Liz Cheney (who lost her last election against a further right Republican) \u2014 and choosing to water down and insult her base promising cabinet positions to republicans in the most divisive era of American politics, rather than champion for needed change and pride in democrat beliefs being a positive force of change.\n\nI guess she did okay with the circumstances, but just objectively hard to envision where DNC thought actual necessary grass roots support could come from with the style and direction of this campaign. Should\u2019ve given the people a primary, however possible, and let people rather than politics decide who is a good candidate.",

And the sentiment seems to be that they  didn\u2019t vote because they didn\u2019t believe in the message. We are going to continue to lose elections if the best messaging we can come up with is \u201cat least I\u2019m not that guy\u201d. People in this country are hurting bad. Grocery bills are going up while stores make record profits. We\u2019re being told we actually have a great economy because the stock market is up, while again prices rise. I\u2019m not saying Trump is going to fix anything (and will most definitely make it all worse), but the messaging was there and people bought it. If dems keep trying to take the high road, and run the same campaign over and over again, we will continue to lose in all three branches.\n\nIt\u2019s not a dems versus republican thing anymore, it\u2019s establishment and status quo versus antiestablishment. And when people feel the status quo isn\u2019t benefiting them, they don\u2019t give a shit about decorum or institutions. Dems spent too much time courting the neocon vote, people that weren\u2019t going to vote for them anyway, and the more left base just fell out. They muzzled Walz for Cheney for Christs sake.\n\nMost voters don\u2019t care if out of touch millionaire pop stars and actors endorse the party, and is probably why a lot of people feel Dems don\u2019t have the electorates best interest at heart.

         "The Democrats are to blame. Not Harris. Not Latinos.\n\nThe economy is good in this moment. But this election was about the Democrats empty promises for decades.\n\nI've been voting Democrat since Mondale in 84. Wages have been stagnating since the 70s. Buying a house is no longer an attainable dream. being able to afford to live alone for many 20 somethings is not affordable. health care and medicine costs are through the roof.\n\nDemocrats have appeased neo-liberalism since Clinton. And Harris appeases AIPAC with her ignoring the plight of Palestinians.\n\nWe can say MAGA is a bunch of racists and misogynists. But that isn't true. The upper middle class voted for trump for financial interests. But it's the Black and Latino working class that sowed this defeat.\n\nThey simply got tired of Democrats reading the same script for the last several decades and finding themselves one minor financial catastrophe from being on the brink of homelessness.\n\nDo I think trump is the answer for the working class? Hell no! But these folks who switched to trump saw that the Democrats weren't the answer and voted for trump out of desperation.\n\nBernie Sanders echoed these concerns with his recent statement: it \"should come as no great surprise that a Democratic Party which has abandoned working class people would find that the working class has abandoned them.\"\n\nI have worked in social services for 30+ years. Entry level salaries in my field have been cut in half during this time. And during this period college tuition, rents, health care and groceries. Other working class jobs have experienced the same decline.\n\nTrump preyed on these insecurities. And while Harris provided concrete solutions for a way forward, the working class no longer trusts the Democrats. Trump played the xenophobic card and said look at trans folks access to  health care. Look at immigrants receiving entitlement such as food stamps, shelter beds and health insurance. \n\nHe played divide and conquer. I am not against these groups receiving support. I have worked in LGBTQ programs. I have worked in homeless shelters. I have walked around the South Bronx giving out syringes and providing care to wounds from injections.\n\nI have also worked as a union organizer in the past.\n\nBut I also see that folks in shelters receive housing vouchers. Single adults get $2,500 City FHEPS vouchers for apartments.  That's several hundred more dollars a month than I can afford. Am I saying that we should claw back these entitlements? No.\n\nBut at the same time as rent takes up a significant portion of my salary, it stings like a  mother fucker to see that the government acknowledges that this is a living wage for the homeless, but they pay working class folks dramatically less than a living wage.\n\nAm I becoming more conservative? No. I am a Social Democrat. I fully support the policies of Senator Sanders, Congresswomen Ocasio-Cortez and Omar.\n\nBut other Democrats see that they are working 40-60 hours a week and barely making ends meet.

They\u2019ll and it on voters and everyone else but themselves, and we\u2019ll be right back here in 4 years. There is a virus in them that won\u2019t leave until they start actually standing behind progressive and leftist ideas, but at the same time connecting with people who just want their lives to be a little easier.

It\u2019s politics man, it\u2019s about how you say it, not what you say. Apparently how Trump says things convinced a lot of people, and we cannot deny that. \n\nWe can sit here and call him dumb, racists, xenophobic.

Is Trump actually going to make their lives easier? Fuck no, but he convinced them that he would. It\u2019s like the Dems didn\u2019t even try to capture that vote, we sat here and called them garbage idiots. Blaming the voters assumes that a majority of the population are sane, reasonable, intelligent people. Anyone that goes outside for 5 seconds or been alive in the last 10 years knows that just isn\u2019t the case. And this election has only proven that further. A billion fucking dollars.

         "Because trump 'won' the primary, right ?",
         "to be fair- trump was already the assumed candidate before any republican primary occurred too. shoot, before he even formally threw his hat in the race. dems just dont have that level of fandom in any candidate.",
         "It\u2019s mind-boggling.  Trump incited an insurrection, took box loads of classified documents to Mar-a-Lago when he left office, was convicted of financial fraud in a criminal court, was convicted of sexual assault in a civil court, and then was elected to be president again.  What\u2019s wrong with people?",
         "and yet he still crushed his opponent, so imagine what the majority of voters think about the alternative",
         "Bro the talking heads on Fox news and YouTube all said \"what is she going to do differently than Biden?\" And it's a fair point. Same party, same cabinet. \n\nYeah I mean y'all got your wish. Just like you did in 2016. Now will you hold these clowns accountable when/if shit goes sideways or rights are stripped away. \n\nIt would be the largest goal post move on earth to blame Democrats if shit doesn't go as plan because they have zero power on the federal level.",
         "Seems sad.",
         "The majority of Americans are not \u201ceducated\u201d in politics. Bringing civics classes into every grade of public school would be a great help. And while the uneducated, especially MAGA, are useful idiots you still need someone smart pulling the strings so yes knowledge is power we are just severely lacking in it. We\u2019d rather just live our lives, barely making enough to make ends meet as long as we have an ok place to live, enough money for shitty food, someone to fuck and a tv to watch. That needs to end, we deserve better but you get out what you put in and the American people put almost no effort into educating themselves about candidates, policy, and down ballot issues. Shame on us, we\u2019re about to get everything we deserve.",

         "They're going to leave us behind.",
         "Yeah, I\u2019m not saying your wrong. And I don\u2019t have the answer. But one thing is clear, the people aren\u2019t buying what establishment democrats are trying to sell them. People not voting isn\u2019t the problem, it\u2019s the symptom. And if they don\u2019t burn it to the ground and come at it a new approach, we will lose again in 2026 and 2028. People want a candidate that will fight for them, a Bernie Sanders, an AOC.",
         "I disagree with that, and I\u2019m as liberal as it gets. Even not voting is a choice, and given the two options, it\u2019s clear which way the country wanted to go. Blame the voters all you want, but non-voting is a symptom,  not the problem. Your analogy buries the lead. It\u2019s not about bad tools, it\u2019s about the wrong tools. A good carpenter doesn\u2019t blame his tools, but a good carpenter isn\u2019t going to use a screwdriver when the task calls for a hammer. But yeah, blame the voters, and then dems in 2028 will wonder they have even less on their side if they don\u2019t completely overhaul their approach.",
         ">Republicans vote no matter what, democrats only vote if they feel inspired. \n\nRepublicans build their brand around inspiring people with their ideas. They also have a media advantage.\n\n\n\nMaybe the democrats are under inspiring people compared to the GOP. My whole life I've seen it as the mainstream wagging s finger at people who want to believe in big bold ideas that aren't bold for a corporate shareholders meeting.\n\nMy whole life I've never seen any inspiring shit from the centrists. The one moment it seemed inspiring was when Bernie was doing his thing.\n\nFact is the Dems I fear would rather loose and stick to their pro business centrism than risk a left wing platform of any sort.\n\nJust think about the new deal. That inspired people. It's been a century and in our generations version of that economic disaster we sell austerity. No wonder the right wing inspired people. The status quo is garbage.",
         "Sure, I absolutely agree that placing blame wholly on one thing or another is not productive. The dems have been making bad decisions for a long time. And to me, where we are today is a direct consequence of the decisions made by the party. The big thing moving forward is: let the dems primary who they want. They need someone that will cater towards populism because that is what is pulling in Trump supporters. People are sick of corporate shills feigning that they have your best interest at heart. People see through that. It\u2019s a big reason why we lost in 2016, and a big reason why we lost in 2024. \n\nPeople got out to vote for Obama, so I don\u2019t want to hear that Dems are incapable of voting. But, you have to give them a reason to vote other than \u201cI\u2019m not that other guy\u201d. And I\u2019m not saying that messaging wasn\u2019t there, but obviously it didn\u2019t connect with voters in the way it was delivered.",
         "I'm talking about the democratic party here. Why do you think being more like republicans will work for you just because it has worked for them? It has lost you the vote. The sooner you realize this, the sooner you can prepare a better tactic and strategy to win.",
         "Yes it's embarrassing but the irony is that people will continue to blame non voters as if there was nothing they could have done differently during their campaign. The same will happen again and again. Blaming non voters does not work, only hurts support.",
         "Have you considered that not everyone gets all their news from the same biased sources as you? Have you considered that the media and democrats have lost credibility with how hyperbolic they have been with their over reporting? Why are you so heavily defending the loss and looking for someone else to blame?\n\nIf people didn't vote they probably aren't as scared as you and it is the fault of the democrats for constantly trying to scare them with fear tactics. I don't think insulting them will have any further effect. If it makes you feel better to do this, then great, but it won't win you anything or gain you any support.",
         "Look throughout history at people rallying together to make the world a better place?  The early labor movement?  The women\u2019s suffrage movement?  The abolitionist movement?  We the people need to get up from our computers and actually put in the work.",
         "Healthcare.  One thing.  Millions of people constantly living paycheck to paycheck.  As much as it hurts to say, the good they have done has not outweighed the despair.  That is why they lost.  Trump offered true change.  Its not a change for the better, but to the uneducated that doesn\u2019t matter.",
         "The base are very different. Democrats can\u2019t behave like Republicans. If a Dem candidate was a convicted felon, failed business owner, sexual predator, and misogynistic asshole, they would never qualify to run. For that reason, we should have had a primary. Dems were arrogant and lost this.",
         "They think he controls the price of bread. That\u2019s what they voted for.",
         "The majority of voters weren\u2019t thinking.  They were conned by a master con artist.  Again.",
         "The majority of voters didn't even vote for him.   161.42 million people are registered out of a population that has 260,046,087 people who are 18 or over, in other words eligible voters.  He garnered 72 million votes compared to Harris' 68 million.  That's a total of 140 million out of 260+ million eligible voters.  He didn't crush his opponent.  Eligible voters in this country are notorious for not voting, whether its by one reason or another.  \n\nSo 72 millions voted for Trump out of 260 million.   That's not the ass kicking you think it is.",
         "Not really the point I was making but sure",

         "And then deal with Russia by themselves? I doubt it.",
         "This, I fully agree with. Bernie Sanders hit the nail on the head from my point of view: people want change, and are angry, and the Democratic Party *still* haven't adapted their platform in 8 years.",
         "You know the realities of our political system I assume? Name another tool in the proverbial box that could accomplish the job of winning the Presidency instead of the Republican Nominee. This Green Party tool? What about this \"Free Palestine\" tool? Oh no those won't do the job. The Democratic Party tool is the only one that could do it.\n\nI've said it once, I've said it a million times, people aren't taking Donald Trump seriously enough. Do you think I get this way after every election loss? Blaming the American people is not my MO, but c'mon this wasn't the election to fuck around, this is going to be horrible, he's beyond unfit and it's bewildering anyone needs especial convincing to do the right thing to protect the nation, and will instead allow it to regress while waiting for the perfect candidate who will benevolently dictate everything you desire.",
         "I agree. DNC regularly pushes unpopular candidates onto voters and the popular ones are repeatedly sidelined unless they step in line. \n\nThe dnc pushed Hillary and Obama pulled a crazy comeback to steal it from her in that primary. \n\nAnd then they pushed her on us again and stole it from Bernie. \n\nAnd then Biden won the next primary (which aligned with what dnc wanted and voters). \n\nThen they pushed Kamala on us but trying to gaslight everyone into thinking Biden was in great shape until the last possible fucking moment where it\u2019s \u201ctoo late to primary\u201d",
         "Dems only had enough control to do something like that for 90 days in the last three decades. They used it to do the most good they possibly could in that very short period of time.\n\nSimply demanding that they make sweeping changes because you\u2019re too dense to learn how the senate works is so cringe. Could not be more wrong if you tried.\n\nYou want Dems to raise wages? Give them actual power instead of barely enough power to stop the GOP.",
         "Yes the loss was because Kamala was a convicted felon, failed business owner, sexual predator, and misogynistic asshole.  \nClearly america hates terrible candidates.",

         "No, I\u2019m talking about going with a democratic candidate that the electorate actually wants. It\u2019s clear that people want a candidate that will fight for them, a Bernie Sanders, an AOC. Clearly the voting base has made it known that they\u2019re sick of candidates like Hilary, Biden, and Harris. Let\u2019s start by actually letting us pick who we want to lead. That hasn\u2019t happened since Obama.",
         "100% correct. Trump is merely giving his people what they want. He\u2019s the symptom not the disease. Dems keep trying to appeal to the rational side of voters, but it just isn\u2019t working. You can\u2019t expect them to keep taking the high ground when they believe it\u2019s not benefitting them. Which is not to say Biden and the dems have not done good. The US doing better with inflation is a direct result of policies they\u2019ve implemented.  But that\u2019s just not how it works in the minds of an average voter. And Biden didn\u2019t help with the messaging either. If I was him I\u2019d be blasting from the rooftops every success he\u2019s had for the American people. But he\u2019s not. Other than the garbage comment, most average people have not even seen Biden in months. Kamala just couldn\u2019t separate herself from him enough to convince people.",
         "Politicians are the people\u2019s servants.  Have YOU forgotten how politics work?  The government is supposed to do what the people want in a democracy.  If the people want livable wages, we are supposed to force them to do it.  Not sit at our desks writing tweets begging for it and then saying oh well when it doesn\u2019t happen.\n\nAbandon the party and have the people rally together.",
         "That is a good way to put it. I\u2019m not sure why my option is getting disliked, but I think it has to do with Dems inability to self reflect.",
         "I never argued your second point.  But your claim comes from a position of misinformation.  Without adding context you add nothing to the discussion.  Voters are registered voters and you cannot argue otherwise because it's a truthful statement.",

         "We will see what happens with that. If the prices go up, they (R) don\u2019t get reelected. Simple as that. \n\nBut if inflation holds steady at 1-2%, well damn, even you\u2019ll be happy \ud83d\ude03",
         "And you will let the country regress if you don't get those candidates delivered to you, even when they straight up don't win or don't even declare. You'll let Trump win if the DNC doesn't tip the scales for people you like, and you need to get over yourself and do what's best for the nation and not your sense of personal moral purity and excitment. This wasn't the election to abstain, it resulted in a terrible outcome and you can't pretend you bear no responsibility",
         "Force them to do it by handing the GOP a supermajority? Awesome guy. You\u2019re doing some real genius work here. Every single comment you\u2019ve made here is MAGA wet dream shit.",

And are you always such a doomer? \n\nAlso I, as in one person, am obviously not capable of educating the electorate alone that why I suggested civics being brought back into schools asap. Beyond that it\u2019s about changing people\u2019s priorities which will not be easy. They\u2019d rather sit in front of a screen all day then get outside and exercise. It\u2019s a massive uphill battle but complaining isn\u2019t a solution that\u2019s for sure. Although I\u2019m very much for shoving every mistake that Trump makes this term into the spotlight. MAGA will never change their mind, fuck em, but the swing voters are very moldable and progressives are dying for a non-establishment candidate.",
         "We'll probably just lose our jobs. Half the components we work with are foreign and assembled here. There's zero capacity to build all these tiny components here. They'll just move all our jobs or shut everything down. Trump can barely read.\n\nEdit: All quiet once you get into the nitty gritty. Trump supporters are surface level.

Please don't be douchebags needlessly.\" And it then just feeds a polarization cycle with both sides taking positions they previously wouldn't have even considered.

Ironically, with all the talk that dems are against freedom of speech, this is the ultimate manifestion of that train of thought. Dems need to realize that some positions must be held aggressively. Sometimes, decisive action must be taken. Not every decision needs consensus to be valid or moral. It is a hard thing to say since to the wrong person, this train of thought can lead to authoritarianism, so it must be done with extreme caution.

         "Few more detailed thoughts on this: \n\n- IANAL but the legality of porn has been brought up in the Supreme Court before where a justice, who's name I forget, used a decency clause. \"I know it when I see it\". And the high courts IIRC have ruled in favor of it. I will say those were under different times though and a republican House, Senate, President, and supreme court could very well think differently. \n\n- Partial Porn bans have already been tried in Utah, Louisiana, and my state Virginia. They want only adults to access the content so any time you go to Pornhub to \"watch a calculus video\" you get this page saying to contact your lawmakers to watch that content. And no, VPN's don't work (at least for Onlyfans). That said, the only sites that seem to be affected are Pornhub and another one, and OnlyFans. There are so many sites that there is no age verification for any of them, just popups and warnings. \n\n- Been listening to a lot of Theo Von lately and he had a guest psychologist on talking about the effects porn has on society. Apparently watching porn also stimulates the same receptors for sex (duh) so people just substitute porn for sex. Theo talked about how he was going dry and hadn't seen porn in over 80 days. I used to be in the porn addiction boat, but once I started to look more into what Theo Von was saying I started to reduce my viewing. I never thought I would say this...but I may go through a \"No Nut November\". And that's something that was totally inconceivable a few months ago. \n\nAt the end of the day, porn is basically two consenting adults being banged. I doubt it's made illegal, although other countries like South Korea seem to be doing fine where the government essentially monitors the internet and prevents you from watching porn.",

I was rooting for Beshear (and I still think he would have been the best choice) but now I'm glad that he didn't get picked. He has loads of potential and this would have messed up his career.

As for those who attended rallies he spewed his violent depravity in their faces and they cheered and ate it up. I guess what I'm trying to say is that in general, the rally goers intentionally chose evil. But for Fox viewers, they seem to have stumbled in the darkness not knowing where they were.

The news does this too, the extent depends on which news sources they watch specifically.\n\nBack to the topic of social media and people being terribly misinformed, (this is all anecdotal btw) I know some people in high up government positions who are seeing colleagues who should know better consuming all kinds of bullshit.

Some instances were people with conditions like diabetes where they eventually put themselves in dangerous situations or even got themselves killed!  My PT\u2019s were saying that while people have shown this behavior before, they have never seen it get this bad until recent years.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s people working in schools dealing with kids who are spewing nonsense as fact consuming tik tok\u2019s or whatever it is they watch.  There\u2019s stories like this everywhere and it\u2019s only getting worse.  I\u2019ve heard it from friends who are working in the education system, and there\u2019s tons of discussions about this online.\n\nThis problem is pretty fucking massive and the trolls and those who wish to push this BS are outnumbering those who aren\u2019t for this.  And I imagine there\u2019s a lot of people like myself who gave up on social media platforms like Facebook which probably helped feed into the problem in the end as the number of bullshitters stays strong while those would try to oppose them have dwindled cause they\u2019ve given up.\u2019",

         "This is great news",
         "Some good news!!!!",
         "Congrats Mr Vindman. What Trump did to you and your brother was despicable. Biden overlooking you and your brother for a good position in his cabinet or in his administration was lower than despicable. It was shameful and unforgivable.  Good luck in your new position!!!!  The people love you!",
         "I have a feeling some of these people are going to end up in front of a brick wall with Liz Cheney.",

         "I mean okay, but if VA locals get a re-count I think everyone deserves one. Just to be safe you know?",
         "Unfortunately we don't need this mental problem to define what the Democratic party is anymore. This is causing us to lose national elections. It may play well in Virginia against a poor Republican candidate, or the Reddit echo chamber, but on the national stage it just looks foolish.  It's time to stand up and stop making the Democrat party kryptonite to parents.  This is exactly the reason why we lost.",
         "but Eugene was also involved giving consul advice on part of it too, no?",
         "A small one. Most of the remaining seats look like they are leaning blue. But I would not get my hopes up just yet.",
         "Basically 50/50\n\nThere's 17 very close races not called, and whoever gets 9 of them will have the House. \n\nThere's a bunch of other races not called, but they're very unlikely to flip, they just can't be called yet due to things like only 50% counted, or Louisiana's weird runoff system.",
         "He can still do quite a bit without the house, but it would be a sigh of relief, since they could block actual LAWs.",
         "He has the Senate. There's a good chance he gets to pick 2 more Scotus judges.",
         "It would give Republicans something to campaign on to win the midterms",
         "When will we find out about the house?",
         "So you are still comfortable with this mental issue continuing to define what the Democrat party is?  I am not.  We keep losing because of this foolishness.  Yesterday should give you a clue. Wake up.",
         "I don't know what mental problem you're referring to but we should always judge a person by the weight of their ideas, their character, and their actions, and not their outward appearance or alternative lifestyles if they are not menacing society.\n\nDiversity is not a bad word, but it is also not deterministic either. It seems shocking, but sometimes people will choose someone who is diverse _because_ they provide a valuable perspective and voice first, and happen to be diverse.\n\nRepresenting all walks of American life (sans criminals) is what both parties should strive to do from the start, as a default. There should not be one party attacking the other from their inability to respect diverse voices and identities. \n\nThat said, there exist real issues in rural America that Dems simply haven't platformed strongly on, because they've been too busy playing defense against regressivism and the erosion of rights. \n\nFor that, ruralites are willing to sacrifice the virtue of diversity if it means they can put bread on the table for another day. You might too if you'd been left to hang as long as they have. \n\nSo Democrats need to look hard at how they connect with those outside the safety of coasts and major metropolitan areas. Somebody needs to roll up their sleeves and start sowing seeds alongside them, delving straight into the core of their issues, to find means to empower ruralites with merits directly attributable to Democratic policies and initiatives. They need to bring ruralites into the national conversation in a way that so far, only Musk and RFK Jr have.\n\nDemocrats need to _live_ the plight of America's small farmers to know best how to make their platform attractive. The first step is breaking up agri-chem monopolies. The second is ensuring better profits through efficiency. The third is making the domestic supply more robust and local-oriented by smacking down market-fixing practices and replacing them with sustainable techniques and access to resource networks.\n\nPaying attention to ruralites doesn't mean giving up the fight for rights and visibility, but it does mean putting their issues in the forefront of our minds as we would any other national security concern.",

One has the democrat up by 13 points with 95% counted, but unless he's over 50%, it'll be a runoff. (there's 4 democrats on the ballot and 1 Republican.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/05/us/elections/results-louisiana-us-house-6.html",
         "Trump has the Senate for two years. The 2026 Senate map will favor Democrats.",
         "He will probably lose the senate in 2026 though. So he has to move fast. 20 Republicans and 13 Democrats will be up next time. And the president's party usually loses senate control.",
         "replacement judges though, but yea, they will be younger so will stick around for decades.",
         "What mental issue are you talking about?",
         "Having a dem-ish house means the \"mental\" issue is at the top, and we can still be competitive with the right people in charge. A total rep control is straight disastrous.",
         "I will accept biggotry and Christianity into my heart. I love compromise! gtfo",
         "We keep losing? Democrats made steady gains from 2018 to 2022. \n\nThis is a cycle\n\nPeople will whine about the horrors of what Trump is doing in the White House again and democrats will suddenly be motivated again.",

Like Maine could be doable and maybe NC especially with what should be a more favorable national environment, but will also have to hold GA and MI which both just went for Trump. Even if you sweep those and Casey somehow wins in PA it's still a red senate with Vance breaking ties, I just don't see any path to flipping the senate in 2 years.",

         "But... but... God works in mysterious ways! /s",
         "I think those three straight wins made Democrats complacent. I honestly am still taken aback at how this didn\u2019t happen in 2022. It was the same issues, inflation and immigration, yet Dems filled any impact the red wave would\u2019ve had, now the red wave finally comes and even hits the Dems where it really hurts. Whereas some people had hope for Blue Texas, now they have to worry about red New York and New Jersey. To be fair, they\u2019re warning signs like when the NJ State Senate leader lost his seat.\u00a0",
         "And we'll fight for you all the same. Congratulations on your win.",
         "Cis means to identify as the gender assigned to you at birth. Trans means to identify as a different gender than that assigned to you at birth.\n\nI know you weren't asking in good faith. But I'll give a little more context. Since I was a child, I knew I should have been born a girl. My brain is that of a woman's in the wrong kind of body, is the simplest way to put it. I didn't get to transition until my mid 20s, but it saved my life because the mismatch was that difficult.\n\nI am trans, but that doesn't mean I'm a bad person. I'm not some gross sex fiend, I don't even like sex! And people attracted to children are obviously gross and need help. Being trans has nothing to do with sex and doesn't make a person a predator.\n\nI just want to be an English teacher, help kids understand literature and this language that I love, and help increase literacy and critical thinking skills. Now my future is uncertain, and I may never get to do my part helping our society grow. It's incredibly sad.",

         "Also, \"learn to compromise and meet the voters where they are\" shit trying to move the Overton window.  I called them out that some issues there is no way to compromise.  Saying you should abandon \"just half\" of a trans person's rights, for instance, just to win more elections.",
         "I did actually ask in good faith as nobody uses cis as a word where I live and never seen it on reddit until now. I am not calling you a bad person either of a sex fiend.",
         "Yup. They've already banned porn in several states, weed will be banned nationwide very soon.",

         "F that... fight",
         "Exactly... f that",
         "I mean...weed is banned nationwide.  It's a Schedule I Controlled substance meaning the federal government literally bans the possession or use of it for any reason outside of extremely regulated academic settings.  The issue is several states have basically just told the federal government they're not going to pursue people for violating that law.  In some jurisdictions it's as crunchy as certain municipalities are declining to pursue criminal charges for weed.",
         "At a minimum if they get senate+house they will take it away from DC.  Because \"states/districts should decide, except when run by black people making decisions we don't like\".",

         "I remember when dems tried to move it to schedule 3 so that Labs could get funding to test with weed, help to better understand how it works and medical uses and whatever.  But that got shot down.  Surprise",
         "The federal government has also decided that marijuana possession isn't an important enough issue to really pursue much. So while it is federally illegal, they're mostly ignoring it. They'll go after groups smuggling it into the country, but for obvious reasons, that's happening a lot less.",
         "That Ken Burns documentary on Prohibition is an amazing watch.  I just finished it and you should check it out.  It talks about what it took to get it as an amendment and the fallout that eventually led to it coming back after 14 years."

They do think women and feminism is why they are sexist and conservative leaning. \n\nThey're still young and have a lot of maturing to do, so I don't think this isn't something they won't grow out of, but it does raise the question of how to prevent young men from developing this mentality in the first place.

Link it wherever you need to.\n\nProject 2025 is a transitional agenda \u201cprepared *by* and *for* conservatives who will be ready on Day One of the next Administration to save our country from the brink of disaster,\u201d according to the [Mandate for Leadership](https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_FULL.pdf) published by the Heritage Foundation. \n\nHeritage Foundation president [Kevin Roberts](https://youtu.be/81IQQytqDwM&t=19m42s) addressed a group called the National Religious Broadcasters at a Presidential Forum in February 2024. At around 19:42, he explains how the conservative think tank will use Project 2025 to help install 20,000 people to go into the next administration. He doesn\u2019t want to take credit, though. He wants that to go to Donald Trump and his Administration. \n\nDespite later claiming to have no idea who is behind Project 2025 [(July, 2024)](https://www.axios.com/2024/07/05/trump-project-2025-heritage-foundation), Trump went on stage to speak about thirty minutes after Kevin Roberts at this event. \n\nTrump\u2019s sudden memory loss is likely due to Kevin Roberts stopping by [Steve Bannon\u2019s podcast](https://youtu.be/BhhulOa97Xg) and saying, quote:\n\n\u201cI just want to encourage you with some substance, we\u2019re in the process of the second American Revolution, which will remain as bloodless as the left allows it to be.\u201d\n\nEven though he now claims he has no idea who they are, Trump enacted [60% of the policies](https://www.heritage.org/impact/trump-administration-embraces-heritage-foundation-policy-recommendations) suggested to him by the Heritage Foundation in 2018. \n\nMany of the architects of Project 2025 [served in the Trump administration](https://apnews.com/article/trump-project-2025-biden-9d372469033d23e1e3aef5cf0470a2e6#). Additionally, [Trump\u2019s Super PAC has been funding ads](https://x.com/ammarmufasa/status/1809252191837753590) for Project 2025. \n\nThe Mandate for Leadership, despite being almost 1000 pages, doesn\u2019t really detail *how* the Administration would accomplish any change within the government. To understand the actions members of the Administration would be taking, we have to look to the [policy proposals](https://www.heritage.org/budget/pages/policy-proposals.html) by the Heritage Foundation and authors of the Project 2025 framework. \n\nFocusing on veterans and servicemembers, here are some key proposals that should have your attention. \n\n[Privatize TRICARE](https://www.heritage.org/budget/pages/recommendations/1.050.93.html)\n\n[Replace 80,000 troops with civilians](https://www.heritage.org/budget/pages/recommendations/1.050.95.html)\n\n[Reduce the Basic Allowance for Housing by 66%](https://www.heritage.org/budget/pages/recommendations/1.050.91.html)\n\n[Stop DoD research into breast, ovarian, and prostate cancer, epilepsy, autism, and other medical conditions](https://www.heritage.org/budget/pages/recommendations/1.050.98.html)\n\n[Reduce commissary and exchange subsidy by 20%, and combine commissary and exchange functions](https://www.heritage.org/budget/pages/recommendations/1.050.97.html)\n\n[End enrollment in medical care for Priority Groups 7 & 8](https://www.heritage.org/budget/pages/recommendations/1.700.35.html)\n\n[Exclude Veterans from receiving disability due to arteriosclerotic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Crohn\u2019s disease, hemorrhoids, multiple sclerosis, osteoarthritis, and uterine fibroids](https://www.heritage.org/budget/pages/recommendations/2.700.24.html)\n\n[Limit initial application for service related disability to within 10 years following end of active service](https://www.heritage.org/budget/pages/recommendations/2.700.23.html)\n\n[Eliminate concurrent receipt of retirement pay and disability compensation](https://www.heritage.org/budget/pages/recommendations/2.600.22.html)\n\nBottom line: There\u2019s no guarantee any of these or similar policies will be codified into law during the second Trump Administration. But we know he\u2019s worked with these people to enact similar policy before. Buckle in, folks. Shit\u2019s gonna get weird.",

         "Let\u2019s say Republicans in the house have a 1-2 vote majority. it will be difficult to get 100% the conference on board with everything the fringe wants. If you look at these local races they are tight and each district these folks are in they have to answer to things. They struggled with getting broad support for more draconian cuts in his first term including the ACA.\n\nIn the Senate, unless they get rid of the filibuster, they will need to have a 60 vote threshold for their more draconian bills. Also a small majority in the Senate could lead to some folks not going along with everything because they also may be in purple states. If they get rid of the filibuster they open the door to democrats retaking control and getting things passed in the future with no way to block them.\n\nThis brings us to reconciliation. You can get around the filibuster through reconciliation. A reconciliation bill has to be something regarding revenue, spending, or debt limit. That\u2019s all they can do. This is how they got the tax cut bill passed. It\u2019s how Obama passed the ACA. It\u2019s how the inflation reduction act was passed. They can cut spending and taxes through reconciliation but then you have to get close to 100% of your conference on board with voting on a bill because democrats likely won\u2019t vote for some of the spending cuts they want to put through. There will likely be spending cuts because Trumps tax plan would add significant to the debt but what those look like will need broad support. Veterans benefits I think would be toward the bottom of that list. It doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t happen but it\u2019s less likely versus potentially some other entitlement programs could have some adjustments to it. \n\nOverall I am not saying there won\u2019t be cuts to our government budget, but significant cuts in the range of what Elon Musk was talking about I don\u2019t expect those.\n\nAlso reconciliation there is a limit on the amount of bills per year they can do and most of the time you spend a lot of political capital and only get 1 per year maybe.",

         "I agree, but the fact trump isn't going to give you education benefits, a pension or federal healthcare. federal employees and dependants get those, and he's talking about slashing them and cutting those benefits, which effects millions of people.",

         "He\u2019s already cut their benefits. Why do you think he won\u2019t do it again?\n\nTrump doesn\u2019t care about wether something is politically stupid his knee benders think everything he does is great",
         "My dad and my brother have the same take, fair enough, thanks for your input.",
         "Assuming Musk doesn't get a free hand in all this stuff, they will do things the Grover Nordqvist way: don't just cut things entirely but pump up the requirements for receiving any benefits so only a select few actually get anything. Until it collapses entirely. \n\nThen blame Dems for making things so complicated.",
         "Trump has stated his desire to use the military to quash protest. We'll see.",
         "yes of course, trumps hates the military especially ones that have been killed or wounded serving.",
         "Oh, sorry, my bad. :) So used to sarcasm.\n\nAnyway, since GOP holds both majorities, they can and (as you will see) will pass any and every law that Trump, or his cronies, think they should.  They will do it with regularity and with whiplash-inducing speed.  You can look forward to that.\n\nAs for the law's content, one thing I might say: understand that there are no limits.  None whatsoever.  Whatever you think is \"a step too far\" isn't even remotely beginning to even become a step too far.  There is no bottom to the barrel.",

         "Yes I believe so. Now there is a VA short fall according to budget and Mcarthy had suggested cuts in the past. I\u2019m sure there will be suggested cuts. A lot of districts in the house have VA facilities and so I think it would be difficult to have significant cuts through that could harm veterans. It\u2019s not zero chance but I think lower than some other priorities.",

         "I don\u2019t know how veterans benefits in the US work and who processes them, but there is a simple trick they\u2019ll 100% use. You can always just limit funding towards the administrative side of things. \n\nIn addition to bumping up requirements they\u2019ll also fire some of the people who handle requests etc. Sooner or later applications will start to pile up and take months to process. People will be overworked and quit. They won\u2019t hire enough new people.\n\nReducing the funding for clerks will probably even be a positive headline for them, while cutting programs would be a negative headline for them. The outcome is the same though.",
         "AFAIK even if they did change rating criteria to do what you say it would require a grandfathering of previous claimants. Which would kind of defeat the purpose, since spending would be largely identical to what it was. They could try to set in motion a long term save in spending but I would imagine future presidents would overturn the policy if they disagree with it.",
         "Can I use the \"Russia experiences a coup d'etat \"\nOn my 2025 Bing card for America?",
         "Thanks for your perspective. We'll see what comes of it all. As far as this matter is strictly concerned, we can only hope the VBA is treated with fairness for those already engrossed in it and future veterans are treated with a degree of fairness that would compensate them justly for lifelong injuries.",
         "to support this (couldn't find much with a quick search):\n\n>Broadening the survey yielded results that fly in the face of the conventional view. The Army, it turns out, is hardly a bastion of right-wing thought.\n\n>It is true that the upper echelons of the military tilt right. My own [Dempsey\u2019s] research confirmed that about two-thirds of majors and higher-ranking officers identify as conservative, as previous studies found. But that tilt becomes far less pronounced when you expand the pool of respondents. That is because only 32 percent of the Army\u2019s enlisted soldiers consider themselves conservative, while 23 percent identify as liberal and the remaining 45 percent are self-described moderates. These numbers closely mirror the ideological predilections of the civilian population\n\nhttps://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-soldiers-really-vote/\n\nand that's in the Army -- at least from what I saw, I'd expect to see higher numbers leaning to the left in the Navy and Air Force",
         "What do you make of the argument that those receiving disability benefits at the highest rates are incapable of gainful employment and rely on VA benefits to survive?",
         "You do realise Tesla wouldn\u2019t exist without government subsidies (ie handouts) don\u2019t you?\n\nhttps://subsidytracker.goodjobsfirst.org/parent/tesla-inc\n\nYup you read that right close to 3 billion mostly from the Californian government",

         "I understand that it sounds panicked and alarmist.  But I've witnessed first hand how these things can go, and usually, they go like that.\n\nAs for the veterans, I would much rather their benefits not be cut, of course; but I also want there to be less veterans, not in a \"they should die\" sort of way but \"less military engagements\" sort of way.",
         "Just like Trump, I think they\u2019re losers and suckers for even enlisting to fight since there\u2019s nothing in it for them",
         "Is it in your opinion that veterans ought to get nothing for service? I want to make sure I'm not misunderstanding you, and if that is your opinion that's alright for you to have that opinion. I'll go on record to say I respectfully disagree if that's your stance, but I'm happy to listen to your reasoning.",
         "You dont seem to get where people are coming from. Veterns overwhelmingly voted for Trump who is gonna fuck over lots of groups, not just veterns, so you should be able to understand where the schadenfreude comes from. I am not American and I am in favour of helping veterans but you can't expect the left the make a great stand for your rights/benefits when that same group votes to take that rights and benefits away from others.",
         "I understand the dissonance - I'm mainly seeking perspective. Is it weird that at risk parties voted for the party that would put their benefits at risk? Yeah. The perspective I'm seeking is the general consensus of, \"Should veterans be worried about their benefits?\".\n\nObviously I've come to my own conclusion on this but a healthy conversation is always nice to have."

         "As a person who heads a quality dept in FDA-regulated industries, it\u2019s up to me and others in similar roles to hold the line to protect consumer safety.  It\u2019s not much, but it\u2019s what I can do. \n\nFor those that care, organic, Kosher, and Halal certifiers are not going to be affected as quickly as FDA. There is still oversight from those certifying bodies. There is additional layer of protection for those certified products.  \n\nBe safe out there, yall.\n\nETA a comment i posted as a reply but may help others:\n\nSo for Organic, Halal, and Kosher, to get the mark you have to comply with a set of standards that mirror the GMPs (Code of Federal regulations applicable to each industry). They require documentation, traceability of ingredients, and due to the requirement for manufacturers of ingredients to also be certified (organic specifically), site visits are also performed.\n\nFor organic, for example, once a year they audit our facilities and look at cleanliness and associated records. Making sure we have a recall plan, a food safety plan, that we are getting certificates of food safe conformity for packaging materials. They have to know WHO we are buying from, and they have to know that THAT vendor is being visited annually.\n\nAnd that\u2019s just organic. With Kosher it\u2019s the same deal, plus monthly random inspections. So a kosher organic product has 2 groups making sure I don\u2019t use sawdust as a food filler.\n\nDespite paying the certifier a fee, they are not easily swayed. Their reputation is on the line as a certifying body, so looking the other way on a requirement can be business suicide.\n\nYou know how often fda inspects food, cosmetic, or supplement facilities? Not annually, that\u2019s for sure. They rely on USDA to do the heavy lifting and are only CFR-required to routinely visit supplement manufacturers.\n\nThis is a brief rundown, let me know if you\u2019ve got questions.

         "Welcome back to the bad old days of 1905 when you're just as likely to die from a a simple bacterial infectionan as from poison in the food that you bought from your local store.\n\nBefore the establishment of the FDA in 1906, the food supply in the United States was largely unregulated, leading to widespread unsafe practices and contamination. Key issues included:\n\n1. Contaminants and Adulteration: Food producers often added harmful substances to increase weight, improve color, or extend shelf life. Common examples included adding lead-based dyes to candy, formaldehyde to milk, and borax as a preservative in meat. These chemicals were often toxic and had severe health effects on consumers.\n\n\n2. Spoilage and Lack of Sanitation: Without federal oversight, food production often lacked sanitary standards. Meatpacking plants, for example, were notoriously unhygienic, as famously described in Upton Sinclair\u2019s 1906 novel The Jungle. Food would often be contaminated with dirt, animal waste, and diseased meat, increasing the risk of illnesses.\n\n\n3. Mislabeling and Fraud: Many food products were mislabeled or falsely marketed. Companies made exaggerated or entirely false claims about their products, which misled consumers. Some products labeled as \u201cpure\u201d or \u201cnatural\u201d were anything but, and harmful additives were rarely disclosed.\n\n\n4. Milk and Meat Safety: Milk was often diluted with water and contaminated with bacteria due to improper handling and storage. Similarly, meat products were sometimes sourced from sick or diseased animals, contributing to outbreaks of foodborne illnesses.\n\n\n5. Absence of Food Standards: There were no uniform standards or labeling requirements, so consumers had little way to know the quality or safety of the products they bought.\n\n\n\nThese dangerous practices led to a demand for regulation, culminating in the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906, which later evolved into the FDA. The Act established basic standards, banned certain harmful additives, and introduced labeling requirements to protect public health and trust in the food supply.",

For some they see this as a strength, for others they see this as a travesty of justice, but at the end of the day it is what he does. \n\nWhat happened is that Donald Trump did something terrible with documents and secrets But because we pay fealty to the idea of justice in this country, he had to go through the system just like everybody else. A system that he is a master of manipulating and stalling, he ran this election like he was going to die if he lost because if he did lose then he would lose these cases and most likely die in prison. He won and thus all his tactics, manipulations, and abuse of the system paid off. \n\nEvery country has these issues, this is just the first time it's been something so massively major in the US.

The main fact of American politics in the post-Obama era is that an ever larger majority of Americans are angry at the status quo and open to anti-system politics.*\n\nYes.

But instead, they told us to ignore what our eyes and ears were telling us, that the economy was actually perfect, and anyone claiming otherwise was a Russian troll.\n\nI don't think Democrats have ever fully understood how many votes they lose from sheer dishonesty.

I think the consensus on Reddit and other left wing (heavy) leaning social media spheres was that Trump was going to fracture the Republican Party into an ultra right wing and a more moderate wing (Mitt/Ryan era) but the reality seems far more clear that the Democratic Party is no longer a \u201cbig tent\u201d and is destined to fracture. The issue en masse is aside from Bernie there really aren\u2019t any prominent populist progressive figures to truly rally behind so we\u2019re all left with this knowledge that while Hillary and Harris were more than qualified for the role they were just never going to achieve the enthusiasm necessary to combat an enigma like Trump. \n\nGenuinely I cannot think of a non-polarizing \u201cgrassroots\u201d populist figure that can combat this new era of republican meme culture candidacy and build a new solid voting base that isn\u2019t constantly trying to appeal to moderate republicans to \u201cplease show up for us this time cause it\u2019s super duper important\u2026\u201d",

He's so laughably fucking anti-labor that it boggles the mind how blue collar, union members would vote for him. And yet, they did. Overwhelmingly. \n\n\"Fuck you, I got mine\" is the spirit that Republicans have tapped. And they keep it by saying, \"_those_ people are trying to take it away\"",

Biden should have been the transition president he said he was going to be and not try to stick it out until it was ultimately too late. Biden's approval ratings rose almost immediately after he said he was getting out, and if he had stayed a transition president the next candidate might have been able to spend a full cycle running to be the next person while the incumbent president had higher ratings",

They are a tiny minority, but for the reasons you point out, their most important issues are the most hot button issues for Democrats. It screams of a party that wants little to do with 95 percent of its actual base. They'd like it if we all just shut up and voted for them, disregarded their past histories, disregarded their stating they saw nothing different between themselves and Biden, disregard it all, and just vote mindlessly. Their only pitch to that 95 percent is abortion and \"I'm not that guy\"",

That's why they've cut education funding wherever they can. They've targeted books already, but libraries are next.\n\nWe need more reading shows (Reading Rainbow, Wishbone). More reading on social media. \n\nWe need phonics back in the classroom. \n\nAnd if we can't force these things publicly, the way it should be done, it will need to be done privately. \n\nI think we need to combine childcare and books.

Like, there have certainly been dictatorships that did evolve from socialist or communist states and continued to have elements unique to those systems, but Nazism is not one of those.\n\nWords losing their meaning because it's politically expedient to label your opponents as Nazis or believe that \"this is where all left wing ideology leads\" is a dangerous thing.  Trump's ideology and behavior meets the academic definition of fascism, as described by people who have spent their lives researching political systems.

Reading comprehension and media literacy would have saved this election, and this country- but instead we have people just believing whatever they hear most, or picking the \"truth\" that seems to best benefit them. \n\nWe NEED more reading shows, and for reading to be taught properly so we have a literate population again.

We need to go back to fuck the rich and anytime anyone like Elon puts forth an argument dismiss him out of hand because he\u2019s rich.

Look no further than his complements on Erdogan following his use of chemical warfare against his own people.   \n  \nAnd so much more.

And I can only hope that he fails to accomplish his explicit goals of mass incarceration and extra-judicial killing. I welcome the idea that I'm wrong. I want our country to thrive. But based on this man's past ineffective policies and the things he states are his desires, I won't hold my breath.

Compare that to Trump in 2020 who whined like a sore loser and spread false claims the election was stolen and refused to concede (the only presidential candidate in US History to refuse to concede). He is a narcissist and a sociopath and I hope his supporters enjoy the hell these next 4 years will bring.\n\nThe only people I feel sorry for are the 67 million who voted for Harris and tried to prevent this madness. Biden got almost 82 million votes in 2020 so that means over 14 million Democratic voters sat this election out. Those people deserve blame, too.",

So that he could see America elect its first woman president before he died. \n\nInstead, the last president of his lifetime is going to be Donald. Fucking. Trump. A fascist, rapist pig who dropped his pants and shat all over the reputation of the US and the Oval Office. He's going to die knowing that we are all officially fucked.

But a winner is only predicted on election night, by news networks. It's not the official results and nobody should be forced to concede until they're ready. Or at all. Making a phone call congratulating your opponent is polite but should not be required. Democrats are always having to take the high road and it's exhausting. \n\nI only just learned that in 2000 Fox called Florida prematurely which kind of shaped the outcome of the election.

That is a given.\n\nIf you look at the rest of the TV news industry, you basically have opinion shows on MSNBC that do a pretty good job of covering Trump and contextualizing what is happening. This was a big change from 2016 in my opinion and I think it was conscious. The problem is that the people that watch MSNBC don't need the context, most of them already know it.\n\nBut everything else, from ABC, CBS, NBC News, CNN, even NPR and PBS are all still doing the \"both sides\" thing. They report the talking point as if it is news. They will give credibility to something that is just objectively not true by reporting on it and then allowing it to be debated. They also frame what Trump says in ways he did not say it or just simply pretend he said something else that is coherent. That is all a massive problem.\n\nAs for newspapers? Their relevance dips every single week as fewer and fewer people read them, and really read at all.

Their mission is to overcome the largely Satanically-controlled world via corporate prayer, political action, and very possibly become a supernatural army along with angels to sweep away all things demonic, and emerge as the ruling body in the U.S and the world.\n\n\nIn recent years, this variable movement has become overtly political, epitomized by the \u201cSeven Mountain Mandate.\u201d This is the idea that Christians\u2014of the right sort\u2014are supposed to take dominion over society by conquering \u201cthe seven mountains\u201d of influence, or culture: government, religion, the family, education, arts and entertainment, business and the media\n\n\nhttps://www.christiancentury.org/article/features/quiet-rise-christian-dominionism\u00a0\nThe central tenet of Rushdoony\u2019s teaching is that God has tasked Christians with taking dominion over society, beginning in Genesis 1:28, in which God commands humans to take dominion over the earth.\u00a0 What would the perfectly reconstructed society look like? Rushdoony taught that it would provide man\u2014specifically the male gender\u2014with the greatest possible freedom, due to the absence of a government that currently limits that freedom. A federal government would no longer be responsible for laws that govern public safety, social programs (including public schools and welfare), or just about anything else.\n\n\nInstead, society would be reconstructed so that the male-headed family and local church fulfill the roles that currently belong to the government, which would have the authority only to protect private property and punish capital offenses. Families and churches, as the cornerstones of the reconstructed society, would implement Mosaic law, with Christ as king over what would have become a Christian nation. Without government welfare, churches would carry the responsibility of aid to the poor, and without public schools, families would be responsible for their own children\u2019s education. The economy would operate without any government regulation, meaning present laws requiring the integrity of consumer goods, protecting workers\u2019 rights, and disallowing exploitative financial practices would no longer be in effect. Because in a reconstructed America Christians would have brought God\u2019s kingdom to earth through the implementation of Mosaic law, these protections would not be necessary.",

They've shown their priorities and true faces very clearly.\n\nRepublicans are using their victory as an opportunity to show the middle finger to the left, celebrating that the people they hate lost, not that the people they support won.

With the effects of a worldwide pandemic, there was a global recession and as you mentioned, people all over the world were struggling.\n\nIf Trump was re-elected in 2020, people would likely still have struggled and not been any better. I agree that democrats do need to get rid of the elitism and listen to what people actually care about and address that, but do think that Trump is that vastly better at ensuring a strong economy, I\u2019m not so sure.\n\nI mean currently in the US unemployment rates are at a 20-year low and prices for some things like gas are coming down. I think when it comes to the economy people don\u2019t realize it takes time to \u201cfix it.\u201d I think Trump likely benefitted from policies put in place before him in which we had a strong economy.\n\nThen with the pandemic + more spending to address people\u2019s need creating a larger deficit, we didn\u2019t feel the full effects until AFTER (when Biden was in office). I think more people should realize that nothing is fixed overnight, so when it comes to economy it may take years to reap benefits from actions taken by government to address these issues.\n\nBut I hear what you\u2019re saying. My concern is throwing out all the things Trump has done (striking down Roe v Wade, colluding with Russia, organizing a coup to overturn the last election, talk about shooting guns at media and political rivals, racist/sexist comments , \u00a0etc etc) and considering the global ramifications of his election to presidency \u00a0( unchecked power for him to continue passing legislation that would benefit him/avoid further prosecution for his convicted felonies, Ukraine losing war/Russia invading into other countries, worsening in Gaza ), IGNORING \u00a0all this to vote him back in!

Personally, based on his track record, I\u2019d argue that the economy would\u2019ve fared better than it did under Biden, but none of us have a crystal ball and there were so many other factors at play.\n\nNo candidate is perfect, and I also take issue with some of DT\u2019s comments over the years. But I do believe that he has America\u2019s best interest at heart, and he seems to have respect for my country (Australia) as well. \n\nI appreciate that he didn\u2019t start any new wars during his first term, and that he is adamant about resolving the devastating conflicts that erupted during Biden\u2019s presidency. \n\nIt\u2019s not hyperbolic to say that we are uncomfortably close to a global conflict, and the Biden administration did nothing to mediate this. \n\nNo innocent person deserves to be killed and these conflicts need to be resolved. Too many children and other innocent people are dying because of the actions of extremist, power-hungry adults.\n\nI will say, it\u2019s also suspicious how much money the Biden administration has funnelled to Ukraine, only for there to be no significant progress in their fight against Russia. \n\nAs for Roe V. Wade, I personally believe making abortion a state-by-state issue is the right thing to do. It\u2019s a highly contentious, sensitive issue and if people do not want to live in a state where abortion is allowed (and potentially funded via their tax dollars), I believe that\u2019s their right.\n\nObviously, your government runs a little differently compared to ours, but I can see many parallels between our two nations and the struggles we\u2019re facing. \n\nI think it\u2019s important for all of us to remember that most people are fairly decent and want the best for their country. It\u2019s going to take a lot of work to bring both of our countries back from the states they\u2019ve found themselves in.\n\nPeople need to be having more civil, open conversations (like we\u2019re having here), rather than fighting and hurling insults. We may not agree on everything, but you and I are both on the same page in that we want the best for our countries and the people in them. That\u2019s what matters.",

         "Women and minorities voted for Trump at a higher degree this election than last. Kamala's best demo (none were good compared to Biden) outside of African American women was white men and women. Exit polling shows the economy, international relations, and immigration were the biggest issues independent and swing voters had. You can scream about race and sexism all you want but the data shows voters (especially independent voters) did not like the democratic platform for ANY of those issues (in case you forgot, Biden, a white male, was getting pummeled in the polls before he stepped down; Newsome, a white male, wasn't polling any better than kamala). \n\nA complete overhaul is needed if the dems hope to make any headway in the future. And calling the other side racist and castigating fellow decent humans who despite strongly disliking trump (large majority), and strongly being pro abortion (even larger majority), voted for him because they disliked your platform THAT MUCH, isn't going to do anything but turnoff swing voters to your cause.",
         "You're right that Kamala ran a great campaign. \n\nIt still wasn't a candidate who anyone chose, who was tied to the presidency directly so couldn't even campaign on change, and who's numbers in prior primaries were so low they left in disgrace.\n\nI'm proud of how she rose to the challenge, but there was nothing to ignite the fire of everyone to the left. Campaigning with the Cheney's was already a pill to swallow. She tried to convince Republicans and Trump voters to vote for her instead of pandering to her own base. \n\nThat's why the DNC failed.

         "Yes more civil conversations like this are much better. Open discourse listening to each side is what we should do more.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0I personally don\u2019t think the economy would have been any better under DT in 2020 but again, who knows. I appreciate he didn\u2019t start any wars but we shouldn\u2019t congratulate him for that, that would\u2019ve been worse at putting US in debt and getting us out of the hole after COVID. And abortion is a health issue, not a state issue. All women should have access to this and decisions regarding their health be made between them and their doctor. It\u2019s not so easy to pick up everything and move to a different state that likely has a different \u00a0cost of living and a different community (meaning away from families/friends/other loved ones).\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Even though Ukraine is making little progress, I think them being able to hold off this far against Russia which has far mar resources and a more sophisticated military, to me that\u2019s impressive. With DT, it\u2019s a high possibility aid to Ukraine will be cut off or significantly cut back and that Ukraine would definitely be defeated.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0I hope that most people are fairly decent but DT does say many inflammatory and vile things that are hard for decent people to ignore. I do not think he has the country\u2019s best interests in mind but puts his own interests above others. I do think it\u2019s possible for him to do some good things, like providing tax cuts to some but ultimately that will likely widen the wage gap between the super wealthy and middle class/poor.\u00a0",

All of our Supreme Court officials are under the age of 75 with three of them being women under the age of 65 do you really think any of them are going anywhere anytime soon?\n\nAccepting that the power is now with the states is something I have had to come around too , especially for the poor women in Texas, but I can see how more power has been given to the people in those states to choose. Many states across the country had abortion extensions on their ballot, and although all of them did not pass ( like Texas), most of them did and it was based on the choice of the people in that state. This Country is not sunk based on this one issue and I would encourage women to understand their state abortion laws and get out in their community and be politically active there to fight for what you want. \n\nAll states have abortion has a right if the woman\u2019s life is in danger, most also have medical exceptions and rape and incest.

         "Some sadly voted for him, too. I recently found out that a colleague, a black middle-aged woman, mother of 5 children, is a huge Trumper when we organized a trip to vote together with the students.  \n\nMy ed team and other staff in the deans office also dissuaded the students from voting, almost preventing them from leaving the building.  They insisted on them having chaperones, which they didn\u2019t require, at all.  \n\nThe 20something staff were so disaffected when I sent them to do one thing: take the students and help them to vote, they decided, instead to order pizza and bring it back to the building to eat it when the pizza place was actually closer to the voting place and they could have resumed the line to vote following their meal. It was across the street. \n\nThey were totally consumed with eating, stayed in the cafeteria for two hours missing their opportunity to vote, and it was astonishing what poor example they set. It\u2019s weird and wild how idk what to call it-not entirely lazy but like crazy and lazy and stupid all at once they often are regarding teaching students civic engagement.\n\nThe following day, I insisted they try again but sent someone else to vote with them (a retiree aged staffer and a 30 something staffer) because the younger staff couldn\u2019t manage to wait in line. \n\nAdditionally, the behavior team had a strange group of middle-aged black men who were \u201cboth sides\u201d-ing the kids upon their departure. So wild, too and astonishing because normally they cannot wait for us to leave on school field trips.  \n\nThey were going back and forth with me on the walkie, insisting the students \u201c***don\u2019t know what to do***\u201d \u201c***have no direction***\u201d by the school counselor, also a bizarre bully of a person, and the behavior management team as well as security(Security mind you is a retiree, a woman.) I just said very loudly and calmly,\u201d****THEY KNOW WHAT TO DO****\u201d One of the subs asked who would go, and I responded, \u201cYOU ARE GOING\u201d and bless his heart he said \u201croger THAT\u201d\n\nHad I gone on this outing, I would have never made it out of the building with my students, at all due to the anti education rhetoric many at my school espouses, weird qanon conspiracies and blatant misogyny and racism under the guise of \u201cimproving the economy\u201d. My boss and his boss are not this way, but a fair amount of people in the building are. \n\nThey also bizarrely couldn\u2019t manage to pick up pizzas that they ordered from across the street, asking an old man, a sub to walk to the restaurant and carry their food back to our building. \n\nI\u2019m just so sickened and baffled at so many people that just think that the economy (Goofy they think Trump will save it as well, because he fucked up the economy his first term.) is more important than anything else, even democracy, even basic human rights.\n\nJust to clarify, my students are legal adults and have full cognitive abilities, just some mental health issues.  I obliged, but even then they made it so difficult that two of my students just didn\u2019t vote after being excited to initially for the first time. \n\nIt\u2019s frightening how many people are brainwashed across demographics. It\u2019s not just white dudes, gay guys, Latinos, it\u2019s like everyone has a subset that has been brainwashed by Trumpism and fascism.",

If Democrats wanna be mad at someone they should be looking at Obama who had three branches of government all Democrat who could have easily solidified it into law. However he stated it was not a priority for him. It could be argued he did that so it can be a topic in every election and a way for Democrats to win votes. There are other topics we must start taking about in all elections going forward outside of abortion. I want to hear clear coherent debates on policy where things can actually change.",

This is a gross oversimplification, but I want to say that what happens with minority groups and women who \u201cfall\u201d for Trump rhetoric and propaganda is more nuanced than the rest.  We often see subtle hints that these groups want to identify with the majority, which is an empowering feeling for them.  \n\nNobody wants to be a \u201cminority\u201d or feel marginalized.  So one seemingly more common approach by minority groups is to OVERCOMPENSATE for their otherwise second-class status among majority groups in social circles.  Make no mistake about it, this is a classic form of Stockholm Syndrome whereby the person with little to no power begins sympathizing and defending their oppressor.  The purpose being a survival mechanism that is profoundly rooted in a desire to empower the victim to a status equal to their master.\n\nWhen I saw Hispanics, women, and other minority groups vote in overwhelming numbers against past norms and for Trump - I began to realize the sickness was growing. Hispanics want to be seen as normal \u201cwhite\u201d Americans are. Blacks want to be seen as normal \u201cwhite\u201d Americans are.  And some are willing to replace their entire upbringing and cultural identity in favor of an idea that empowers and uplifts them from the shackles of marginalization.\n\nBut what they will find is an even greater oppression than they\u2019ve ever had before - an insidious corruption of self and personal identity that will rob them of any liberty they still had.\n\nTragic",

That isn't a difference of people voting for Trump, that is a difference of people not voting because the party and campaign did not give them a reason to. We don't have Covid and a current Trump administration to ramp up the fear and make that an easier job, so they had to run actual competent strategies to get their base out. Instead they ran to the right, embraced a incredibly small set of Republicans who couldn't deal with Trump again, and what was the result? Those people just didn't vote. And Harris lost a Massive voting block because the campaign didn't give a fuck about those people. They told us 'we don't care about your vote, you'll do it anyway if you know what's good for you, we only care about the republicans that are close to the middle'. It was a shitty, loser strategy that abandoned what helped them to win in 2020 when the race was undoubtable Much easier and didn't adjust for the current climate. \n\nThis campaign failed us and we're all suffering for it. I voted for Harris, but I Completely understand why so many others didn't because that's how humans work. If you don't give them something to vote for, 99% of the time they just won't vote.

If what matters to you is finding a little bit of secure footing when the economy in your own home is not doing well, it makes a sort of sense to choose a less appealing person, if you believe that their ability to deliver for you will outweigh their repulsiveness as a human being. That's a calculus people make when people feel really bleak about their own outlook.\n\nThe emotional desire to admonish those voters makes sense, but if *you* make the same calculus about your own outlook in the same way, what is the benefit in throwing blame in their direction? Will that change their mind, and get them to see your side of things? Or, will it entrench within their minds that the Democrats aren't interested in addressing their issues, in a way that is satisfying or credible to them? \n\nAnything that we do to reinforce the bonds between those who vote red for their own reasons, and those who vote red because they are angry hate monsters with nothing under their red hats, is only going to ensure further defeat and despair for those of us who want to see the red hats go away forever. We need all the allies we can get, and the best way is to disengage the mass of voters from the extremist buffoons who make bigger promises.

She has also said she wants to raise the minimum wage and while also supporting the PRO Act.\n\nBut actions are louder than words, right? Go look at how Biden consistently fought and finally succeeded in raising the federal minimum wage to $15. Look at how his administration called out price gouging (all while being called a socialist by Republicans no less) which resulted in grocery prices lowering. Look at how it's only blue states which have raised their minimum wage. Then go look at how Biden continued to help rail workers get what they want behind the scenes. Go look at how Biden dealt with the dockworker strike. Go look at the legislative platform of the Biden-Harris administration:\n\nHarris supports the PRO Act, Trump opposes it. Harris supports PLA's and the Biden-Harris administration has mandated them on most federal funded projects, Trump banned PLAs on federal projects. Harris is against right-to-work laws, Trump supports a national right-to-work law. The Butch-Lewis Act saved the pensions of over a million union workers, Trump was against the Butch-Lewis Act all 3 times the law was presented to him, the Biden-Harris administration told congress they would not sign the American Rescue Plan unless the Butch-Lewis Act was part of it.\n\nThen go look at Trump introducing tax cuts skewed to the rich, not supporting raising the minimum wage, saying he supports firing striking workers, how he hates paying overtime and how he talks about supporting domestic manufacturing all while offshoring the manufacturing of his merchandise overseas.\n\nThese working class people still voted for Trump though. Go look at how the majority of union members were Trump supporters still. Dems didn't abandon the working class, the working class abandoned Dems. 'Saying we want more pro-worker policies' while, time and again, refusing to show up to give Dems a mandate to do so is delusional.\n\nThis is the same Sanders saying this just a few months ago, fyi: [\u2018Strong, progressive agenda\u2019: Sen.

Attempts to do so will alienate supporters and cause them to go \u201cWell, they\u2019re just as bad as the other side!\u201d Communists, socialists, anarchists and republicans tore each other apart during the Spanish Civil War, and the Communists and Socialists were basically having a civil war among themselves in 1930s Germany. Meanwhile, the fascists cajole, threaten, and bribe other right wing groups into falling in line, which then sends an image of unity and strength that attracts the so-called moderates who are frightened by infighting on the left.\n\nThis is also why Democrats struggle with messaging. Saying one thing will inevitably piss off part of your constituency and cause them to stay home. Meanwhile, Trump can say the most vile things and Republicans can sleep at night saying, \u201cYeah I voted for him; even though I don\u2019t agree that we should be slaughtering our fellow citizens, I\u2019m okay with it because taxes/immigration/abortion/whatever other excuse\u201d.",

I live in a province that just held provincial elections where the left (NDP) barely beat out the BC Conservatives who had 1) no plan released until 3 days after early voting started and 2) ran on a platform of letting people assume they were the Federal Conservatives. The NDP won by just 3000 votes despite being the successful incumbent party because people are not interested in actual actionable promises; they want grandiose sweeping declarations of \u201cchange\u201d that are only feasible in fantasy.",

Its contents, which include a broad expansion of executive powers; a de facto national abortion ban, increased restrictions on contraception; brutal policies against undocumented migrants; and the elimination of several federal agencies (including the Department of Education), didn\u2019t sit well with prospective voters.\n\nTrump feigned ignorance of the plan, despite his close ties to those involved in crafting it, while Democrats did all they could to warn about the conservative blueprint for a second Trump term.\n\nSure enough, less than 24 hours after the election was called for Trump, his allies, advisers, and prominent supporters were celebrating the now-open road to Project 2025\u2019s implementation. \n\nOn Wednesday, former Trump adviser Steve Bannon \u2014 who just weeks ago completed a four-month prison sentence on a contempt of Congress conviction \u2014- lauded Christian Nationalist Matt Walsh, a commentator at The Daily Wire, on his War Room broadcast. \n\nWalsh had written on X, formerly Twitter: \u201cNow that the election is over I think we can finally say that yeah actually Project 2025 is the agenda.

Not even when all their cities were in ruins, and Russia was pounding Berlin into rubble. They gave up when they ran out means to fight. Their precious Fuhrer decided that if Russia could not be defeated, then Germany deserved no victory, and so ordered Germany itself to be destroyed.

The immigration authorities would not be so favorable to immigrants under Trump administration as we saw before in 2016.\n\nTrump did talk a lot about chain immigration as a problem and the right wing completely hates it.

His worst urges include bowing to strongman dictators, betraying our allies, stealing national defense documents, oh and having his political enemies killed. \n\nIt's too fucking late now, but people simply need to listen to what the fuck this man is saying he is going to do with the unchecked power he's just been voted into.

Their mission is to overcome the largely Satanically-controlled world via corporate prayer, political action, and very possibly become a supernatural army along with angels to sweep away all things demonic, and emerge as the ruling body in the U.S and the world.\n\n\nIn recent years, this variable movement has become overtly political, epitomized by the \u201cSeven Mountain Mandate.\u201d This is the idea that Christians\u2014of the right sort\u2014are supposed to take dominion over society by conquering \u201cthe seven mountains\u201d of influence, or culture: government, religion, the family, education, arts and entertainment, business and the media\n\n\nhttps://www.christiancentury.org/article/features/quiet-rise-christian-dominionism\u00a0\nThe central tenet of Rushdoony\u2019s teaching is that God has tasked Christians with taking dominion over society, beginning in Genesis 1:28, in which God commands humans to take dominion over the earth.\u00a0 What would the perfectly reconstructed society look like? Rushdoony taught that it would provide man\u2014specifically the male gender\u2014with the greatest possible freedom, due to the absence of a government that currently limits that freedom. A federal government would no longer be responsible for laws that govern public safety, social programs (including public schools and welfare), or just about anything else.\n\n\nInstead, society would be reconstructed so that the male-headed family and local church fulfill the roles that currently belong to the government, which would have the authority only to protect private property and punish capital offenses. Families and churches, as the cornerstones of the reconstructed society, would implement Mosaic law, with Christ as king over what would have become a Christian nation. Without government welfare, churches would carry the responsibility of aid to the poor, and without public schools, families would be responsible for their own children\u2019s education. The economy would operate without any government regulation, meaning present laws requiring the integrity of consumer goods, protecting workers\u2019 rights, and disallowing exploitative financial practices would no longer be in effect. Because in a reconstructed America Christians would have brought God\u2019s kingdom to earth through the implementation of Mosaic law, these protections would not be necessary.",

         "That bill did actually fix a real problem, although the problem is relatively small and gets blown far out of proportion by the Chamber of Commerce.   \n\nThe problem, insofar as it exists, is that there are people and lawyers who make a living out of being ADA gadflies.     They find a business that has defects, make an intentional scene, and then file a lawsuit against the business for violating the ada.   The cost of defense litigation and the possibility of attorney's fees means that they can usually extract a quick settlement.   The insurance company pays out 10 or 15 grand, the lawyer collects half of it, and the insurance company tells the business to fix the problem. \n\nI know that these cases exist because I've been a defense counsel on these cases. I don't think they are terribly common in the grand scheme of things.   \n\nThe bill was a pretty extreme solution but I don't think that requiring some level of good faith effort to notify a business and seek an accommodation before filing a lawsuit is inherently unreasonable, much the same way that there is a procedure requirement of notifying the EEOC and getting a right to sue letter before filing a case of employment discrimination.",

         "I've been looking into the ACA issue since I also totally depend on it.  I thought it would be all settled at this point, but thanks to these morons who voted Trump back in, it's all back on the table.  After spending a day researching the history of all the ways the R's have tried to kill it over the last 14 years, this is my take.\n\nAfter many lawsuits over the years - including those pushed by Trump's team even though he lied about it during the campaign - their last try to knock it down through the courts was in 2021 and it got nowhere.  I think this avenue has dried up at this point.\n\nThe other way is to repeal it through the legislature.  Even if the R's take the House, the problem for them is that such a repeal would take 60 votes in the Senate, which, even after this week's seat gains for them they still don't have (I think they'll have 54 or so).  \n\nSo this means the only way they can really attack the ACA is through the \"budget reconciliation\" process which (as I understand it) allows certain bills out of the House to be passed by the Senate with a simple majority (51 votes) but only if they concern budgetary elements of a law.  So what they can do, and in fact what they *tried* to do back in 2017 - again, under Trump, who denied it later - is to basically cripple the program by pulling all the funding for premium support.  \n\nThis would not have technically repealed it, but it would have sent the private insurance market into a \"death spiral\" that after a time would've had the same effect.  For some reason I don't quite understand, there were enough R's to block that vote in the Senate at the time (maybe there were still a few reasonable ones left then?)   If they tried again though, given the Maga mandate we see now, maybe they'd go ahead and pass it, which would basically be the end for me and many others because we'd essentially have no way to find (or afford) decent insurance in the private market.",

Too many people vote based on how they feel about their pocketbook on the day they step in the ballot box. That's it, that's the ballgame.

If you look at how demographics voted, he LOST supporters with white people and gained substantially with every other demo minus black women. 100% did not see that coming.\n\nIt really makes me wonder how policy will change because of it. If minorities are now a major backer of trump what does the next 4 years look like? Does he change his rhetoric a little bit or do they keep going the direction it seems and he loses all support in 4 years.\n\n  \nI dont like saying it but as a middle age straight white dude that voted Harris I don't think the Ds can run anyone but a youngish normal straight white guy for the next 20+ years. It's not what I think is right but just looking at how this went and how the 2016 election went I think it's fair to say we are not ready for a woman. It's time to play it safe even if that means somethings taking a back seat for awhile. Shut up about any policies that don't mention the economy and housing. That's what people care about. It's sad to say we cant run on purely \"this is the right thing to do policies\". People care about being able to afford to live and everything else falls way behind.",

         "I live in the Southwest and here, almost all of the \"brown skinned\" Latinos/Mexican-American people I know are Evangelical Christians, not Catholic. I live in an area that has a lot of Mexican-American immigrants; the gym I go to is owned by an immigrant from Mexico and all the members are also Mexican immigrants except for me. (I'm a gringa lol.) They are always inviting me to go to church with them and it's a big Protestant/Evangelical Mega church. They are always sharing sermons by televangelist/gospel prosperity type Mega church pastors, and rejoicing when Daddy Yankee said he quit show biz to dedicate his life to Jesus and will only sing religious songs now or something.\n\nI'm originally from a small town in PA but I've lived here over 20 years; I was raised Evangelical Christian out there and left the church but from what I saw there and here, quite a large percentage of Latino/hispanic families are Protestant and Evangelical churches seem to cater to them. When I was growing up it really didn't matter what skin color or race you were if you came to our church and believed or at least pretended to believe in the (IMO ridiculous) religious teachings. Of course, it would matter if you were LGBTQA+ and \"non-repetent\" but they seemed to welcome straight Latinos with open arms. We were encouraged to marry early and have big families and the minority members of our youth group, including Latino, Black and even a Native American, seemed to be equal with whites in the \"courtship\" pool and there were quite a few interracial marriages. My fellow Evangelical Christian youth who stayed in the religion instead of leaving it didn't seem to care about the race or skin color of their spouse so long as they shared the same religious belief and both wanted to settle down and start raising families young.\n\nSo I guess I really disagree with you that Latinos can't be in the crowd of white Evangelicals. I'm really not sure about the Catholic part as the Catholic Latinos I know are more of the traditional, older ones with more money and privilege and they do tend to stick to their own Catholic churches and they tend to be liberal at least when it comes to social causes and charities. But the younger (and by younger I even mean 50 and below... I'm 43 and my friends/neighbors here range in age from somewhat older to a lot younger) Latinos I know who are lower or middle class, some kind of struggling financially, are solidly Evangelical Protestants and from what I can tell as an outsider who doesn't really have a stake in things considering I'm not religious and won't be going with them, they seem to feel very happy and welcome in the Mega churches here from what they say. And in my hometown it seemed like that too.

They all marched out to back the candidate that they shoehorned in without a primary, brought a bunch of \"elites\", from George Clooney to Beyonce, AND even brought in super conservatives like the Cheneys to their cause and it made zero difference in the end.  Probably less than zero seeing as how 15 million **fewer** Dems came out to vote.  \\*It's time for a new strategy\\*.\n\nGive me meaningful policy proposals.  Give me facts.  Give me relevant precedent to the things that you're proposing.  Make people understand that it's not the illegal immigrants or trans prisoners that are screwing over their wallets but rather the fat cats at the head of billion (hell, now trillion) dollar corporations that aren't paying their fair share in taxes and aren't \"trickling down\" dignified wages to their workers.  60 years ago, the CEOs on average made 20 times what their average worker's wage was.  Now, they're making something like 365 times what their average worker makes.  I don't know about you, but my boss sure af does not do 365 years worth of my work in 1 year.  Make voters understand this disparity.\n\nDiversity, equity, and inclusion are important, fighting for people to have the freedom to live and love how they want is important, but we need to shift some more of that focus to the class disparity that unites the vast majority of us.  This was something Bernie has understood and been shouting about for literally decades (it's something MLK understood when he orchestrated the Poor People's Campaign), and it's the reason I canvassed for him in '16 and in '20.  The Democratic establishment put a lid on it both times because they thought they knew better.  It worked in '20, but Election night this year made it clear that we can't just campaign on the other party being a threat.  Don't just give people something to vote against.  Give them something to vote for.\n\nEdit: and just to drive my point further home, here's [Bernie in a Fox News Town Hall winning over the crowd with his \"radical\" policy proposals](https://youtu.be/jthr_9gIkKo?si=5tcht9r7rL0CgPAk).",

Their lies were so brazen that it was inevitable they'd be found out, it's literally things like cutting away half a sentence so that the meaning changes.  \n\nThey ran identity based hate, accusing black men of being misogynist for not voting Kamala Harris.  They accused white women of being aggressively oppressed to the degree where the only reason they aren't voting Kamala is because their husbands would beat them.\n\nAll of it portrays to this fantastical, reality free victim mindset that doesn't represent the vast majority of the public.  Most women don't consider themselves victims, of society, or the men in their lives, because most of them aren't.  I feel sympathy for those who are but your situation isn't the norm or the standard and if you think so, it's because you've been lied too.  \n\nIf you think Trump hates black people, then you're in the same boat.  Trump doesn't give two shits about black people, or latinos, or white people, he clearly cares about money and winning, and while that's childish it's an easy read and the broad range of vaguely fascist propaganda reads on the state of the world that has become that standard in liberal echo chambers is so detached from reality it's literally offending any liberal who's there out of a sense of intellectualism, or because they believe in a thorough social safety net away, because it's so obviously about a religious fervor of \"Were moral people, they're immoral, evil racist bigots\" that's both detached from reality and the most ignorant brand of propaganda rabble rousing.\n\nYou all collectively yawned when the Twitter files hit, but reality is that was a wake up call about how bad it's gotten.  This is barely short of the \"ministry of truth\" level bullshit and the explicitly lies, and frankly the bureaucratic stupidity that's creeping into more normal aspects of life, left no choice, to support the Democrats in this election would have been to support an attitude that the public is stupid and all they need is an identity politick message and they'll fall in line behind literally any agenda.  \n\nYou lost because you backed power hungry, lying politicians as they said literally any immoral, racist, sexist bullshit that they thought would get them a little boost.

         ">Maybe the dems can actually focus on the economy as the main message for once\n\nWhy does this keep getting trotted out?\n\nHarris' top 2 issues that she spoke about all the time were abortion rights and creating an opportunity economy. The economy was never an issue Dems ignored. Their biggest flaw was being unwilling to lie like Trump was and just make simple and empty promises about lowering the prices of everything.\n\n>Social issues are divisive and aren\u2019t going to win you as many votes as you think.\n\nYes, they are, but go point out how many times Harris campaigned on social issues outside of reproductive healthcare. It's not Dems pushing the culture war.\n\nRepublicans are though, they spent hundreds of millions on anti-trans ads this election cycle. That includes Trump who spent 36 million on anti-trans ads in October (41% of the total ad spendng).\n\nIt's divisive and one side seems drawn to such hate unfortunately.",

         "Dems were able to outspend Republicans because they received significantly more from small dollar donors than Trump did.\n\nGo look at the breakdown of funding between Harris and Trump. Trump received far more from billionaires.\n\n- In this election cycle, billionaires have flexed their muscles more than ever before. According to a new report by Americans for Tax Fairness, 150 billionaire families have spent a total of $1.9 billion (\u20ac1.75bn) in support of presidential and congressional candidates this cycle, 58% more than four years ago.\n\n- Roughly $570 million (\u20ac525m) have gone to Donald Trump's campaign, $130 million (\u20ac119.7m) to Kamala Harris.

It should have been brought up at every public appearance that it was mostly the Republican party that blocked it. They should have enflamed people's frustration at these things to make them see.\n\n\nDemocrats get accused of \"extreme rhetoric\" when they're like Oliver fucking Twist before the headmaster, asking for goddamn concessions, and shrugging their shoulders when things don't go their way.

How about we CRUSH him, CRUSH the elitist, corporate bastards that keep the American people under their boots? We're supposed to win this shit with rainbows and laughter?\n\n\nYou'll see in my comment history that I've had nothing BUT good to say about Kamala, nothing but support for blue this election. Because it's what needed to be said in the moment. But the race is over, she lost, and it's time to call out the bullshit.\n\n\nI say this as a trans person. I'm terrified of a Trump future, and I voted for Harris.\n\n\nBut Jesus fucking Christ, can we get people FIRED THE FUCK UP? I'm not talking about rallies with all sorts of celebrity endorsements. I'm talking about speaking to the people, and being able to pull huge rallies WITHOUT celebrity bribery.\n\n\nThere's SO MUCH WRONG that could be fixed with progressove policies.

Or do we still want to keep pretending that people care or pay attention to actual workable policy?\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUZ-rbbyAIY\n\nLike I said, Harris failed by not realizing that voters cared the most about getting prices low, which is why her message of getting ahead and lifting people did not resonate. She would have done much better by just promising to bring prices down even if that's not one she can follow through on. Hindsight is 20/20, unfortunately.",

I've been watching the Democrats too.\n\nThe Democrats think if you have power, it has to be THEIR power or you aren't allowed to have it.\n\nMusk, conversely, has organized engineers to fix the worlds biggest problems.\n\nThere's no question which one is trustworthy.  Musk says things that are often jocular and juvenile, still, to this day, because he doesn't moderate himself.  I haven't seen a statement out of an establishment democrat in ages that didn't reek of doublespeak.  The lies though, the easily verifiable lies about Donald Trump are really special, and the fact you still somehow think it's some kind of propaganda bullshit when it's so easily verifiable and obvious, just speaks loads as to why this happened.\n\nBut hey, keep misquoting Donald Trump, you'll get upvoted by the petty propaganda hacks that frequent any politically themed space on Reddit, maybe it'll make you feel good about yourself for a while, before you remember the Democrats overwhelmingly lost because the public doesn't agree with you.",

He won on hate. I doubt most of you are ready to acknowledge this, but we are not *really* a nation of good people. We're not. We're a nation of people, and basic math says half of them are less good than the other half. So, how good is the average? C'mon now. Let's be honest.\n\nFor over 60 years... hell, for over a 150 years... we've been begging our fellow citizens to be good, or at the least be decent, and time after time, so many of our fellow citizens rejected even basic human decency.\n\nDonald Trump said the south should have been allowed to keep some slavery, and he WON.\n\nAnd he won.\n\nThere's an old joke by George Carlin about stupid people that comes to mind:\n\n> \"Think about how stupid the average person is, and then realize that HALF OF 'EM ARE STUPIDER THAN THAT.\"\n\nGranted, he should have said Median, not Average, but it's a joke... and a damn good one too.\n\nNow think about *THAT* in terms of good vs evil. Think about how rotten the average person is. No, really. Pause for a moment and think about it. Think about how many people you know who go out of their way to do good, vs how many don't give a damn.\n\nLike it or not, asking someone to at least be decent is more than the average American is willing to do. That's why conservatives seethe with anger at the thought of someone using a different pronoun.\n\nThe average American isn't that good of a person. Lots of us are, but be honest. Is the average American? Not really.\n\nThe average American hates minorities enough to vote to screw them over, every change they get. Hell, even minorities hate each other in this country. Black and Hispanic communities often hate each other. This religion hates that religion. Gays even hate gays who aren't gay enough. I'm a straight guy. Years ago, I dated a bi woman who was active in the gay community. She broke up with me because her gay friends were upset that she was dating a man (even though I'm a man who has marched for gay rights, because good people stand up for other people's rights. I digress).\n\nI voted for Kamala Harris, and I am proud to have done so. I was excited for the potential of a Harris presidency. But I'm not surprised Trump defeated her.\n\nTrump didn't win on politics. He won on hate, and his voters are using excuses with a wink and a nod to justify voting for hate.\n\nThe United States is a more-hateful country than most of us are ready or willing to admit. That's why, generation after generation, good people have to fight just to spread basic human decency let alone love.\n\nLast night, hate won. But not within me.\n\nI just hope the voters, and the nation, can live with the consequences of the embracement of hate.

There is no being neutral. It's one or the other.\n\nI think plain apathy is the more accurate answer. The Democratic party as always been plagued with apathy. One voter hinted to that as the reason yesterday when he was interviewed for an exit poll. He said he wasn't going to vote. It just wasn't worth his effort. But his girlfriend nagged him into it. So he ended up voting for Harris since that's what his girlfriend wanted him to do. So it wasn't that he was against Harris. He just couldn't be bothered.",
         "They didn't like democracy or rule of rule of law enough to vote either. Even if they didn't like Kamala, those are the stakes.",
         "Wish the Gaza supporting folks had listened. Like of course I didn't want a genocide happening over there, of course my heart breaks for fellow suffering humans, but I didn't think flushing a vote while looking smug would fix anything.",
         "Well, that's a good perspective to take. Like I said, I don't share your optimism at all, but I have no reason to try to talk you out of it. I would rather that you be right",
         "I got 2 young ones and I don\u2019t see them getting the future you speak of without a lot of blood being spilled. The cost of that optimism is the reality of death and oppression. The  fascists aren\u2019t going to give it up, they have now been emboldened and it will only be taken from \u201ctheir cold dead hands\u201d. Buckle up and hug your kids because depending upon how far they are willing to go a lot of us\u2026including you may not come home to see them enjoy it. Peace.",
         "Sure, that's all true. But Trump's regime doesn't have to last long for our decline to continue. I absolutely don't think the current incarnation of the American right will be some kind of permanent thing, not at all. But beating Trumpism is not going to save our civilization at this point. Climate change is in the cards. We can't solve it, and it's going to massively increase poverty and misery. Increases in poverty and misery will lead to worsening political instability. Worsening political instability will in turn lead to more increases in poverty and misery. Rinse and repeat. This vicious cycle isn't going to be solved in our lifetimes, or our children's lifetimes. It will get better eventually, maybe, but we'll be LONG dead by that point",
         "The sort of stupid thing about it is, though \u2026\n\n>> unpopular candidate \n\nWell, that\u2019s objectively true\n\n>> switched nominee\n\nYeah, Biden should\u2019ve never run a second time and should have allowed a democratic primary\n\nSo there is definitely a giant fuck up here, but \u2026\n\n>> Identity politics\n\nI haven\u2019t watched all speeches, but from what I\u2019ve seen, it was Republicans who emphasized identity politics, democrats didn\u2019t really go into the topic\n\n>> was in power during inflation\n\nSure, but was also in power during the greatest job creation and economic recovery since the Great Depression, which somehow didn\u2019t matter? Don\u2019t get me wrong, rampant inflation is nothing good, but it neither happened because of Bidens admin (but by external factors) nor did they fail to address it. So inflation comes down to bad communication on Harris part and that no media outlet called Trump out for his insane economic bullshit.\n\n>> a rise in crime\n\nCrime rates fell continuously though, so that\u2019s more of a feeling than reality.\n\n>> a border crisis\n\nThat democrats wanted to solve, Trump refused to do and no one cared. \n\nBesides the massive strategic failures (which, don\u2019t get me wrong, are fucking bad), the rest is more or less not really true in the way it\u2019s often get depicted and how media portraits that. It still matters, but not the reality but the perception of these issues and Trump is a master of the lie.\n\nEdit: a word",
         "I don't actually think the candidate was the problem. It was the message of keeping the status quo with some minor adjustments. The status quo is that billionaires and megacorps own our country and do whatever they want to us. When Kamala tried to speak about taxing the rich, big Dem donors shut it down. So people ended up taking a flyer on something good possibly coming out of chaos, because at least there's a chance something will change. Not saying it was a good or rational decision to hand the keys to the kingdom to Putin, Xi, and the paypal mafia, or the bullies who want to hurt anyone different from them, but I get the impulse to try something, anything other than a guaranteed continuation of the status quo.",
         "If only.  But that would be unfair to all the people who live there who didn't vote for their kids to marinate in carcinogenic lakes.",
         "When my daughter was born I knew that there was no sacrifice I would not make for her. Certainly don\u2019t want to miss out on her life but if that\u2019s what it takes to make her world a better place than it is what it is.",
         "If my grandparents had the will to fight Fascism until the last men, I will to.\n\nI have no intention of going quietly. Fuck those who don't see other human beings as equals. Fuck those who value  money over human lives.",
         "So it goes. Nothing lasts forever and the birth pangs of a new age are always terrible and full of monsters. But life goes on and eventually an equilibrium will be reached. How terrible those birth pangs are, that\u2019s up to those of us who have the resolve to do what\u2019s necessary in the time given to us. I for one, am not going to wallow in grief and self pity. It\u2019s time to do the work to preserve what can be preserved and to prepare the soil for those who will come later.",
         "That's a fine attitude, I suppose, but saying \"not worth worrying about even though the problems will outlive us and cause misery to our children and grandchildren\" is not much cause for comfort. Most people actually are worried about themselves and their kin, and thinking that things will get better several centuries in the future isn't much of a retort to that",
         "I really commend you words. \nWhat comes next depends on what we do now.\n\nIf the fascist are starting to cling to power we must act quickly and effectively.\n\nThe amount of damage they can cause is directly related to the amount of despair and inaction we allow ourselves",
         "Sorry if I didn\u2019t make myself clear. I am not saying don\u2019t worry. I am terrified. What I am saying is that no matter how dark the night gets, the sun eventually rises. We have to keep that truth in mind because if we give into despair we are lost. Every few generations have to go through something like this and as much as we wished it hadn\u2019t been our time to rise to the occasion, to quote Gandalf, \u201cso do all who see such times, but that is not up to us to decide, all that we have is to decide what to do with the time given us.\u201d And to also Quote Gandalf \"It is not our part to master all the tides of the world, but to do what is in us for the succour of those years wherein we are set, uprooting the evil in the fields that we know, so that those who live after may have clean earth to till\""

Biden chose to prioritize one over the other repeatedly and expected to be rewarded for it. his rhetorical and political priority needed to be easing anxieties about inflation domestically and he chose instead to publicly emphasize foreign policy over and over and over - despite the withdrawal from Afghanistan irreparably crippling his credibility as a geopolitical statesman in the first year of his term, and despite the public repeatedly and emphatically stating their immediate and pressing concerns about the economic situation domestically. \n\nhe didn't need to hammer the public with his support for Ukraine in order to secure it. there are things you simply do and don't talk about when you are in power. send them aid quietly and then go assure the public about domestic concerns loudly. his desperate need to be seen by the public as the savior of American military power globally will ironically be it's undoing.",

We need to restrict the border so we can get the process sorted out, illegal\u00a0immigration has increased which only makes the process even more difficult & puts a strain on social services. Biden\u00a0signed an EO to tighten the border earlier this year; Canada & some European countries are also cutting down on immigration because it truly is an issue, not just \u201cthey took err jobs\u201d shit. This would also help tame the fentanyl epidemic that is plaguing our country, I don\u2019t know anyone that hasn\u2019t lost someone to fentanyl & it\u2019s a contributing factor to poverty and homelessness. China manufactures it then the cartels smuggle it through the southern border, which brings me to 2.\n\n2: We\u2019re in an economic war with China; they have tariffs on US goods, they commit massive amounts of industrial espionage & IP theft to weaken US business interests. Biden imposed tariffs on China, Kamala campaigned for tariffs also. The number I\u2019ve read for Trump is 60%.\u00a0\n\n6: In 2014 only 3 of 30 countries were in compliance with the 2% of GDP agreement, they addressed it and agreed to all be at 2% within a decade. In 2023 it was only 11 of 30 & I believe this year it\u2019ll be around 20 of 30. The threat to pull from NATO seemed to be an ultimatum for countries to actually follow through on what they agreed upon & if those agreements are met then the issue is moot.\u00a0\n\n11: I don\u2019t necessarily agree with this, just wanted to comment on it.

         "Hello, I voted for Trump last night.\n\n1. Yes, any illegal immigrant. I favor strict enforcement of E-Verify (with jail time for business owners who circumvent such checks) as the best and most efficacious way to deport illegals. I also favor allowing local police to report and arrest illegals, the Remain in Mexico policy, and the wall.\n\n2. Tariffs ideally should be a floating target that takes into account the discrepancy between the importing countries wages and environmental regulations and our own, plus an additional 3 to 5% to encourage domestic production. If a foreign firm builds a factory in the US to sell their product, there should be no tariff (or very small, say 0.15%) on those goods produced domestically.\n\n3. I don't support reducing the FDA. In fact, there should be stricter quality controls similar to Europe, and carcinogenic substances such as Red 40 should be banned. I think people should be able to drink raw milk, etc., if they want, but you should be required to put warnings on such products, and you should be able to sue a producer whose product gets you sick through negligence or fraud. RFK Jr. I think will do well, for the most part, in this regard.\n\n4. ACA should be replaced wholesale. I favor a free (or nearly so) public option available to all and paid for by taxes, but that would necessarily be bare bones. The rest of the health care market should be de-regulated -- and you should still be able to sue for damages, etc.\n\n5. Sounds great. There is a ton of inefficiencies in the federal agencies, duplicate missions, things that can be combined, etc. \n\n6. I favor America leaving NATO entirely. It served it's purpose in the Cold War, and is simply an arm of imperialism at this point. We do not need to fear Russia or China, and do not need NATO to \"contain\" either.\n\n7. I favor a two state solution to the Israeli-Palestine conflict. It is unlikely however, and we should not greatly involve ourselves in it either way, except to broker diplomatic solutions.\n\n8. I favor closing down the border entirely. People can still apply to legally immigrate.\n\n9. I don't favor invading Mexico. I do favor eliminating Mexican drug cartels that harm Americans, but we should not go into Mexico to do it, except perhaps in small join task forces with Mexican forces.\n\n10. This is essentially deportation of illegals, which I am in favor of.\n\n11. I don't favor this necessarily, but I think that immigration from countries with recent terror strikes against the USA should be restricted.\n\n12. I don't favor this.",

Fine. Call it backpay. If you want our help and protection, sorry, but you got to pay. If we're going to make enemies with foreign superpowers, meeting the bare minimum requirements should be expected at ALL times, not just when Russia starts getting a little greedy. It's an alliance.

They ARE stealing jobs. 10-20% (appromxitely.) of the entire construction workforce in the US is illegal immigrants. I'd personally say it's higher from the amount I've seen firsthand. Yes, the bosses are paying them lower than minimum wage, and they aren't getting healthcare, but thats WHY they are getting the jobs over Americans. First hand, I've seen it in MANY crews and in all parts of the field (mostly harder labor, I won't deny), from concrete crews, to framing crews, and so on and so forth. \n\nTrump will probably deport all that he can, and that may not be the right way to go about it, but I don't think legalizing people who don't speak a lick of English or hold any core American values is right either, especially when it's mostly latino people, mostly in swing states, and for the most part besides the downtrend this year vote Democrat. Like... That's a real issue. If they coincidentlly all voted republican, I know the Democrats wouldn't be so eager to legalize them.

I think here is the only part I kind of agree with the idea. Sure, countries should put more. But the \"bully your way through\" is not ideal. Specially while talking to allies. I see Ukraine pretty much becoming annexed territory within the next two years because of this. And Russia is not exactly an ally. Could it be? Not while Putin is in charge. Cold war still is raging but in other fronts. \n\n11. True. I should have been clearer. But let's talk about the Haitian communities in legal status by asylum seekers. They have promised to deport them, regardless of the fact they are legally in the US. The muslim ban, I think, shouldn't be a concern now that the Arab axis has pretty much payed for their seat at the table in the WH.\n\nThanks for your response and your time.

It just annoys me, to say the least.\n\nThe EU countries have given Ukraine more aid than the US. It sometimes seems like less because their contributions are split between EU contributions and individual contributions.",
         "The USA benefits hugely from being a net exporter of national security. I don't mean hardware, but rather peace and deterrence benefits for our allies. This makes the USA an extremely safe investment, contributing to the massive strength of the US economy, US asset markets, and the US dollar being the global reserve currency.\n\n\nThe idea behind US military alliances in general is that the USA as the senior partner makes the largest investments and has the most influence over each of their allies individually. This means that they have to play by the rules set by the US, or risk being cast out in their own. The US is at the head of a decentralized machine that is much larger than they could afford to build themselves.\n\n\nIt's great that NATO allies are investing more in their own defense in line with their commitments, but this does not necessarily benefit the USA if the EU collectively\u00a0 becomes a true military equal to the USA. The reduced demand from allies for imported national security will correspondingly reduce US influence over global economic affairs, which will reduce US economic growth in the long term.",
         "Its called the peace dividend. With the fall of the Soviet Union, the major threat to NATO was dismantled more or less and so Europe collectively was able to downsize its military spending to focus on other spending. The US maintained its military as it is advantageous for us to be the lone super power of the world. We make a lot of money supplying countries with arms, we have influence on global affairs due to our global military reach, and we have trade partnerships built in part due to our ability to be a defensive partner.\n\nIt took a while for the West to realize that Russia was a problem (famous line from one of the Obama debates to the effect of how Russia being a threat was cold war thinking). Annexation of Crimea was a soft wakeup call and the rapidly growing relations between Ukraine, the US, and the EU made the invasion of Ukraine in 2022 a major wake up call that military production capacity and spending is a current day need.\n\nYour looking at the US \"protecting\" these nations is them exploiting the US but its the US being able to benefit from its big military that makes the US so influential and highly desired in geopolitics. Hiding in our turtle shell will only weaken the US and the power vacuum will be filled by some combination of Russia, China, and possibly the EU if it can further reinvigorate their military and/or potentially form an EU armed forces.\n\nAlso just to point out, the NATO spending rule is based on defense spending. Be it domestic manufacturing, maintaining troops, buying military hardware from other countries, etc. A lot of people make it seem like these countries are supposed to be paying dues to NATO or the US.\n\nAlso the EU collectively has given more than the US to Ukraine and also to reiterate that most of the stuff the US has given has been in the form of munitions and aging military hardware that has been sitting around in storage and would eventually need to be decommissioned which costs the US money to do. Giving aging munitions that most likely wouldn't be used outside of many training exercises has very little cost to the US except that we would then go ahead and make/buy new stuff to replace the old junk we sent off.",

I agree that she ran a strong campaign, but no amount of campaigning and media training can give her what she lacked completely: charisma\n\nWhen you look at the last 3 successful democrats \u2013 Biden, Obama, Clinton \u2013 they all had charisma. Looking at the last 2 unsuccessful ones, they didn\u2019t. That said, there are also some headwinds at play between men and women that make the charisma divide all that much more important. When most young men in particular are dealing with a loneliness epidemic and can\u2019t get dates, unfortunately i don\u2019t think now is the time to run a woman unless she really really knocks the electorates socks off \u2013 and Kamala wasn\u2019t that",

And yes, I call people that just got interested in politics after trump came around and have very little understanding of how politics and geopolitics actually work but feel very convinced by the right-wing propaganda machine misguided and naive. It\u2019s the fucking truth. \n\nYou can work with your child to correct bad behavior by pointing out blatantly bad and selfish behavior while also working with them to grow. You can work with coworkers to build stronger relationships despite differences. You can still be family with people you disagree with, set boundaries, and operate within those boundaries. Sure, yes. To all that. \n\nBut where the fuck does the idea come from that \u2018letting the republicans get away with what they\u2019ve done to our country over several decades is a good thing\u2019 come from? They\u2019re clearly worse. And the worst part of the Dems are 50% their traits and 25% left wing propaganda sourced from Russia. this is just insane.

         "\\> By the time Russia gets re equipped\u00a0\n\nThe Russian economy will never recover from where it is today. There is no \"re-equiped\" they are past the point of no return with their inflation issues. \n\nIsrael stayed out of the Ukraine conflict initially but I dont think it is going to be inclined to do so going forward. The fact that they turned a blind eye to the \"Wagner Group\" being so active in the region (actual Russian nazi's) was shocking but I suspect they saw the way the wind was blowing. Russian gold to Iran for arms. That gold then funds hezbola, Hamas, and Yemen. \n\nDont forget Yemen... The Saudi's (also Trump Friends) are almost ready to side with Israel against Iran because Russian missile tech is just a bit more than any one in the area wants them to have. Too bad Trump fucked the Iran Nuke deal where this would have been a non issue for the region...Ooops. \n\nNote: I do feel bad for Gaza but Egypt has been fighting on their side of the border (Siani) killing \"isis\" for the last 10 years and no one gave a shit about the death toll then. \n\nDoes Trump want deals in Israel (who has money) or does he want deals with Russians (who no longer have money). Between Bibi and the military industrial complex seeing the conflict ringing the cash register I dont think trump is going to \"stop\" anything. \n\n\\> The EU military group isn't as strong without the US\n\nThe French are rather pissed. First, Wagner pushed them out of their holdings in Africa (it's complicated). Second the French have already hinted that they would send \"trainers\" to Ukraine. The Russians response was NOT to say \"nukes\" rather to say \"they would be legitimate targets\" because the France is the only nuclear power who openly has a first strike doctrine. \n\nIF by some small miracle trump did pull off some sort of Russia deal, it's going to make tariffs directed at China \"tough\". Furthermore No one in the musk/thiel/Ventrue capital set is going to let him kill the cips act or back down Taiwan. The Xi Putin friction at that point is an \"incident\" waiting to happen... \n\nGaza/Israel is a diplomatic needle that the US was threading pretty well.

         "They don't have a Senate supermajority, which means they are still subject to the filibuster. And they will abuse the hell out of that fact. \n\nRepublican senators will draft bills that bundle economic reforms, tax breaks, and all manner of goodies alongside massive cuts to social services, research funding, regulatory bodies, and civil rights protections. Democrats will filibuster to prevent the horrible cuts. Republicans will point to the goodies being blocked and whine that Democrats clearly don't want to help ordinary people. Democrats will then make compromises to let some goodies through. And then when the consequences of the Republican cuts happen, the right wing media will claim that the Democrats' filibustering and/or legislative revisions were the cause. \n\nIt won't matter what the Democrat senators actually added or removed from the bills. It won't even matter if they ultimately made no changes at all. All that will matter is that the Democrats touched the bill in some way. The Republican politicians and right wing media have no problem outright lying to their audience, and the audience has no problem swallowing those lies. \n\nWe saw this when right wing politicians who voted against the infrastructure bill took credit for the funding it brought to their states. We saw this when Trump and Fox pinned all the blame for inflation on Biden, entirely ignoring the shrinking inflation rates since the pandemic.  We saw it with Republican politicians ranking the border bill while blaming Democrats for the  manufactured border crisis. \n\nAnd we'll see it again and again until low-info and right-wing voters begin to critically evaluate political claims and make an effort to learn even just the basics of civics and economics (in other words, we'll see it for the rest of our lives). As long as a Democrat is in the proximity of a political or economic problem, conservatives can convince a depressing number of voters that the Democrat caused it.",

Firstly kamala did nothing to get male voters I'm assuming most of the people who didn't vote were men. Obama was the last one who motivated men.\n\n\nKamala was weak on Israel. Most of us se them as the aggressor in the conflict but she took a soft stance.\n\n\nDiversity isn't an issue most people care about. They support lgbt rights but don't care if stuff has them.\n\n\n\nWhat left leaning voters want is universal health care, worker rights, pro unions, house reforms, more jobs, and environmental concerns. \n\nIf she ran on thoes I feel like she would have won",

Then the most predictable thing ever happens and Kamala has to take over and run a campaign in 3 months.  \n\nBut no democratic leaders had to continue to put shitty candidates in front of us and not give us an option. Bernie was the last democratic candidate I had a choice in, and they submarined him and took away my choice. \n\nMay be the last choice I ever get. I don\u2019t want to hear these people\u2019s opinions on shit.",

Help for small businesses, lower taxes for mid income folks, get rid of process gouging. All Trump did was complain about trans people and how he\u2019s going to get revenge on people who have wronged him. How did that sell to dumbass Boomers and Gen X\u2019rs?",

Working a job he hated to provide for us. The type of guy that owned two pairs of pants, his work jeans and nice jeans. Bought $5 pocket tees, etc. happily middle class meant things like cable and being able to take a vacation once a year.\n\nThings have become so skewed, I\u2019d blame much on social media and the fact it\u2019s designed to make people to feel empty and want more\u2026but that\u2019s its own rant. Guess point is, while I feel bad for those genuinely struggling, I also think  a lot of people have conflated the American dream with what they see on social media. Life is basically a reality show. And the bastardized view of that dream is being entitled to having everything you want with as little effort as possible. \n\nSorry for a bit of a rant, not sure how much that even makes sense, but I\u2019m sure like many, trying to convey thoughts somewhere like here is an attempt at some sort of catharsis",

         "For any students of history, Republicans used to be rather socially liberal and Democrats quite staunchly Conservative. Then in the Great Depression, FDR ran on a platform of social intervention and increasing government spending to help the working class, which literally flipped party ideologies because Republicans were backed by big businesses who did not want to fund increased government support via taxes.\n\nI bring this up because Democrats clearly have forgotten their roots, but also this leaves open the likelihood that after the administrative state is dismantled and nothing flows down to the working class, the next social upheaval will bring another turn (and likely restructure the Democratic Party or being up another Social Liberal-type party in its place. And depending on how hard MAGA clamps down on democracy, the upheaval will likely be delayed and will likely be larger when it happens. \n\nBut it's going to take some significant hardships to drive the next cycle.

I want the violence to stop as much as you do, but I\u2019m not willing to inflict greater harm on the entire country and the wider world because of a single issue.\n\nTo the voters who directly supported Trump, I condemn your ignorance. Instead of listening to Kamala and her realistic policy goals that were going to directly benefit the working class in this country, you opted instead to listen to Trump and his empty promises of \u201ceverything\u2019s gonna be the best it\u2019s ever been, like nobody\u2019s ever seen before\u201d bullshit.\n\nSeems like a majority of people in this country prefer to be fed lies about prosperity that will never happen rather than supporting a realistic path forward. The kind of change people really want and need will only happen when liberals can have control of all three branches of government for multiple consecutive presidential terms, not barely controlling one house of Congress and the Oval Office. \n\nInstead we get razor-thin majorities for 2-4 years at a time and then complain that Democrats never did anything for us, and withhold support for the next cycle. Republicans don\u2019t need to get anything done to keep their voters in line, they just obstruct any legislation that doesn\u2019t benefit them personally and tell their voters that it\u2019s somebody else\u2019s fault.",

Voters said Harris was too far to the left, not right, in polling.\n\nFor sure, voters have rejected the AOC type of progressives. But I don't know if they really want the Sanders type either.

They can always cite a recent story on Newsmax that focuses on illegal immigrants killing or raping a woman or a child. The week before the election, I was told about a Newsmax story on an illegal immigrant that raped a girl. Two weeks before that I was told how Democrats let a Venezuelan gang take over an apartment building in Colorado. \n   It\u2019s real hard to counter these stories with statistics that crime is down. Or for the Colorado story to point out it was an isolated incident. In my area there is a lot of petty crime and the Trump supporters always attribute it to illegal immigrants. They are very fearful. It\u2019s nearly impossible to eliminate crime but any criminal act is attributed to Democrats opening the border to criminals.",

I figure its time to go since I am so disgusted with my country, and they will likely be coming for me as an \"enemy within\" soon anyway.\n\nThe US absolutely deserves what is coming.  Watch over the next couple of years as people lose their health care, women are dying in parking lots as they bleed out from a lack of care, the military breaks down doors to arrest enemies, 11 million people are rounded up and deported, and public education sinks to the nether regions.  Watch as prices soar even more with tariffs, as Russia annexes Ukraine (then Poland and Moldova and others), watch us pull out of NATO and align with Russia.  Watch your gay and lesbian friends have their marriages annulled, and watch the trans community's suicide rate skyrocket.  Watch as the rest of the world figures out whether to laugh or cry at our self-inflicted demise.\n\n  \nJust remember, United States--you asked for it.  Good bye and good riddance.",

Anything that goes wrong or doesn\u2019t get done, it\u2019s basically on them.  \n\nI personally don\u2019t think they\u2019re up to it.  The people they have in office have gotten fat off of endless posturing that if only they could apply their vision and fulfill the values of their ideology we\u2019d have a better life, a better country.\n\nNow they\u2019re going to find out that it\u2019s no cakewalk to actually govern.

         "*For anyone who can't read it...*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**America Deserves Donald Trump. The World Doesn\u2019t.**\n\nThe president-elect has no philosophy or policy, and his incoherence about global relations is not feigned.\n\nNovember 6, 2024 at 8:25 AM EST\n\nBy Andreas Kluth\n\n\nIt\u2019s his world now.\n\nEvery country gets the government it deserves, it has been said, and America now gets a second administration led by Donald Trump. But the rest of the world did not vote in the US election. Does it deserve what comes next?\n\nAnd what exactly is that? The planet\u2019s most important relationship is arguably that between the world as a whole and its most powerful nation, even if it\u2019s no longer a superpower, hyperpower or \u201chegemon.\u201d That relationship, much more so than in Trump\u2019s first term, is now in flux, adrift, undefined.\n\nTrump campaigned on a vacuous premise that he will deliver peace through \u201cstrength\u201d without ever spelling out the sources or objectives of that strength. When he was president, he has bragged, \u201cWe didn\u2019t have countries fighting each other, they wouldn\u2019t have done it without my permission.\u201d What a joke.\n\nCome January, we\u2019ll find out if Trump\u2019s fellow strongmen ask for permission from his White House as they make their moves in geopolitics. Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin, with his KGB-trained mind, has always known how to flatter and manipulate Trump, and that\u2019s what worries Ukraine. China\u2019s Xi Jinping has taken note of Trump\u2019s inconsistent statements about Taiwan, and is ready to wage the trade war that Trump promises to launch.\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un already knows Trump from three summits and a brief exchange of \u201clove letters\u201d; as a direct result of that failed flirtation, he went full-bore in building nukes and missiles to threaten South Korea, Japan and the US. The mullahs in Iran probably do fear Trump \u2014 but they may now follow North Korea\u2019s strategy of self-protection with nuclear weapons.\n\nAmerica\u2019s allies, meanwhile, have no idea what\u2019s coming but fear the worst. Trump has, after all, threatened to pull out of NATO and to abandon partners if they don\u2019t buy enough chips or cars or steel from the US. Not least, anybody who cares about international law and the United Nations has reason to despair: Trump doesn\u2019t understand the UN as an institution or an idea, and he disdains what he doesn\u2019t understand.\n\nIt\u2019s become de rigueur among Washington\u2019s foreign-policy \u201cblob\u201d to affix \u201cisms\u201d to Trump\u2019s foreign-policy style, like MAGA buttons to lapels. He\u2019s a nationalist, they say, or an isolationist, mercantilist, realist, unilateralist, and so forth. All partially true \u2014 and all beside the point.\n\n\nThe person who has best captured the man\u2019s worldview is John Bolton, a notorious hawk who did a stint as Trump\u2019s national security adviser. The critical point is that Trump has \u201cneither philosophy nor policies,\u201d Bolton says. Trump\u2019s decisions on national security are entirely transactional, he writes, spread on the map like \u201can archipelago of dots, unconnected by chords of logic, salience or results.\u201d\n\nThe optimistic spin on Trump\u2019s approach is that it\u2019s a new and amped version of the \u201cmadman theory\u201d that was once attributed to Richard Nixon (although Machiavelli long ago suggested that it can indeed be a \u201cwise thing to simulate madness\u201d). By that logic, America\u2019s foes and friends alike will be docile out of sheer fear: What might this man do, with or without a nuclear button?\n\nBut the madman theory \u2014 never properly elaborated or tested \u2014 assumes a leader who has a compass and a mental map, and feigns occasional derangement tactically to navigate to his strategic destination. Trump has neither compass nor map. If his foreign policy seems incoherent bordering on mad, he may not be feigning. America could actually find itself adrift in his archipelago of dots, also called the world.",
         "Looking back at the years I spent in the US, there was a lot of cruelty and misery everywhere, and it\u2019s not surprising anymore that the country is going to shit.

         "\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 Today, there is no \u201cthey,\u201d only \u201cwe.\u201d We cling to that illusion of division like it\u2019s the last life raft, pretending we\u2019re not all slowly sinking into the same sea of chaos. Aren\u2019t we supposed to be Americans? Or is that just something we slap on the Fourth of July and forget about once the fireworks are over? As author and activist Arundhati Roy put it, \u201cThe war is not over; it is not even beginning; we are all in it.\u201d (Roy, Field Notes on Democracy, 2008). It\u2019s hard to pretend we\u2019re separate when we\u2019re all in the same sinking boat.\n\nAt some point, we sold our future for pocket change\u2014sacrificing any long-term hope for the shallow comfort of a few extra dollars today. A cheaper tank of gas, a little tax break, maybe even a handful of crumbs to make us feel like we\u2019ve won. And yet, most don\u2019t see how deep Project 2025 and those \u201cinnocent\u201d tariffs will cut into their lives. We\u2019ve become a nation so wrapped up in our own smugness, we\u2019re too distracted to notice the slow-motion disaster heading straight for us. As journalist Chris Hedges said, \u201cWe are a society that is on the edge of ruin, and the people are too distracted by the drama to notice.\u201d (Hedges, America: The Farewell Tour, 2018). The kicker? The ones who cheered it all on are going to be the first ones to feel the sting.\n\nIf this is MAGA\u2019s promised land, then sure\u2014bring on those falling prices, the affordable gas, the groceries that magically cost less. But my gut tells me that\u2019s about as likely as pigs flying. The idea that one person can \u201csave the economy\u201d while conveniently ignoring the rest of the world is almost adorable\u2014like watching a toddler believe that closing their eyes means they\u2019re invisible. As economist Joseph Stiglitz aptly noted, \u201cMarkets are global, and the idea that a single nation can somehow insulate itself from global forces is delusional.\u201d (Stiglitz, Globalization and Its Discontents Revisited, 2017).\n\nWhen the reckoning comes, at least we\u2019ll have the privilege of saying, \u201cwe told you so.\u201d Not that it\u2019ll make a difference. I can already hear the chorus of MAGA voices scrambling to point the finger at everyone else, even though they\u2019ve got the Senate, House, Supreme Court, and Presidency locked down. Watching them contort themselves to blame \u201cthe others\u201d when they\u2019re the only ones with their hands on the wheel will be an impressive spectacle\u2014if it weren\u2019t so painfully predictable. As political commentator Thomas Frank observed, \u201cBlaming the elites is a convenient way of not facing the reality that we, as a society, are complicit in this mess.\u201d (Frank, Listen, Liberal, 2016).\n\nThis country\u2019s moral compass is so broken, it\u2019s practically a modern art piece. We\u2019re hanging on by a thread, and any hope of a miraculous comeback feels like a bad joke. Whatever storm is coming, we rolled out the welcome mat. We earned it\u2014every dark, twisted moment of it. As historian Howard Zinn warned, \u201cThe problem is not that we are too few, but that we are too few who are willing to stand up.\u201d (Zinn, A People\u2019s History of the United States, 1980).  \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8",

Then you probably shouldn't make that a high priority issue when you vote.\" I don't think I changed his mind completely, but I got him to walk back a lot of things that he thought were fact but ended up being overblown or propaganda, and maybe helped him start the process of divorcing his politics from his identity.\n\nProblem is, I would have to have this same conversation with 20 million people in order to bring about substantial impact.",

         "We really need to teach economics as part of compulsory education. As someone with an economics degree, it was so frustrating to see people support Trump based on fundamental misunderstandings of how the economy works, especially the fact that the executive branch has very little impact on inflation if the Fed retains its historical independence, which was the case with the massive COVID monetary stimulus.\n\nAlso, if the Fed lost its independence and becomes beholden to the executive branch and starts adjusting interest rates to decrease inflation purely due to political concerns, say hello to the unemployment line! Adjusting interest rates and maintaining the appropriate balance between employment and inflation is delicate as hell, and we really don't need politics fucking that up all the time. That's how you end up like Venezuela or Argentina.\n\nAnd what's doubly frustrating is that the Fed wouldn't have had to respond so dramatically (or rather, for as long as it did) if Trump hadn't completely fucked up the federal response to COVID as badly as he did, meaning that inflation might not have been as bad if the Fed didn't have to maintain low interest rates for as long as it did. He literally failed upwards by getting reelected based on inflation.",

There is literally nothing stopping him from outright ending them on day one and pardoning himself (yes, a president can apparently pardon himself), killing any chance for a future prosecution.\n\nHe attempted a coup and is going to get away with it with exactly zero consequences. He brought this country to the brink with armed and organized militias storming the capitol building and attempting to send fake electors to change the outcome of an election he lost, and he'll face zero consequences for that. \n\nHe stole boxes of classified documents, hid them from people who rightfully came looking for them, and stored them in insecure locations (including a disused ballroom... with a photocopy machine right next to the trove of documents). He'll face zero consequences for that.\n\nHe has already been convicted for covering up his illegal interference in the 2016 election, but not sentenced. That's a state charge, so he can't pardon himself.

Of course illegal immigration happens in many different ways, but illegal \"border crossings\" should be completely shut down. I'm strongly in favor of legal immigration, but people entering the country must come through the legal means so that we can know that they mean us no harm and want to be in the country for the right reasons. Overstaying visas is of course another issue which isn't as easy to stop, but this leads into the next topic --\n\nOn mass deportation. I'd prefer it if Trump offers a path to illegal immigrants to receive legal status if they can show that they haven't committed crime (apart from when they entered the country in the first place) and are contributing to society. But they legally do not have any right to be here, so while it's not my first choice, he has every right to deport everyone who is here illegally if it comes to that. What absolutely MUST be stopped are violent criminals and gang members coming over to the United States. That should literally never happen - a single one is too many. Trump absolutely needs to deport everyone here illegally who commits any crime at all.\n\nI also hope that Trump offers easier pathways for legal immigration. The \"lottery\" system is absurd and unfair and I'd like to see the entire thing reworked and pathways opened up for much more legal immigration. But all of this is irrelevant until the illegal immigration problem is controlled first. We must secure the border and then look towards more comprehensive immigration reform. I hope Trump does these things, but overall if it's a question of \"completely open borders\" vs \"completely closed borders\", I'd have go to with closed. We cannot sustain this illegal immigration.\n\nOn FDA -- the only thing I dislike currently is how difficult it is to get more experimental treatment, specifically for terminal illness. FDA would sometimes rather have people just die rather than allow them to voluntarily take part in an experiment that could help them. It can take 12 years to get approval for these kinds of things. Too much red tape. But I don't feel strongly about this and it isn't really part of who I decide to vote for.\n\nACA - Don't care, they likely won't do anything either.\n\nMusk - Literally could not care less about Elon Musk.\n\nOn NATO -- I think many of our \"allies\" in NATO are nearly useless, or in some cases working against our interests. The only true reliable ally in terms of military force has been the UK who participates in shooting down missiles. France and some other countries are actively working to damage Israel who is our strongest partner in terms of cutting edge missile defense (something I care a lot about the US having. If the worst comes to pass, I hope we have the same or better missile defense systems as Israel does). I'm not in favor of disbanding NATO entirely but the status quo is no good. We should focus more on our allies who are legitimately interested in their own defense - Ukraine, Taiwan, Israel, and the UK. They are the only countries who currently have a proven track record of being reliable military partners. We should expand treaties with them and partner on advancing our defensive technology with them.\n\nOn Israel -- they need to reach peace with their neighbors as soon as possible, but sometimes peace is only possible when there is no alternative left to their enemies. For example: Egypt was one of the first countries to try to destroy Israel when it was founded, and then after being brutally defeated, Egypt negotiated peace with Israel because the alternative was destruction. Israel will have to completely disarm Palestine and kill all of HAMAS. After that, they can seek peace hopefully with the Palestinian Authority who is positioning themselves to be the moderates. But yes this will be painful for Palestine. Just like losing WW2 was painful for Nazi Germany and Japan. That doesn't mean it was wrong to win that war. Biden's strategy of playing both sides has just extended the war and made it even worse. If Biden supported Israel, maybe the war would even be over and Palestine would be on the path to recovery right now.",

The Biden administration dragged its feet, played politics with justice, and got stymied because they started the process too late.\n\nIt's the same with Ukraine.  The western world decided that rather than directly intervene and crush the Russian invasion, they would provide Ukraine just enough to survive so the fighting would drag on for years.  But now, most of that support will evaporate in a couple months, so Ukraine will likely no longer be able to hold out against the invasion.  When it could have been over by now if America had committed to defending Ukraine fully.\n\nStalling for maximum political effect is how all of this has happened.  Trump's primary opponents ignored him in 2016 as a joke candidate, until he defeated them all.  Hillary was happy to see him emerge as the nominee, thinking he'd be easy to defeat, but then she lost as well.

Nothing, lots of apathy, frustration, anger, especially Arab men, women at least would give me the 60 seconds to speak. I am very angry at this community and anyone who didn't vote Harris, period. It hurts extra when you have culture similarities and they don't trust you. But let me tell you, some or a lot of these people know a friend, family member, or friends friend that has been affected by israels atrocities in Gaza and Lebanon. I cannot just look past that even in my anger.\u00a0 Canvassing Dearborn, MI was one of the most emotionally taxing and \"dangerous\" political or social activities I did. Worst I got was some verbal spats, but never anything physical (thank goodness).\u00a0 I tried America. Writing this makes me almost wanna cry.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nP.s. the Dearborn office didn't open till last 3 weeks, apparently Harris campaign fought against it (possible lost cause, not sure? Reason), until some grassroots Muslim organizers pushed for it. I don't blame Harris for the decisions the campaign made, they did their best with the situation and time.",

         "Thats for people who aren't old yet to worry about, obviously, the people who are old now are in power. Same with social security benefits.",
         "Yes, but always remember *how* they're coming for it: the changes will only apply to those that are currently ~50 or younger, same with all the other programs they want to cut.",

         "He won\u2019t. The democrats are going to let the people suffer with the government they elected. What\u2019s Biden going to do? Flex his powers to go against the majority of the American people? This is literally what America wants and voted for. Who would he be doing it for?",
         "There would be a civil war within our country if we actually followed the same path as Nazi Germany. We have a much bigger population than they did.",
         "None of that matters for statewide races like president and senate. How many polls did we see that Allred was neck and neck, and he didn't even come close. You can't blame any of that on districting.",
         "Yeah and now that this stupid experiment didn't pan out,  all these libs want to scapegoat Muslims, Latinos, black men for 'voting against their interest'. These communities didn't turn their backs on dems, dems repeatedly shut the door on these communities.",
         "I'm never going to forget that white women heard Trump say he's going to \"protect them whether they like it or not\" and they said to themselves \"oh yes daddy,\" fuckin pathetic\u00a0",

         "From protesting Gaza to being bombed in Gaza. It's going to be a harsh reality for some.",
         "Here is a video asking Palestinians in the West Bank if they see LGBT people as allies. They all said no. The first guy in the video even says LGBT people are not human.

         "Same! Then them to Gaza while Trump lets Netanyahu rain hell. I'll make sure to ignore their screams like they ignored the screams of all lbgtq people.",
         "Look at it this way, will a wall prevent a plethora (no pun intended) of Conservative Catholics into the country who will get theirs, and then proceed to pull up the ladder after themselves and eventually vote republican once they gain citizenship? Kinda shitty to think that way, but like you said, it's time to cut losses on avenues that will close off eventually anyway. I know you didn't say that word-for-word, but I feel that's a close enough characterization of what you meant. And I think I agree.\n\nAside: I've been saying this for YEARS that Liberals need to have a come to Jesus about Islam. I get sticking up for the \"little\" guy, but that little guy has now bitten the hand that feeds more than once. So, yeah. Reckoning time, fellow libs!",

         "Critical thinking skills are at an all time low",
         "I got banned from a sub too for saying basic facts about Palestine. People don\u2019t want to see it, but there is a suppression of nuance and one side of voices when it comes to I/P. It happens on Reddit and on TikTok and has successfully brainwashed many young folks to the point where Greta Turnberg throws away the planet and tells people not to vote Kamala.",

         "Prison labor.  Where do you think all of these illegal immigrants are going to go while they're being \"processed\"...?",
         "Simple. \n\nThey'll round up the workforce into holding camps that just happen to be right by big factories and farms, and the bosses will merrily avail of the slavery.\n\nAs for those who manage to evade being flung into camps, the environment will be much more dangerou for them and so they'll be much easier for small factories and farms to exploit. The prospect of being caught and deported is a risk, but the risk of ending up in a concentration camp quite another.",
         "Oh, don't worry. I'm sure the responsible adults about to take over the Federal government will have no qualms about making medical debt something that can result in asset seizure.",
         "Yes exactly. I voted for Kamala, but as someone with many Muslim loved ones, they were othered throughout the election cycle. When you\u2019re blatantly disrespected by a certain party, and your family back home is probably going to be blown up by an air strike imminently that is being eagerly funded by the current ruling party, it becomes very difficult to want to vote for said party. Once they win and have your vote, it shows complacency and that they can treat your people like trash for the rest of your life and get away with it. Similar stories for a lot of the minority groups that are being called out. \n\nAgain, I voted for her because I\u2019m not a single party voter, but I can absolutely see why so many didn\u2019t want to hand democrats the victory and chose to sit out or vote third party or even Trump.",
         "I\u2019m glad to see someone saying this. The Uncommitted Movement literally begged the Harris Campaign to give Arab and Muslim Americans a reason to vote for her and they got spat on. Then they were scapegoated as if it was their fault for daring to raise the issue. They wanted her to win. They tried to warn the party this was a serious mistake, and the party gave them the fucking finger.\n\nSorry but any campaign who would treat their own base that way deserves to lose. At least Trump tells his people what they want to hear.",
         "Only way to fix this is to fire everyone from the Obama era onwards, start from scratch. You cannot salvage this party.",
         "It's the proverbial tree voting for the ax because the handle is made of wood.",
         "It\u2019s what they picked. Trump was already on the record as wanting to deport them, and wanting Israel to \u201cfinish the job.\u201d\n\nThis is what they chose. They decided that Gaza should be turned into a smoking crater. The least they can do is be there for the event that they made happen.",
         "I agree, even though I know I\u2019m not supposed to.\n\nEurope has been flirting with fascism for a while due to a significant influx of Islamic refugees. We aren\u2019t at the same point here, but I worry about it. I especially worry about losing votes in order to stick up for an incredibly conservative religion that is profoundly opposed to my own rights. What happened in Hamtramck is disgusting, and I\u2019m struggling to figure out why I\u2019m fighting to make this happen in more places.\n\nI wish it didn\u2019t have to be this way, but I\u2019m at my breaking point. If I have to choose between the rights of women and queer people, or taking in more immigrants who are opposed to the rights of women and queer people, I\u2019m choosing the former. I wish it didn\u2019t have to be a choice, but apparently it does.",
         "Redditors will downvote you when you point out the entire idea that LGBT+ people and and Muslims are somehow allies entirely and literally something out of Marxism - the idea is that all minorities are natural allies and should band together to overthrow the predominant hegemonic power in a society (WASPs in America). And we're not, in reality, actually allies in anything. On the global grand scheme of things Islam and Arab colonialism is just another hegemonic power that would destroy gay people and minorities.",
         "Wait, did Greta do this? I've been outta touch in the last week before the polls",
         "Yes, I believe Trump said \"finish the job\".\n\nSurely he was the better candidate for Palestinians.. /s",
         "Yep. *California*, of all places, voted against a measure that would ban forced prison labor. Soundly.",
         "Where will they go once their assets are seized? They\u2019ll land in nursing facilities. It\u2019s illegal for hospitals to discharge elderly patients with nowhere to go. So instead of them paying $3-$4k a month on assisted living from their savings they will be costing all of us $10-$12k a month on skilled nursing.",
         "Oh even better - they said that under Harris (not even Biden), that Gaza is already a smoking crater. So whatever Trump does, they\u2019ll just say Harris would\u2019ve been no better.\n\nSo anyway, I\u2019ve already been extremely anti-Trump, but I look forward to getting 18 holes in at the Trump Gaza Hotel and Resort in a few years.",
         "Yep",
         "Forgive me for being in maximum cynicism mode right now, but I imagine they'll end up in the same place that seniors who outlived their usefulness to TFG and crew during the worst of the COVID pandemic. \n\nI hope that's not the case, but there are too many parallels to early 1930's Germany for me to ignore.",
         "I\u2019m not sure why people don\u2019t get this. Just like the people who say 10M people cannot be deported. The lucky ones will be deported the remainder locked away or worse."

But Trump has been championing block tariffs, which always end up in dramatically raising consumer costs. \n\nThis is what many folks mean by the idea that voters will get what they deserve.

         "Trump has a long history of saying useless words then doing whatever he wants afterwards. Any claims about what Trump has said he \"plans\" to do aren't worth the electricity spent to spread them.\n\n\nThe only thing resembling a plan from the trump campaign is project 2025, and his own hateful rhetoric.\n\n\nThe Republican party wants to gut environmental regulations, a true tragedy for the generations that will get to deal with the fallout of climate change. During his last term he took steps to worsen climate change and keep America dependent on fossil fuels. During his last term he put children in literal cages, separated from their parents, then lost track of which child went with which parent, effectively orphaning tens of thousands of kids. I hope I don't need to express what an affront to humanity that is.\n\n\nDuring his last term he averages 21 verifiable lies every day. He's a narcissistic, small minded, bully that needed his name every few sentences in intelligence briefings or he'd get bored. He stored national secrets in a bathroom and sold them to the highest bidder. He presided over the biggest loss of American intelligence assets ever recorded. He disbanded the pandemic response unit, and then downplayed the inevitable pandemic, going so far as to recommend using horse dewormers and injecting bleach instead of practical solutions recommended by doctors.\n\n\nAnd that's just off the top of my head in a bullshit reddit comment, if I actually went through news reports from the 2016-2020 era I could write a 30 page annotated bibliography on all the horrible shit he has done, without spending a single breath on the horrible shit he's *said* he wants to do (since, you know, his word isn't worth the oxygen consumed to speak it).",
         "The problem with a pathological liar and narcissist is that it's hard to figure out when it's just talk or if it has something meaningful to it. However, it's easier to figure out the root; which is narcissism. It's all about what will make him look great. So from there, we can get an idea of what's actually important to him and what is all talk, and there's a third layer to it as well, but that's rather speculative. However, the real concern is whether he's lying or not. As stated, you can trace his cares and desires from recognizing how he wants to be viewed, which means he could go back on his word. He'll endorse anything as long as he can stamp his name on it, but will he truly follow his own words or not. Honestly, I don't believe there has been a great track record there, but we'll see. \n\nThe issues are mixed between the rhetoric and hateful tone in his speeches (basically talking about how smart and strong he is, own the libs, *insert non-white Dem presidential candidate name here* isn't who they say they are, more ego boosting, nonsense talk, some go to vitriol talking points and once a while a new one pops up, etc, etc, etc; and Project 2025 (Either a very dubious ploy or the possible 2025 republican playbook).\n\nThe main issues that are brought up concerning this presidency is mostly the fact that most of the extreme fans and voters of Trump or the maga movement tend to be misogynistic, racist, sexist, antagonistic, trans-phobic, bigtory, or all of the above. I can't say that all the people who voted for him are like this,  but I also can't say many on here won't look at a gift horse in the mouth for those that contributed to what could be end of women's health care, trans care, proper education, ACA, and more.\n\nCurrently, we don't know what this presidency will bring, but if it's anything to what Project 2025 proposed, it's going to be a very tough and turbulent time. And if any of the extreme language used during his campaign was more than just a bunch of talk, it could get really nasty.\n\nThat being said, we are practically playing a game of schrodinger's cat, and we won't know until it begins. However, the apathy isn't exactly unwarranted, and I understand the pessimism. With the entire government having a GOP majority in both the house and senate, the SCOTUS has most of the GOP chosen justices still in their respective benches, the unnerving idea of \"loyalty tests\" (this one is potentially terrifying if it happens).\n\nOverall, once the red engine starts up, we will see the truth (or lack thereof) culminating into either a hot mess, a well crafted destruction of democracy, or an special mix that's been cherry-picked from both with a side of crazy praises of authoritarian leaders and mudslinging any who he feels threatened by.",

He also threatened that the United States would \u201cgo its own way\u201d in 2019 if military spending from other NATO countries did not rise.\"\n\nIn private: \"Senior administration officials told The New York Times that several times over the course of 2018, Mr. Trump privately said he wanted to withdraw from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Current and former officials who support the alliance said they feared Mr. Trump could return to his threat as allied military spending continued to lag behind the goals the president had set.\n\nIn the days around a\u00a0tumultuous NATO summit meeting\u00a0last summer, they said, Mr. Trump told his top national security officials that he did not see the point of the military alliance, which he presented as a drain on the United States.\"\n\nOr perhaps more recently - his February 2024 rally in South Carolina, [per PBS](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/fact-checking-trumps-comments-urging-russia-to-invade-delinquent-nato-members)\n\n\"Speaking at a rally in Conway, South Carolina, Trump recalled how as president he told an unidentified NATO member that he would withhold U.S. help and \"encourage\" Russia to do as it wishes with allies that do not contribute enough to military spending.\n\n\"'You didn't pay?

President's have always had immunity!  It literally didn't change anything.  All theatrics to try and stoke fear.  Looks like it worked on you.  Republicans are so radical that two democrat presidential candidates joined our side (Tulsi ran in 2020 & RFK jr ran this year).  As well as Nicole Shanahan, Joe Rogan, Elon Musk, and millions of others.  Elon even voted for Joe Biden & would've personally benefited greatly from an EV mandate.

It's like they were all promised land in Cuba when the US finally takes over Cuba or something.\n\nFrom my extremely limited experience, I had a high school teacher whose family fled Cuba during the revolution and lost their property as a result. They were a White Ethnicity Cuban. They were the Democratic history teacher.\n\nI really wonder what their opinions are now. I feel like just with any displaced population that lost their property they really deep down want that property back. I think Cubans more so since they have been an enemy of the US for so long and these people have been here for 2-5 generations now. Republicans are bullish towards Cuba and perhaps they do believe they will be able to get their property back or something.\n\nOr is it Latino Americans generally that are trending Republican? Florida Cubans were certainly the first group that jumped on board that train.\n\nLatino Women are still Democratic compared to White Women who are solidly in the middle.  But Latin Men are almost a core block of Republican support, if a Woman is on the top of the Democratic Ticket. So what is it that Democrats offer with a man on the top of the ticket compared to a woman? Democrats need to ask Latino men this directly. I almost feel like Kamala Harris should still be out there doing town halls with white women and Latino men to find out what their beef is.\n\nBut Florida is lost, unless the Democrats just flip and become bullish on Cuba too. Democrats got ahead of themselves by trying to end the embargo during the Obama years. If Democrats want to have any chance in Florida they have to offer something to the Florida Cubans in regards to Cuba. I don't know exactly what it is that the Florida GOP offers but the Democrats just need to be bullish on Cuba now. They need to be more bullish on immigration in general. It isn't a winning battle to try to solve immigration the Bush way at they have been. The Republicans basically want the states to have control of the immigration at the border, and effectively border security itself. So what is the alternative that Democrats can offer that isn't that or closing the border? Or should the Democrats just offer that.

I say that for every person. Relax on that thinking a little bit. \n\n6 weeks is essentially a ban on elective abortions. I support that personally. I disagree with abortions outside of the medical, rape, incest. \n\nYou can cite one instance. Possibly 2 or 3 and every one of those are sad to hear. But that is not commonplace and you know it. We are arguing that you are upset because you believe Trump is eliminating abortions all together. I\u2019m informing you that is not true and giving you solutions to your \u201cproblems\u201d and yet you still argue. \n\nStates have different laws. Some we agree with. Some we don\u2019t. That\u2019s just how it goes. You have options if you truly want to get an abortion. \n\nDid I not say that Trump is pro-abortion for rape, incest, and medical ? No I don\u2019t think a person should carry their rapists child. But again, as I\u2019ve stated several times, the flight / drive to a state that does allow abortion for those reasons is worth it. \n\nWe are talking only medical / rape / incest. Because otherwise I\u2019m pro-life. We will wholeheartedly disagree on that and that\u2019s fine. I won\u2019t look at you negatively because you disagree with me.
