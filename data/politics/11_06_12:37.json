Now, after his second win, it\u2019s increasingly difficult to believe he represents merely a small, furious faction of extremists. Consequently, my faith in the American people has dwindled. Twice, we have placed a bigot, a racist, and a sexual predator in the highest office in the land. His decisions carry weight for nearly everyone on this planet. For another four years, urgent matters like the Climate Crisis, the situation in Ukraine, the conflicts in the Middle East, and tensions with Taiwan will be sidelined or, at worst, exacerbated. Dictators will gain confidence, and racists, extremists, and misogynists will feel empowered. The repercussions for our nation and for global peace and stability will be devastating. This isn\u2019t a mistake; it\u2019s not an accident, nor is there any innocence involved. You are aware of who he is and what he stands for, yet you have chosen him as your leader.

In my mind you\u2019re an acquaintance at best now. I will not travel there with Trump in power.\n\nSo good luck with isolating yourself from the rest of your world/partnering with Russia. \n\nI also suspect there will be a civil war at some point given 49 percent of you did not ask for this. For those people, I am sorry. I hope you find peace again. To the rest of you, I\u2019m just - so disappointed in you. \n\nMaybe one day you\u2019ll pick up the pieces and rebuild. Maybe those 51% of you need to learn the hard way. I just hope you can get out of the mess you made once you realize it. It\u2019s doubtful though.",

And that\u2019s just the musk/twitter part of the misinformation/ interference campaign.\n\nIt\u2019s so weird that everyone is just accepting the result like it was a fair fight.

They listened and made Kamala the nominee. People wanted Kamala and she was clearly the best choice. \n\n\\-Kamala made a GREAT VP pick in Walz. His debate performance albeit was not the best, but Shapiro would have alienated pro-Palestine supporters even more and Walz appealed to progressives.\n\n\\-Within the short amount of time, Kamala had GREAT momentum. She made people forget about Trump's assassination attempt and energized voters like the base has never seen. \n\nI think they did all they could do, but they are no match for American stupidity.

         "*For anyone who can't read it...*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**America Deserves Donald Trump. The World Doesn\u2019t.**\n\nThe president-elect has no philosophy or policy, and his incoherence about global relations is not feigned.\n\nNovember 6, 2024 at 8:25 AM EST\n\nBy Andreas Kluth\n\n\nIt\u2019s his world now.\n\nEvery country gets the government it deserves, it has been said, and America now gets a second administration led by Donald Trump. But the rest of the world did not vote in the US election. Does it deserve what comes next?\n\nAnd what exactly is that? The planet\u2019s most important relationship is arguably that between the world as a whole and its most powerful nation, even if it\u2019s no longer a superpower, hyperpower or \u201chegemon.\u201d That relationship, much more so than in Trump\u2019s first term, is now in flux, adrift, undefined.\n\nTrump campaigned on a vacuous premise that he will deliver peace through \u201cstrength\u201d without ever spelling out the sources or objectives of that strength. When he was president, he has bragged, \u201cWe didn\u2019t have countries fighting each other, they wouldn\u2019t have done it without my permission.\u201d What a joke.\n\nCome January, we\u2019ll find out if Trump\u2019s fellow strongmen ask for permission from his White House as they make their moves in geopolitics. Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin, with his KGB-trained mind, has always known how to flatter and manipulate Trump, and that\u2019s what worries Ukraine. China\u2019s Xi Jinping has taken note of Trump\u2019s inconsistent statements about Taiwan, and is ready to wage the trade war that Trump promises to launch.\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un already knows Trump from three summits and a brief exchange of \u201clove letters\u201d; as a direct result of that failed flirtation, he went full-bore in building nukes and missiles to threaten South Korea, Japan and the US. The mullahs in Iran probably do fear Trump \u2014 but they may now follow North Korea\u2019s strategy of self-protection with nuclear weapons.\n\nAmerica\u2019s allies, meanwhile, have no idea what\u2019s coming but fear the worst. Trump has, after all, threatened to pull out of NATO and to abandon partners if they don\u2019t buy enough chips or cars or steel from the US. Not least, anybody who cares about international law and the United Nations has reason to despair: Trump doesn\u2019t understand the UN as an institution or an idea, and he disdains what he doesn\u2019t understand.\n\nIt\u2019s become de rigueur among Washington\u2019s foreign-policy \u201cblob\u201d to affix \u201cisms\u201d to Trump\u2019s foreign-policy style, like MAGA buttons to lapels. He\u2019s a nationalist, they say, or an isolationist, mercantilist, realist, unilateralist, and so forth. All partially true \u2014 and all beside the point.\n\n\nThe person who has best captured the man\u2019s worldview is John Bolton, a notorious hawk who did a stint as Trump\u2019s national security adviser. The critical point is that Trump has \u201cneither philosophy nor policies,\u201d Bolton says. Trump\u2019s decisions on national security are entirely transactional, he writes, spread on the map like \u201can archipelago of dots, unconnected by chords of logic, salience or results.\u201d\n\nThe optimistic spin on Trump\u2019s approach is that it\u2019s a new and amped version of the \u201cmadman theory\u201d that was once attributed to Richard Nixon (although Machiavelli long ago suggested that it can indeed be a \u201cwise thing to simulate madness\u201d). By that logic, America\u2019s foes and friends alike will be docile out of sheer fear: What might this man do, with or without a nuclear button?\n\nBut the madman theory \u2014 never properly elaborated or tested \u2014 assumes a leader who has a compass and a mental map, and feigns occasional derangement tactically to navigate to his strategic destination. Trump has neither compass nor map. If his foreign policy seems incoherent bordering on mad, he may not be feigning. America could actually find itself adrift in his archipelago of dots, also called the world.",

Belief in evolution increased and monotheism decreased, and then two things happened.  \n\n1.  The monotheists withdrew into their echo chambers. Dissent became viewed as hostility, and it allowed them to adopt a persecution complex, which timed nicely with the entire victimclout mentality of social media.  \n\n2. Atheists became viewed as \"well actually\" insufferable nerds, despite being right. What it really bumped up against is the notion that in any social interaction, facts don't matter.  How do people take it when you come in and smugly tell them astrology, reiki, crystals, or God is bullshit? You come off like this wet blanket here to yuck someone's yum.  \n\nSo how does this manifest politically? When someone starts talking about the macroeconomic ramifications of tariffs on the global supply chain, everyone's already going to be bored. The guy who says \"shut up nerd\" will get a laugh, despite the issue being a complex and important one. Trump doesn't know how tariffs work, and his supporters don't care. They don't have to.",
         "Imagine a black mirror episode where these feckless idiots have their tariff tax applied to everything they buy, are denied healthcare, and then they start stomping their feet because life didn't get any easier for them, only to realise it was their signature on the cheque to the billionaires that told them to curl up and die.",
         "That's what infuriates me the most. People just stayed home. They deserved what's coming. My daughters don't...",
         "It\u2019s not Trump we\u2019re worried about, but the more competent group of people interested in repressing civil rights and corrupt group of people interested in-somehow-giving corporations even more power, are about to have a long term lease on America.",
         "Bingo",
         "Yep, this happened twice and and he's won against 2 women.\u00a0 Unfortunately we have to put pushing women as president on hold for a long time until we can take back power.\u00a0 How we're going to do that I have no idea, but its 100 % fact we can't put another women or minority in for the next election. We Can't take the chances with whats a stake now.\u00a0",

         "It\u2019s actually the playbook of most autocrats. Trump lost so he sowed seeds of doubt about election integrity. Add in MSM and both sides arguments and you\u2019ve convinced a large cohort of people into not voting.  It\u2019s been a plan all along and had the vote not gone their way they would be screaming about fraudulent votes.",
         "He hasn't won the house yet, actually. IDK why people are saying he has, voting doesn't end till Monday.\n\nMost polls show that it'll probably be a Dem House, some as high as 226, most around 219 (Dem)-216.\n\nConsolation prize, but it's something, I guess.",
         "I\u2019m so tired of complacent self-righteous lefties",
         "Trump did increase his turnout in key demographics.\n\nLet\u2019s not pretend Republicans turned out at the same rate as 2020. They didn\u2019t either. Trump did better with minorities this time.",
         "Honestly....    \nThe DEM party has been walking eyes wide off this cliff for years.   \nSome of us have been saying this since 2016, maybe now the party will listen?   \nLOL. Just kidding. I'm sure we'll be back in 2028 with another slightly less conservative conservative candidate that the DEMs will claim is \"super progressive\".",
         "We have to abandon the idea of democrat intellectualism or having the intellectual high ground.  You can say Republicans are evil, immoral, backwards and all this other, but you didnt do anything to try and stop it. Its the truest since of entitlement to think that you just get your way without offering anything. \n\nNumbers dont lie. So many people that could have voted didnt. Any argument beyond that is irrelevant. This isnt to say that the result wouldnt have been different. America has made its choice. If you are unhappy with it, you have a responsibility to vote every election even if your chosen candidate doesnt win, you are in a deeply X colored state, or you dont 100% align with everything that candidate says.",
         "No we did and that\u2019s what was frustrating. I felt like fucking Cassandra.\n\nAnyone who said it was going to be anything besides a landslide- or at least a win- for Kamala was downvoted to hell for being a \u201cdoomer\u201d. People thought I was insane that it felt like 2016.\n\nBut to me the writing has been on the wall since 2020. It took Covid and the fucking economy freefalling to beat the Trump cult. I just didn\u2019t see how, if he ran, we could beat him. American voters have a short memory.",
         "True... But what's the solution? \n\nIt's all over social media. So many big name celebrities are shouting from the roof tops about it... \n\nThere are efforts each cycle. People need to care for those efforts to catch on.",
         "There is literally nothing a candidate can do for that level of apathy other than bribes.",
         "You can't. They won't talk to you, they don't like your ads, they won't do any research, etc.\n\nThe fact that searches spiked for \"Did Joe Biden drop out\" during the election shows a lot of people aren't tuned in. I'll bet people walked into that booth and got confused that it wasn't Biden/Trump.",
         "This. Kamala had energy and drive and policy's that actually help people and were very centralized and she was against a massively unpopular candidate and she still lost. It's time to say that America is inherently sexist.",
         "Democrats need to put a younger, straight, white man out in front of the public next election if they want any hope of winning. It would be nice to be able to elect a woman president, but 2016 and 2024 both have clearly shown that's just not going to fly in America anytime soon.",
         "yes. it is. we have to run white candidates at the top, for the next 20 years at least. Latinos have been convinced they're white so they're not reliably on board with social justice.we have to take a hard line against immigration as well. without those things, Dems will nearly always fail. \n\nthese are hard truths, but truths nonetheless.",
         "> Hopefully this isn't just signs of a cycle we're doomed to fall into. \n\nI think at this point we're past hope, and are into the confirmation stage.\n\nI just hope that, since wildcards are possible, the blue states in the US, who actually pay for the US while red states take, realize that they have power through controlling the purse strings. They could organize and force changes now, recognizing the danger and knowing that history says the longer the wait the worse it will be.",

         "This is the way it happens. On the ground Maga whips up the far left into crazy talk, then to retaliate they start stripping rights and citizenship from people then gifting our shit to more deserving, \"family friendly\" people into your old house. Nazis did that and there having dandy luck lately with the Nazi thing. \n\nI did see it coming",
         "Yes, this is what I fear. The UK has been in a downward economic spiral for a decade and if you have spent any time there before and after you realize how bleak the picture is there for a sizable portion of the population. I\u2019m foreseeing a similar decade or more of slow economic stagnation and slowly crumbling power on the global economic stage. \n\nI\u2019ve spent the last few hours this morning wondering what to do with my savings and retirement to offset the next years of crumbling empire",
         "Her sex probably played the biggest role in it TBH, race maybe a secondary factor.  Trump didnt get more votes (i dont think then 2020) but Harris has something along the lines of 10 million less then Biden had.",
         "Also the media directed at younger men in particular was very effective at sanewashing Trump. Lots of comedians also feigning both-sidesism were influential, along with the popular podcasters. In the end, it's low information voters and lack of turnout that led to this. Hope all those guys enjoy paying child support and watching their wives/girlfriends/daughters die due to the end of reproductive freedoms and respect across genders in this society.",
         "Trump wanted to use the military on protestors. Sane people in his administration stopped him. There may not be any sane people in the room this time. We will probably see an armed response to protestors during his administration.",

         "Hispanic men have many a whack from la chancla in their future",
         "It\u2019s hard to fight it too because you have to be an actual expert on both the facts and on whatever spin they\u2019ve been spoonfed to repeat over and over, because it\u2019s crafted in a way that\u2019s impossible to disprove without completely tearing down their worldview, which won\u2019t happen.",
         "> Trump doesn't know how tariffs work, and his supporters don't care. They don't have to.\n\nPerhaps worst of all, media publications like the New York Times don't know how tariffs work either, and when an \"authority\" peddles complete misinformation about how tariffs work, what do you expect to see happen? \"The NY Times reported this, it must be true.\"",
         "Except, in reality, once all of it blows up in their faces, they'll just blame it on the liberals, Mexicans, LGBTQ's, or whichever scapegoat is in fashion at the time.",
         "Trump will just tell them actually the economy and healthcare are doing amazing and they'll immediately believe it.",
         "Yeah but the fact such an outrageous character who on paper is representation of old white money and privilege above competency and qualification can climb to the top of the totem pole TWICE in the largest western country in the world shows something is inherently wrong with how the US operates.\n\nI honestly don\u2019t think America will ever be able to recover globally. You have a horse in the building and everyone has seen it.",
         "Yeah last time trump walked into the WH without a gameplan and a lot got stalled through his own incompetence. This time there are a bunch of yes men around him with a very clear plan. Oligarchs are going to be eating good in America and minorities are going to get fucked.",
         "I hate to be so pessimistic, but I don't believe there's anything we can now do to prevent the ultimate decline of the US. Our international standing will not recover. Foreign policy is everything, and Trump is going to torch the system. We could subsequently elect 5 Democratic presidents in a row and it won't prevent Europe and other allies from continuing to cut ties and form new allegiances that minimize reliance on us, and hence, our influence and prestige, impacting everything.",

         "That's the problem is people don't know/care. Maybe this should have been a part of Harris message? Even if it was people don't understand. You need to sell them on ways you're going to improve their lives immediately.",
         "I am a leftist and im also exhausted with the hyper-moralism and purity testing; we are obviously trying to hang on to the simplest outline of democracy here; we have to prioritize for fucking survival here.\n\nThat being said, proper leftists basically cant be the main party of blame, just statistically, there arent very many in the swing states.\n\nThe truth is there is \"no main party of blame\". lack of turnout comes from lack of enthusiasm which is large and complex and not easily provoked.",
         "b-but, we weren't going to get ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING WE WANTED with Kamala, so might as well let the nazi win!",
         "The real dipshittery is that the \"low prices\" that Trump stumped on were \"IT'S THIS LOW BECAUSE OF A FUCKING PANDEMIC AND STAY AT HOME ORDERS\".  He had low prices because the economy was on the verge of collapse.  And we economically paid for keeping the economy afloat during '20 and '21 by the rampant inflation to catch back up to the mass quantities of money printed.  \n\nLike gas was $2, because nobody could drive anywhere in mass quantities.",
         "Bro I got banned to oblivion and none of my comments were even bad. It's wild.

Celebs mean nothing because they don\u2019t experience the same lives. \n\nPeople in this country were coddled. Now they are going to pay for not being able to deal with reality.",
         "Idk they could try courting the left and progressives, instead of just assuming they\u2019ll fall in line. That assumption didn\u2019t work in 2016 and it clearly didn\u2019t work now. I genuinely don\u2019t understand how anybody could\u2019ve thought trotting out the fucking Cheneys, who aren\u2019t even that popular with moderate republicans, was ever going to make up for the people they were alienating with Harris\u2019 stances on Gaza, or turning away from the green new deal, or dems just fully abandoning universal healthcare.",

         "It's why Trump is so effective. Just completely shamelessly lies and says whatever people want to hear. He has zero consistency or belief behind it because it doesn't matter. Basically 120 million americans have already made up their minds so no matter what, they're voting how they vote Then you have about 50 million \"swing voters\" who apparently get amnesia every 4 years and crawl out from under a rock and go \"Oh I thought the president was Biden.\" Then it's just a random ass guess what 3 snippets of information they hear before casting their vote.\n\nSeriously there was an interview done with an undecided voter and here was her thoughts:\n\n\"Well Harris is pro-choice which I like. Trump wants to legalize weed which I like. I don't know who I'll pick...\"\n\nI just.... I just... /sigh.",

         "I had an opportunity to have an extended conversation with a deep Trumper, and I was actually able to make some headway with him. I seem to have lifted him up out of some extremist values by asking him things like \"can you actually see any negative impact on your life because of Biden's border policy? No? Then you probably shouldn't make that a high priority issue when you vote.\" I don't think I changed his mind completely, but I got him to walk back a lot of things that he thought were fact but ended up being overblown or propaganda, and maybe helped him start the process of divorcing his politics from his identity.\n\nProblem is, I would have to have this same conversation with 20 million people in order to bring about substantial impact.",

         "I mean - can you imagine working your ass off as a government with the headwinds of republicans telling the world Out Loud: We don't want democrats achieving anything even if it's good because it will hurt Trump's reelection even though he's a traitor and a felon\".\n\nAnd then losing the popular vote to the felon.",

         "We really need to teach economics as part of compulsory education. As someone with an economics degree, it was so frustrating to see people support Trump based on fundamental misunderstandings of how the economy works, especially the fact that the executive branch has very little impact on inflation if the Fed retains its historical independence, which was the case with the massive COVID monetary stimulus.\n\nAlso, if the Fed lost its independence and becomes beholden to the executive branch and starts adjusting interest rates to decrease inflation purely due to political concerns, say hello to the unemployment line! Adjusting interest rates and maintaining the appropriate balance between employment and inflation is delicate as hell, and we really don't need politics fucking that up all the time. That's how you end up like Venezuela or Argentina.\n\nAnd what's doubly frustrating is that the Fed wouldn't have had to respond so dramatically (or rather, for as long as it did) if Trump hadn't completely fucked up the federal response to COVID as badly as he did, meaning that inflation might not have been as bad if the Fed didn't have to maintain low interest rates for as long as it did.

That wasn\u2019t going to do much of anything for anyone who had already made up their minds or who was deciding to vote.  \n\nI think (and they\u2019ve shown) that the democrats are terrified to put their foot down. You gave a great example with the rail workers strike\u2026just give them their money. When I talk to people my age (24) about this either they don\u2019t know that strikes or really any other issue is going on or what they do know is just surface level and/or straight up wrong. It\u2019s like people in general just refuse to form an opinion that they\u2019ve actually researched. Gen Z as a whole does not understand that politics is work and progress takes time nor do my generation have the sense of urgency and dread the older generations have bc of actually going through shit. \n\nAnother thing that I thought about after a conversation with a millennial coworker is that the social issues that are being pushed by the dem party, may have turned off people en mass because they feel like it\u2019s detracting from real issues. Not to mention, Harris running as a moderate also probably drove people to stay home especially with what\u2019s happening in Gaza, Ukraine, Sudan, and the Congo. Bc most of Gen Z hasn\u2019t experienced any politically driven hardship (aka getting their civil rights taken away), I\u2019ve noticed that we tend to be more moralistic, stubborn, and righteous which does nothing when one needs to build a coalition which the republicans have but the democrats do not. \n\nI\u2019m just tired.",

That's why the rest of us were shouting from the rooftops that this was a stupid strategy. \n\nLong-time Democrat voters remember all the shit the ousted Republicans did.

Whatever.\n\nThe fact that these delusions are so blatant this time around just lends credence to the theory. People turned out for Biden but not Harris. They're as close as the same as it gets. Except for her gender and race...\n\nAnd just anecdotally. People will do anything to mental gymnastics away sexism. A lot of guys straight up get offended when you imply women have problems in this country? It's crazy. I guess they see it as the suffering olympics. For example I'll talk about how women have worse outcomes in medicine, how doctors STATISTICALLY believe women less often... and men will deny doctors have a problem. Even though the statistics prove there is sexism in medicine. They don't want to believe it. They say \"well I had a doctor dismiss me once, so it's not a gender thing.\" Not understanding what \"statistically more likely\" means. It's frustrating. Sexism is real and we can't even talk about it half the time because so many people will make 5000 excuses before considering hey yeah, maybe there's enough sexist people in the US to make a difference in the election?",

He's going to get about the same or less than 2020. That was honest to god a very beatable total. It's a damning repetition of 2014, where not enough people cared to listen to basic facts and stop the worst from happening. Where Democratic leaning people who knew better decided to be angry and cynical more than listen to their better nature. Trump's base didn't change much, About 40% of the nation chose to not care about it at all.\n\nHarris did very little wrong. The Dem activists who campaigned for her did very little wrong. Social media is already a mess of people blaming one another, arguing over the middle east, race, gender all of it, and I've shared both progressive and \"moderate\" views on all these issues throughout my life.\n\nBut in the end, I feel like more than half of people just willingly killed their empathy.

Latinos align with the very people who are racist against them.\n\nIt took Geraldo Rivera to actually see the racism in person, just last week, to turn against Trump, a day late and a dollar short.\n\nOf course it's no surprise, but there is the irony of the self-inflicted wound. Trump, and 90% of his followers, will always hate anyone who doesn't have blue eyes. But they still want your vote. But they will harass Latinos at every opportunity at traffic stops, at grocery stores, walking down the streets, etc. Trump will continue to empower this kind of racism.

But what about what's happening HERE in YOUR country? It's like they don't even give a fuck or realise that they just helped elect an authoritarian dictator who would not only *obliterate* Gaza with Netanyahu (and with glee I will add), they just ushered in an era of fascism here in the US. And the ironic thing is that there is an overlap between antifascists, people who had in the past argued against ICE concentration camps for migrants, support for Black Lives. Yet these same people were more concerned with Gaza that they just fucked over all these groups here at home in their own fucking country, AS WELL as signing a death warrant for *actual* genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.

It's not that it wasn't always a close race but I don't get the wild margins Trump is winning by. Millions of votes in FL and TX and hundreds of thousands in other places, making up huge margin gains in New York. It's like Trump magically gained 10% of the population's vote despite the insurrection, the felonies, and everything else.\n\nI had more faith in our country but history is doomed to repeat itself. This is going to be an election with ripple effects for a generation.\n\nEdit: There was no magic 10%. Trump performed just as he did in 2020. It was the Democratic vote that didn't show up by the millions. That should be a wake up call that Democrats didn't have the pulse of the nation and Harris didn't have the support we were led to believe.

The doctrine required broadcasters to provide fair coverage of all sides of a public issue. It was officially abolished by the FCC in 1987.\n\n2) Permitting corporate funding of political candidates, the landmark Supreme Court case Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission in 2010 significantly changed the landscape of campaign finance in the United States. The Court ruled that corporate funding of independent political broadcasts in candidate elections cannot be limited under the First Amendment. This decision effectively allowed corporations and unions to spend unlimited amounts of money on political campaigns, leading to the rise of Super PACs (Political Action Committees).\n\nI would add a third important decision by the Supreme Court helped to chip away at democracy and pave way to autocracy.

And this just proves that most of America is exactly what we are fighting against and there is a level of apathy in the non-voting population that does not care one bit. \n\nThat said, there are a few ways I will conduct my business to make it harder for the coming oligarchy to reign; for starters, delete Twitter.  Just don't give that platform any ad revenue. Tank its user base and let those corporations find some place else to go. Elmo does not need more help than he can get.  \n\nHoard money.  Just save as much money as you can. Buy local, buy used when applicable, learn to do things yourself as much as possible.\n\nTake care of your health.  Eat right and exercise.\n\nWe don't know how much fuckery the right is going to do to elections going forward, but if you can move from a red state to a swing state, maybe try for that, but if you truly feel vulnerable and can manage it, move to a blue state.  The issue with moving from a red to a blue state is it further stratifies the divide between how many red states there are versus blue states which then sends more power to the Senate towards the republicans. There are far more red states than blue states.\n\nLastly, just love your loved ones. Hold them and protect them.  Cherish all the good times you will have going forward, and yes, even amongst the coming misery, there will be good times as well. Value those moments. This malaise will last for a bit, but eventually you will recenter yourself. So don't lose hope, stay active with friends and family, and take the positives when you can.",

Our main benefit over other nations seems to just be that we're on a continent that's difficult to invade that is resource rich.\n\nKnow how everyone is real worried about climate change right now?  The US has topped the charts for worst GHG emitters per capita on the planet for the past 150 years straight.  We are the world's foremost cause of climate change.  But we Americans are better than the rest of the world, we're exceptional, which is why we've all decided to give up flying for vacations, give up driving SUVS, and we all agreed to limit our HVAC and hot water use to what's tolerable rather than what's perfect.  Oh and we've all limited our consumption of beef of course!\n\nWait... we've all done those things right?  It's not just me?  Nah, the vast majority of us have done absolutely none of those things because we're Americans, exceptional Americans!  We're the best.  We're the good.\n\nHow about modern wars since WWII?  Vietnam.  Korean.  Iraq.  Afghanistan.  Ukraine.  Israel/Gaza (a genocide, not a war).  The US has either directly taken part in these, or has at least had their hands in all of them.  We're exceptional at war and killing.  Our military spending is more than the next 10 largest military spending nations!\n\nWe also have a long history of foreign regime changes to those who are more willing to support our bid to mine / buy their resources... can't forget about that!\n\nOh right right, it's not our international or planetary policy that makes us exceptional... it's our social policy!  A history of slavery and civil rights violations, but that's in the past.  We're not currently still dealing with racism, sexism, homophobia, xenophobia, and sexism!  We're far too exceptional for that. /s  \n\nWhen Democrats, the party of good, had a super majority, the last time being in 2009 during Obama, they couldn't be bothered with codifying abortion rights, or real single payer universal healthcare, or reparations for ancestors of slaves, or immigration policy, or even helping the little guy instead of corporations during a recession.  They did pass Obamacare real fast though, which seems to have done almost nothing to control our healthcare costs that are among the highest in the world.\n\nHow about this election... it seems we've elected Trump again, a geriatric convicted felon, rapist, fraud businessman who in his last term attempted to lead an insurrection and destroy US Democracy, and whom his own administration cabinet doesn't support.  Funny enough, as far as I can tell, many of his supporters don't even care about politics or know anything about actual policy... many are literally just voting for him to troll the US and the liberals / establishment / elite.  They're upset, they're angry, and they want to own the libs / establishment.  That's the extent of it of their justification for voting Trump.  That's a sign of being exceptional, FYI...\n\nOh right, Democracy... THAT's what truly makes us exceptional.  Except that the electoral college is clearly corrupt, and our winner take all system is also easily corrupted to give results that aren't representative of the voter demographics, whether districts are gerrymandered or not.  Other nations do representation far better than us, where every vote truly matters.  In the US, if your district votes 50.01% to 49.99%, and you're on the 49.99% side, your vote automatically gets counted as going to the other candidate as if you supported and voted for them and their policies.  Isn't that nice everyone?!\n\nMeanwhile, those people who fight against the two party system, and for real change, or stand up to a given party and demand changes, they're listed as the problem by the status quo voters.  Those that have continuously voted for the status quo, leading to the US largely stagnating in social policy while our politicians fleece us financially by passing every policy the corporations and super wealthy want them too, they're the folks who are clearly the most exceptional.\n\nI get it, I see why Jon wants to push a message of hope... but his message of hope is based on the misguided idea that the US is actually exceptional.  It's not.  If anything, the US has been a virus on this planet... completely engulfed by personal greed and a capitalistic system that has us living outside of the bounds of what this planet and its life and people can sustain.  If we're exceptional at anything, it's exceptional at taking and destroying.\n\n....\n\nNow get on those planes without a second thought and go on vacation all of you and emit those truckloads of CO2 into the atmosphere... because we deserve it for being so GD exceptional!",

I could understand voting for Trump in 2016, it was an FU to politics and politicians by a people struggling and feeling unheard. Maybe even 2020, harder to define but ok. But after he lost and tried like hell to have people steal the presidency for him. He wanted Pence to just declare him president, install fake electors, called up states to \"Find me the votes\" after all that, people think he deserves a second go around. That's what's keeping me up. \n\nAmerica would elect someone who would tear up the constitution for self gain because they think the price of eggs is too high. That little push we need to potentially elect the world's next monster is so small it's haunting.

I'm not joking, that is the end of it. There is no critical thought about *why* or *how* prices changed. There is no recognition of economic trends. There is no consideration of other policies - maaaaybe immigration depending on their media diet.\n\nEverything about sexism, racism, etc yes that can be true of his base and makes up contributing factors.

Nevermind that that cost of living has gone up everywhere (I'm currently living in Canada, CoL is *much* higher here than where I lived in the States - is that Biden's fault too?). What matters is that when Trump was president things were cheap and when Biden was president things were expensive, so if Trump is president again things will be cheap again. Nevermind that the events which *led* to this happened under Trump, because again the electorate literally cannot comprehend that anything can happen on a timescale beyond a couple days (slight /s).\n\nI'm not downplaying people's struggles - shit is expensive right now. It can be hard to get by. And part of me wants to be charitable because it is *hard* to try and understand politics when you are trying to feed your family while your bills go up faster than than your paycheck.

There's actually a good chance of that occurring if Dems don't totally lose motivation.\n\nA lot of the things Trump has said he would do, people either don't take him seriously about doing or don't consider the ramifications if he did.

Worthy criticism, but again, nothing to do with Biden or Kamala Harris.\n\nIt really is frustrating and frightening how people don\u2019t understand any of these basic economic concepts.

When you have a state government (usually GOP) hell bent on keeping abortion illegal, but its citizens want it to be legal, those in power will do whatever they can to make it hard for the people to get what they want (see Florida, Ohio), so no you\u2019re not always letting the states decide, you are letting the state governments decide.",

Providing many well paying jobs to the working class. Tarrifs will result in a wage increase for blue collar workers resulting in rents being easier to pay.\n\nsecond Republicans are big on deregulation, get rid of alot of the zoning and construction and permting laws. it's far easier to build in red states on average which is a big reason why they do better on housing \n \n\nand then of course the biggest help by far, mass deportations and closed borders. clearly reducing the population by almost 10% , deporting 20m people would massively lower rents especially on the lower end. It would free up millions of units. and furthermore it would skyrocket blue collar wages due to a mass labor shortage. So you'd have lower rents and higher wages.

         "Tariffs do not encourage domestic production, if it did then we wouldn\u2019t still be seeing the same trade deficit with China despite the tariffs placed on China by Trump and Biden. Beyond that, as an American company, if my Chinese or Indian counterparts are getting a $10 tariff placed on a $5 dollar product, why would I charge anything less than $14.99? Make it just barely cheaper than the most expensive competitor and people will buy it.\u00a0\n\nZoning is not a federal issue so that\u2019s a nothing argument. Also, they do better on housing because they use illegal underpaid labor, they are generally less desirable in terms of major cities and major industry, and they tend to be less desirable due to low education standards.\n\nMass deportation MIGHT help lower rents, but it won\u2019t be a one to one adjustment. Many illegal immagrants are living in over crowded apartments, motels, and dilapidated/abandoned housing that aren\u2019t fit for long term use. They\u2019re not living alone in 1000 sq foot 2 bedroom apartments for 800/month.\u00a0",

Better hope those wage increases happen overnight, the inflation and prices increases will.\n\n\n\nDeregulation will speed up housing construction. It will also increase construction deaths, and likely decrease the quality of the housing built. It may work, but it will also need years before the effects are felt.\n\n\n\nThe deportation will likely be felt the most. Nearly ~50% of ag labor is undocumented. Which means food prices may skyrocket, unless you happen to know a large population that's willing to fill that gap for the same meagre pay and lack of benefits. The same people who complained about workers wanting more pay for their labor are about to create that exact situation on a grand scale.",

After that you're going to have to raise the price of the thing you made to cover the cost of the tariff.\n\n>tarrifs force companies to build factories In the Us\n\nthey don't force anything but a higher price. If you tried to open a factory in the US you would still likely have to source your raw materials from other countries and pay the tariffs because the US doesn't have everything.\n\n>Republicans are big on deregulation, get rid of alot of the zoning and construction and permting laws\n\nThis is massive misunderstanding on your part or this is a big lie. Most zoning laws aren't even made at a state level. \n\nDo you know why most smaller and affordable homes are from the early-1970s or before? After the civil rights movement, the banks could no longer deny loans based on skin color. So conservative led municipalities all over America made exclusionary zoning laws that increased the minimum sqft of new construction so that  they would be out of reach for minorities with new and smaller loans. This was done in an effort to keep suburbs white. There is no denying this. This is a known facts. There are many books written on this topic and it was even upheld by the Supreme Court in the 1980s.\n\n>deporting 20m people would massively lower rents especially on the lower end\n\nHow exactly would you deport 20 million people without raising taxes significantly.

         "Agreed. As a foreigner I don't hesitate to name Bernie Sanders in the same breath as the likes of Franklin D. Roosevelt or Abraham Lincoln when it comes to impressive/great American leaders/politicians. Yes, he's not as influental as the other examples, but as you said, that's also due to the platform he's campaigning on (social democracy, in America viewed as socialism). Despite cancer like Fox News poisoning American democracy for decades now he still manages to steer the US in a more civilised direction.\n\nUnfortunately he's really old now (still perfectly sharp, but things often happen rapidly in your 80s). Fortunately though, his influence managed to make young prodigies like AOC more palatable to your people.",

         "It was refreshing seeing Kamala hit the swing states hard in the last week.  She also had a better ground game in the great lakes than Clinton did and Harris ramped it up in a short period of time.  Hubris was a big part of that downfall.  I hate relitigating all of this because that whole thing was so frustrating.  There's no world where a candidate like Trump should've had a chance in hell in '16.",
         "I'm a zillenial and I didn't vote for him (or anyone) but I really thought Bernie was gonna win before the DNC gave him an arrow to the knee. Brutal. He had undeniable mass appeal, but po boy didn't have wall street.",

         "They mean it was one of the reasons he won rather than being just another crazy candidate. The DNC\u2019s treatment of Bernie pissed off a lot of the left and alienated some to the point that they didn\u2019t vote or voted for Stein",

         "No, the media giving him billions of dollars in free advertisement compared to every other republican candidate in that primary, and the democratic primary in general. He got something like 80% of the coverage instead of him just being ignored like he should have been. One of the channels changed from Bernie giving a speech to switch to Trump's rally showing an empty fuckin podium.",

         "No way, they gave less coverage to the guy who's not even registered to the party???",
         "And Biden would have been too old to run and Harris would be too unknown/disliked to run. Shame things worked out the way they have. Bernie would have been great.\u00a0",

         "It would be nice to have some people in charge who didn't have kids nearing the retirement age.",
         "Exactly. It's the responsibility of people that are that old to step aside and help foster the younger generations to ensure posterity. This goes outside of just politics.",
         "I think Sanders is to the left of many socialists at least in my South American country. Doubling the minimum wage would be denounced as a communistic proposal here. So even though from an anti-capitalist standpoint he's not a socialist, I don't mind calling him one because I'm biased and the old man is lovely hahaha.",

         "Already happened in 2016 when the DNC screwed him over...",
         "I read a lot about what caused her to lose the election. Experts say it was due to a few things. Russian interference was a big one, 3rd party votes in battleground states, sexism/gendered ageism, and \"but her emails\" happened close to the election. Please read this if you are going to vote 3rd party. https://rollcall.com/2019/07/29/how-third-party-votes-sunk-clinton-what-they-mean-for-trump/.",
         "Unable to secure what would have been secured by pretty much any other person.\n\nA lot of polling showed that if Republicans nominated Trump in 2015/2016, he likely would have lost to anyone but Hillary Clinton. \n\nAnd her legacy, of that pretty much rigged nomination, is that we are still stuck with him.",
         "I remember that time and how she sort of couldn't. There was resentment toward the Clintons for NAFTA. Bernie, Obama, and others were campaigning there for her in her place because she was so toxic there. She was a terrible candidate to choose for that reason.",
         "No she just kept telling them everything is awesome!",

         "Exactly",
         "Tim tim",
         "You could argue it was that decision by the democrats that has caused all of America's problems until now, they underestimated Trump thinking Hillary could easily beat him even though Sanders was polling much better, and the rest is history. You stop Trump back then, you probably stop him for good, or at least stop his movement, he'd probably still be around but not a threat.",
         "I think that has a lot to do with our citizen legislature. People can\u2019t afford to serve because they need to work and you can\u2019t successfully do both. So the people who can financially survive and be in the legislature are either independently wealthy or retired. Sigh.",
         "How is that different from any other Democratic president? You don\u2019t think he would be able to compromise?",
         "It wasn't that he couldn't. He didn't try.",
         "And after losing to a small town mayor, he went on to win NH and NV. Every other candidate (other than Warren) and the entire party, prompted by the donors, had to then rally around Biden explicitly in an effort to stop Bernie. Not only did they lean on the scale in 2016, in 2020 the entire party mobilized to stop him getting the nomination. These are just facts.",
         "Bro what? Iowa isn't everything, after Bernie won New Hampshire and especially Nevada, many mainstream media outlets were saying he was the frontrunner with the most momentum. Pete and Klobuchar dropped out right before Super Tuesday to endorse Biden in what was obviously a coordinated effort.",
         "Just shows how much \"control\" the people rally have over your Democrat party.  Muh democracy is not yours, it's theirs",

         "The SNL bit about him being like Tim Walz was funny and obviously just a joke for the show, but Walz is actually memorable because he\u2019s actually part of the campaign. In 2016, I think only heard about Kaine when he was chosen as the running mate. During this cycle I hear about Walz almost if not as much as I hear about Harris. They are really doing a great job using him to fill in the holes in Kamala\u2019s supporter base.",
         "Who?",
         "Same. I honestly forgot she had a running mate until I opened this thread. \n\nIt does not bode well for your campaign if your running mate is that forgettable.",

         "You're not wrong. The Democrats lost because they made the same key mistakes in 2016; They put too much trust in the polls, and they, once again, thought centrism would be enough to turn out enough voters. Who woulda thunk, it fucking wasn't.",

Looking at the data on google they use historical data to pre determine the results of a state online. If only 40% precincts have reported for a state how do they know a states results with certainty?\n\nI can see this with a number of reporting precincts correlating with the number of remaining voters becoming a mathematical impossibility for the vote to swing back to another candidate.  But then when I checked Mississippi on the map on google it had 4% of precincts reporting but had already given the state to trump? \n\nI\u2019m just asking because I feel like this is part of why people think a states vote was defrauded. Like we\u2019re getting ahead of ourselves a bit before all the results are in.

But \"Latinx\" is a major unforced error by Democrats. As a native Spanish speaker who\u2019s been around Latinos my whole life, even the most progressive ones I know react to \"Latinx\" with a serious eye-roll. The typical response? \u201cWhite people really need to stop.\u201d While the term wasn\u2019t initially coined by white people, once they saw a few Latino voices championing it, it was quickly weaponized, irritating the majority of Latinos even more.\n\nIs this single issue costing Democrats the election?

Its creation essentially means that from now on it will be NATO itself, rather than its biggest contributor the United States, that will coordinate training Ukrainian troops and providing military equipment. \n\n> The Group of 7 \u2013 which unites the United States, Germany, France, the UK, Italy, Canada and Japan \u2013 finalised a $50 billion long-term loan to Ukraine that would be funded largely by the interest on frozen Russian assets in Europe.  \n\n> Outgoing US President Joe Biden has backed up his European allies by pre-empting the potential risk of a US withdrawal from the deal should Trump be re-elected by making sure the $20 billion US contribution will start becoming available by the end of the year. Congress has approved five bills on Ukraine assistance since the start of the war worth $175 billion, with $106 billion going directly to the government of Ukraine. At a news conference in Riga in mid-October, James O\u2019Brien, the assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian Affairs, said that Biden will be \u201cemptying out\u201d the funds the US Congress has earmarked for Ukraine before the end of his term. \n\n\n> Although it is not possible for a US president to unilaterally pull the country out of NATO \u2013 Congress last year passed a law that such a decision needs Senate approval \u2013 Trump\u2019s threat still remains very real as he calls the Alliance's golden rule on mutual defence into question.\n\nTL;DR NATO and the Biden Administration have been formulating a contingency plan that empties out current US funding for Ukraine, while transitioning responsibilities to European powers, who are funding it with frozen Russian assets.",

People don\u2019t seem to realize that Hitler really did nearly succeed in wiping out European Jewry.\n\nI do think the incorrect use of calling Trump Hitler contributed to people not taking Trump seriously as a threat.

         "Does that logic actually make sense in your head...?\n\nLike as you type that out are you thinking you're actually making a sound point, or are you just out of actual arguments and hoping that one slips through without being challenged?",
         "Well, I'll certainly give it a shot. The Crimean parliament voted to secede and join Russia after the 2014 US backed coup overthrew the democratically elected president of Ukraine. Then, the people of Crimea voted to join Russia too. Russia didn't \"seize\" Ukraine. If you think Crimea wants to go back to Ukraine you are just plain ignorant.\n\nSince the coup in 2014 there has been a civil war raging between the Donbass and western Ukraine because the Donbass wanted to break away as well, but was not in as good of a strategic position to do so as Crimea. Several attempts at a peaceful resolution were put in place since then called the Minsk Accords. These would have given the Donbass semi-autonomy, but remain part of Ukraine. Every time with both Minsk 1 and 2, Ukraine violated the agreement and continued to attack the Donbass.\n\nZelensky was elected on a platform of making peace with the Donbass. But, after taking office and right before the war started, he instead ordered all negotiations stopped and for the Donbass to completely surrender. He had also begun maneuvering troops towards the Donbass to begin an invasion of the Donbass. The day before, Kamala Harris also flew to Kyiv and gave a speech saying Ukraine would enter NATO, which is as our ambassador told us was the \"brightest of red lines for Russia\". At this point, the 2 Donbass republics declared independence and asked Russia for help. It's at this point that Russia then invaded in order to assist them.\n\nPutin didn't just wake up one morning, twirl his moustache, and order an invasion. This is a civil war that has been raging for the last decade (largely due to our CIA) and they need to work it out. We need to get out of there. There's already been a million dead Ukrainians at this point, is that not enough blood on our hands?",
         "That may be a concern, but it's not an American concern",

They either came in on legal immigrant visas or, in Puerto Rico's case, were always US citizens. Furthermore, the Hispanic peoples in the US are now deeply rooted and have been in the US multiple generations. Many who are US-born don't even speak Spanish. \n\nThey simply don't see themselves as connected to refugees and illegal immigrants, who now mostly come from Venezuela, Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala. Just because these countries are also majority Spanish-speaking doesn't make them the same. They are of different ethnicities. Remember that many refugees are Indigenous people who don't even always speak Spanish.\n\nSo some US citizen Hispanics react to them the same way white British people did to white Eastern European immigrants a decade ago - with revulsion, and a willingness to do whatever it takes to keep them out. They are US citizens and don't think deportation will happen to them - and tbf, it probably won't.\n\nThe fact that opposition to immigration nationwide is driven largely by white hostility to more Hispanic and Asian faces in the country doesn't matter. There are plenty of Hispanic men who are willing to identify as white for this reason - just as many immigrants in the UK and their descendants voted for Brexit. You don't have to be white to be racist. And you certainly don't have to be white to be sexist, transphobic, or authoritarian.",

It\u2019s a lack of experience with how things work mixed with an edgy sense of punishing those you disagree with. We won\u2019t hear a peep from them again once Trump starts fucking shit up.

Her policies were arguably worse than Biden's in 2020 to in my opinion on top of that. \n\nFracking, Gaza, Medicare for All.

Tariffs, tax cuts, destroying Fed independence so he can cut interest rates. All of that is inflationary. Think housing prices are high now? Wait until Trump starts rounding up most of the construction work force.\n\nRetained health insurance benefits. Think whatever you want to about Obamacare, it's significantly better than what we had before. Trump is going to repeal it so we all get to go back to the days when pre-existing conditions disqualify you from ever getting health insurance and every policy has annual and lifetime coverage limits. Hope you never get a chronic disease.",
         "It\u2019s no secret, and sugarcoating it is just dumb. I\u2019m speaking from personal experience, I doubt most other Hispanic men would disagree with that assessment.\n\nAnd I\u2019m not campaigning for anything, so I don\u2019t give a fuck about \u201cwinning back voters\u201d",

         "> Aligning herself with the Biden presidency that is center to center-right, \n\nI think this is the breakdown in discussion. Anyone who thinks the Biden admin is \"center-right\" is delusional. It's the most progressive administration in history.\n\nIf it feels differently that's a reflection on how far left online progressive culture has flown.\n\nFor context, Barack Obama ran on a platform banning gay marriage. He flipped in his second term when public sentiment shifted, but that's a really useful yard stick when you measure the distance to where Biden/Harris are on most issues.",
         "lmfao she trotted out liz cheney and touted how her immigration plan was republican. and supported a right wing fanatical government killing as many middle easterners as possible, refusing to shift from her predecessor. in what fucking way is this leftist?",

We can never have peace among ourselves and push to be better as a whole, it really doesn\u2019t make sense how a campaign built on hatred for fellow Americans won.

So either he was normalized or we have to accept that more than half the country is okay with racism, sexism, and fascism. \n\nTBF, it's probably a mix of both\n\nAlso, you've seen CNN right? They absolutely have hard shifted right and normalized Trump",
         ">I mean the votes are clearly showing she wasn\u2019t good enough\n\nWe're clearly drawing different conclusions from this but go off about how Harris didn't communicate her platform of 'not fascism' clearly enough",

         "The option was Dahmer's brain drill and a .45 from a US soldier in WW2. Who thought that the brain drill targeted on minors would be more popular than the handgun targeted on nazis?",
         "Im literally on the same side of the coin as you so what is your reasoning to why 10 million people who voted for Biden decided to not show up to the polls this go around? I\u2019m not asking this to attack you; I\u2019m genuinely curious",
         "Nope, the only reason people wouldn't vote for that vision of political and electoral perfection is misogyny. /s",
         "Honestly? Greed. Trump is the best thing for ratings and constantly giving a convicted rapist airtime and normalcy like he wasn't a self  proclaimed aspiring dictator made him a normal and okay consideration for the people who have been turned off to politics for decades. \n\nWe were slowly boiled alive staring well before Kamala, Biden, or even Obama."

How could that NOT have drastic consequences?  Yet, this was barely mentioned in Dem campaign ads, which consistently only made vague references to the ways Kamala would fix the problem. \n\nMeanwhile, the Republicans spent a veritable fortune on anti-trans ads and ads that fed on the problems caused by migrants.  Democrats had a very poor handle on the pulse of the nation; they blew it by not understanding that the vast majority of Americans are terrified of migrants and vehemently do not support the trans community.  People care about their pocketbooks; they don\u2019t give a crap that migrants come here to escape horrific conditions in their countries of origin or that trans people want hormone therapy and surgeries. This is laughable to most people and only likely to incite anger. The Republicans recognized this while the Dems apparently did not. They have four years to acknowledge these facts and plan accordingly \u2014 assuming there will even be a democratic voting process left in four years. People are likely to challenge this statement but by doing so, they only push the issues deeper under the carpet, from which they will re-emerge in ugly ways if not properly managed and addressed.  \n\nMeanwhile, Musk (seeking to escape prosecution for statutory rape) goes on TV and rants and raves about these issues and gets everyone fired up while somehow managing to make everybody forget about his true motivation and emerges as a brilliant tactician (not to mention $12 billion richer this morning). \n\nBrilliant posturing from the Republicans but it will cost this country dearly.

Under Project 2025, the newly named Department of Life would be required to take a \u201cbiblically based\u201d stance that families consist of a married mother and father, and the agency would make it easier for religious adoption and foster care services to refuse to work with LGBTQ+ couples. The plan also takes aim at various legal precedents and policies that have protected and expanded LGBTQ+ rights over the last decade. Project 2025 recommends reversing the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Bostock v. Clayton County, which protects LGBTQ+ people from workplace discrimination and has served as the foundation for cases involving gender identity. It further supports eliminating the promotion of gender-affirming care for minors nationwide.\nSeveral states have enacted policies that provide a glimpse of what Project 2025 would look like on the national level. In Texas, one city recently banned trans people from using public restrooms that don\u2019t match the sex assigned to them at birth, and the state\u2019s attorney general has sued two doctors who provide pediatric trans health care. Several other states have made it nearly impossible for trans people to update their gender marker on driver\u2019s licenses or birth certificates, and the future of gender-affirming care for all people rests upon an upcoming Supreme Court challenge of a Tennessee law. Legal experts have warned that Trump\u2019s victory, and a conservative-leaning Supreme Court, could mean few roadblocks to stop him from making Project 2025\u2019s vision of torching civil liberties of LGBTQ+ people into a reality.\u201d",

         "Gun control?  What was Harris' stance on gun control?  Do you know?  Because I do.\n\nShe said into a microphone that she herself is a gun owner that will shoot someone if they try to break into her house.\n\nShe actively did not run on gun control.",
         "Well you never mentioned gun control in your comment and we\u2019re on a post about a trans woman being elected to congress.. not sorry that I couldn\u2019t read your mind",

I was just saying that I think it's important to celebrate trans achievements, and yes, it may not matter to most people, but then they shouldn't care about this news, for them, it would just be another new person in Congress. If they're uncomfortable with the word \"transgender,\" they're unlikely to vote Democrat. How did I help Trump win? If it had anything to do with it, it was because of the transphobes who voted for Trump.",
         "Trans people have never existed anywhere near on the scale that we see today. That is a pretty easily verifiable fact.\n\nIt is a bizarre social contagion. You have to be a \u201cdumbass\u201d to not see it for what it is.\n\nYour comment regarding equating genuine medical use with voluntary use is just patently stupid. Even in some very liberal countries, the use of puberty blockers as treatment for trans teens has ceased. The data is just not there to conclusively prove that this should be the standard treatment method.\n\nI can assure you that there are many doctors who believe that this puberty blocker thing is absolute insanity. Case in point, my aunt is a retired pediatrician who specialized in reproductive development and growth disorders. She voted for Harris. But, this is one of the issues she vehemently disagrees with the Democrats on. But I guess she is just a dumbass, right?",
         "No, it did, there was polling on it.\n\nIf you are OK with that, I guess keep doing the same thing.\n\nIt is clear that the activists have done far more harm than good, upending a long-term trend of greater acceptance.  This is likely because of silly positions on female sports, school excesses, and the constant emotional-blackmail about children leading to a massive uptick in sterilization.\n\nMeanwhile, regular trans adults have to watch acceptance roll back because certain male athletes decided they were super special and got to compete against females.  We see how that is working out for regular trans people...",
         "I wasn't talking about Harris. If you read my comment I said Democrats in general, which unfortunately ends up poisoning the well and causing people to think all Democrats think that way.",

         "In this thread you have shown who the real dumbass is. May your social circle and family be filled with many trans people. Go walk the walk. Go befriend a few trans people today. I am sure you can find them quickly on social media. Marry one. Become one. Lol.",

         "Biden was never supposed to be a two term president, just a buffer until the Dems could find a suitable candidate. He was the candidate in 2020 because he had a good shot of winning again Trump since he was Obama\u2019s VP and he wasn\u2019t seen as a very extreme democrat so he could appeal to a lot of voters.\n\nBut instead of sticking with their plan the Democrats decided to let him run for reelection and come the summer his mind was far too gone to make it. So once he was convinced to drop it went to Harris since she was the only person that really made any sense, being Biden\u2019s VP. They took Obama\u2019s VP and he won so take Biden\u2019s VP and hope she can win.\n\nBut she is a terrible candidate, far worse than Biden was in 2020, far worse than Trump is, and somehow managed to perform worse than Hillary Clinton, who I thought was the worst Democratic candidate we\u2019ve had since Mondale.\n\nBut in pretty much every single state she has done worse than Hillary. Trump is expected to win every swing state on the map and, while he didn\u2019t win and wouldn\u2019t have, got frighteningly close to Virginia and New Hampshire, and now I think the margin of victory in New York is under 10% for Harris. Single digits in New York is insane. She hardly won Minnesota, which is where her running mate is from. That should\u2019ve been an easy win. I wonder how this election would\u2019ve played out if she had chosen Josh Shapiro, though after this I\u2019m imagining at best she gets PA and Trump gets MN.\n\nAnd not only did she do worse in easy to win blue states, but Trump ended her in red ones. In 2016 and 2020, he won Texas by 9 points and 5.6 points respectively. This time, he won it by well over 10 points (I wanna say close to 15). Florida was even more insane, he flipped it in 2016 and won by 1.3 points, and won in 2020 by 3.4 points, and this time he won by 13 whole points.\n\nHe also has a very good chance right now at winning the popular vote, and the Senate has gone to Republicans, the presidency has gone to republicans, and the house is close but it could very well go red majority. This was a landslide victory for Republicans and Trump, and she was destroyed.\n\nOutside of the results, the only thing I know now is that the careers of Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are virtually over.",

And would anyone upset about that messaging be happy with such insanely targeted policies like tax breaks for small business startups, or vague statements like saying we need an \"opportunity economy\"? This messaging was terrible and I can understand why people would feel unenthusiastic even if I personally still wanted her to win over Trump. It is the campaign's job to make people want to go out, and she squandered such massive enthusiasm from when Biden dropped out in some bizarre quest to find people who want to hear that the Cheneys of all people endorsed her.",

         "in the last election the early results heavily favored the republicans too.

For example here in Pennsylvania, most areas go for Republicans but in cities where there are millions of voters vs a few hundred thousand in rural and suburbs, tend to go Democrat.\n\nSo in CO of those not counted, most are likely from cities where Democrats generally win by a larger margin.\n\nIn most states this is a common trend: rural areas tend to vote red for Republicans and urban areas and cities tend to vote blue for Democrats.",

Whereas Joe Biden made safeguarding public lands and the transition to green energy a centerpiece of his time in office, Trump and his allies would reverse many of Biden\u2019s policies, remake the civil service and implement a new agenda focused on slashing regulations, weakening environmental protections, and expanding oil and gas development across the American west.\n\n5. https://suwa.org/trumps-assault-utah-monuments-leaves-millions-acres-limbo/  \n\n    >President Trump\u2019s repeal of Grand Staircase-Escalante and Bears Ears National Monuments on December 4, 2017 represents the single greatest attack a president has ever launched against America\u2019s federal public lands.

You folks recovered industries from COVID and have managed to handle inflation faster and better than almost every other major economy. Wages are high, unemployment is low, businesses are thriving, stock market is doing great etc.. The statistics don't lie, and to claim the US economy is \"bad\" is to misunderstand macroeconomics.\n\nBut, as you very well point out, there's a lot of working and middle class Americans who aren't seeing this wealth. Their rents, mortgages, grocery and gas prices have gone up, and they're finding it tougher to manage their finances day to day. I think this is something Democrats have to understand in their messaging: telling people that they're wrong about the economy when their wallets are bleeding come across as arrogant and disdainful.\n\nAnd the truth of the matter is, any Dem candidate would have to deal with this. Incumbents are getting crushed across the globe, largely due to unhappiness with inflation and rising costs. Had Trump been the incumbent, he'd have to deal with that blowback too (likely not as harshly though due to his extremely devoted base).",

As we have known all along, this is a razor thin race. Thanks to this amazing team, we have seen incredible turnout across the Battleground States, and the closeness of the race is exactly what we prepared for.\n\nWhile we continue to see data trickle in from the Sun Belt states, we have known all along that our clearest path to 270 electoral votes lies through the Blue Wall states. And we feel good about what we\u2019re seeing.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, we overperformed turnout expectations in Philadelphia, and overperformed in our early vote expectations in Bucks County. We don\u2019t have Election Day results from Philadelphia, but we do know that we overperformed turnout expectations there, and have seen specially high turnout in places with large non-white and student populations. We expect to see higher turnout in Philadelphia than in 2020. Outside of Philadelphia, we have limited data on turnout and support right now, but what we do have is tracking with our expectations. We are awaiting more results (like everyone else!), and hope to get a closer read in the coming hours.\n\nIn Michigan, we are awaiting a significant amount of votes to come in. The City of Detroit won\u2019t be reported out until roughly midnight, but we have seen strong turnout throughout early vote and Election Day there. Other results in Michigan are harder to parse, since results are coming in more piece-meal than elsewhere.\n\nIn Wisconsin, we know there is a significant amount of vote remaining in Dane and Milwaukee counties, and we are seeing signs of strong performance in the WOW counties, where we have partial data. We don\u2019t expect complete results from Wisconsin until tomorrow morning between 3 am - 5 am.\n\nPolls just closed in Nevada and Arizona so, as expected, it will be a while before we have more information from both states.\n\nWe\u2019ve been saying for weeks that this race might not be called tonight. Those of you who were around in 2020 know this well: It takes time for all the votes to be counted \u2013 and all the votes will be counted. That\u2019s how our system works. What we do know is this race is not going to come into focus until the early morning hours.\n\nWe\u2019ll continue to keep you all updated as we get more information. This is what we\u2019ve been built for, so let\u2019s finish up what we have in front of us tonight, get some sleep, and get ready to close out strong tomorrow.\n\nJOD",

         "Now we\u2019re at the part of the election where everything starts to move real slow. So let\u2019s break it down. \n\nThe most sensible path for Harris to win (which was agreed upon by virtually all pollsters) is Maine, New Mexico, Nebraska-2, Virginia, New Hampshire, Minnesota, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania.\n\nVirginia and New Mexico just called for Harris. \n\nMaine is absolutely crawling right now. We probably won\u2019t get their results tonight. \n\nMichigan is not looking great but still a long ways to go. Still several hundred thousand votes in Wayne County that need counting. By no means time to panic. \n\nPennsylvania is for Trump but he\u2019s running out of votes. The vast majority of votes left are from the Philly metro, that will be at a minimum another +200,000 vote margin for Harris. There are still large Harris chunks in Pittsburgh and in Cambria County. Trump\u2019s last gasp is York County- which has been a Republican stronghold for half a century. But Trump\u2019s margin here so far is a fraction of what it was in 2020. I don\u2019t know where the counted votes in York County have came from, but if this pattern continues, that would probably win Pennsylvania for Harris. But if the Philadelphia turnout was as high as advertised, she\u2019s got it.\n\nMinnesota will likely be called for Harris soon. She\u2019s up almost 150,000 votes and we\u2019re yet to count from Ramsey County yet. \n\nDespite being predicted to go to Republicans, NE-2 is looking good for Harris. She\u2019s up 20,000 votes with most votes counted. \n\nHarris has a healthy lead in New Hampshire. About 26,000 votes. It should be enough but we\u2019re still waiting on some Boston bedroom communities- namely Salem, Bedford, and Hudson. These usually lean Republican, but usually not by +10,000 vote margins, and Bedford flipped blue in 2020.\n\nWisconsin is a bit tricky because its precincts send results a bit at a time, so when it says that 76% of votes are counted, it means that approximately 76% of each county\u2019s votes are counted. Some early and late of course but it\u2019s a good bit more evenly spread than other states. Harris is down 100,000 votes. But there is one straggling county moving slower than the rest: Milwaukee. Conservatively, a +150,000 swing from Milwaukee\u2019s remaining votes should help. \n\nBut there\u2019s a problem. When Biden won Wisconsin, he pulled decent support in two Republican-leaning suburban counties: Racine and Kenosha. He didn\u2019t win them- he pulled roughly 47% in each, but that was enough to win the election. Harris is pulling 47% in Kenosha, but only 36% in Racine. If that trend doesn\u2019t improve, it may be the election. \n\nIf Wisconsin doesn\u2019t move for Harris, the she must win both Arizona and Nevada. Nevada probably won\u2019t be releasing counts for another few hours- most pollsters have it in a dead heat. Trump has about an 11,000 vote lead, but Harris is definitely in play. She\u2019s putting up better percentages than Biden so far in Maricopa, Pima, and Coconino County- but I will caution that these counties are gigantic and it\u2019s not easy to tell where these votes are coming from. \n\nSo, to conclude. It\u2019s not a disaster. It\u2019s not what anyone hoped for. But it\u2019s not a disaster. This was predicted to be a close race that would come down to the wire and that\u2019s exactly what happened. \n\nWe can talk about the vibes of this election and it\u2019s importance, but at the end of the day it\u2019s a game of turnout. And the turnout in several swing states- most particularly Georgia, were significantly lower than in 2020. That\u2019s the problem",

Trump's overall messaging is simple and speaks to the anti-establishment sentiments shared by the majority of the electorate. \n\nArguably Biden has done some great stuff on pocketbook issues for the working class but like I stated, they don't communicate their wins well, big or small. Why isn't Biden out there bragging on his administration doing really great antitrust work, by the likes of Lina Khan, Jonathan Kantor, and Rohit Chopra? Why didn't Kamala talk them up and how she needs to win for them to finish their work to end price gouging by monopolists? Or the FBI raids on exploitative landlords and lawsuits against Realpage to address the cost of living?\n\nThe Dem's solutions are too incremental, technical, and means-tested.  Their messaging is too nuanced, vapid, and/or couched in plausible deniability. Ever notice how \"telling it like it is\" or being a \"straight shooter\" is ALWAYS seen as a good quality in politicians? I assume because Dems see themselves as the Big Tent party they have to be inoffensive to everyone but by doing so, they appear vapid and alienate the working poor that struggle daily and are getting angrier and angrier at the system, our institutions, and apparently our social norms. Along the way, ironically in the fight for social justice, Democrats did end up alienating insecure white guys unintentionally and they do need to fix that. \n\nTrump or his advisers gets this and uses it to his advantage. \n\nI would love to have seen Kamala speaking to more everyday people's concerns.  Not telling them how bad Trump and Project 2025 will be, or how the stock market is doing great even though that only matters to the top 50%, arguably top 10%, or that inflation is down when people experience price increases viscerally everyday. Her polling was never higher than we she was talking a populist game and picked populist Tim Walz as a running mate. She should've differentiated herself from Biden better OR embraced his antitrust work as part of her price-gouging and cost-of-living focus.\n\nThis is the long term result of the Clinton realignment to cozy-up with corporations and mega-donors while leaving labor in the dust so I'm not solely blaming Harris. Shit even as a pro-union guy, I think the unions themselves have a lot of blame on their hands as well for poor messaging while they greased their palms.

You can read an article from Japan, the U.S., UK, Australia, South Korea, etc and they'll agree on reality (with some exceptions if it is Murdoch owned, but even many of Newscorps properties report actual news like the WSJ or Marketwatch).\n\n\nTL;DR They likely sampled all kinds of random people, but it isn't very entertaining when people just accurately recount something like a hurricane being weather instead of a Democrat weather control machine.",

But it totally reminded me of those charts that came out a couple years back about how republican voters basically have flip flopped on drone strikes depending on who was in office and democrats mostly stayed the same.\n\n\nA lot of \"enlightend centralist\" will claim that they think both sides are treating it as team sports, but honestly I only see one side talk about policy and actionable items and reaching across the aisle and another side spewing hateful horseshit team rhetoric",

Misinformation is so much worse than we\u2019ve even imagined.  This feels like a piece that will come out more and more going forward. And nothing substantial enough was done on it for a decade now. \n\n2. We let the billionaires buy up the media. And it was turned on us. It\u2019s not theory anymore to me. It\u2019s what they did as an institution. They didn\u2019t do it in such brash ways as misinformation bots, but they shot the blue cause in the foot often. \n\nThe \u201cclass war\u201d as we\u2019ve felt it feels over.

Now (while I don\u2019t believe it, I voted for her) she came out of the shadows to try and get the title of president. It\u2019s the perception it\u2019s given to many, including many in my family and circles in Florida and New Jersey. Man, when you have my Puerto Rican mother living most her life in northern NJ saying this and conflicted in voting for Kamala (rather leaving ballot absent ) you know there\u2019s a problem.

I liked her way more than Biden or Clinton. And everyone I spoke to seemed way more enthusiastic about her as well. \n\nYet somehow, the cruel person who called the other side varmen, is a convicted felon, twice impeached, regularly says intentionally hurtful things, is more popular...\n\nTruly an odd paradigm shift in American politics. \nAnd he shows no intention on fighting for any values I have... So IDK how I fit in his America. He doesn't make me feel like he will be a president for anyone other than his rich friends and those he's convinced are just people that will be rich someday too.",

She prosecuted black men for petty crimes such as Marijuana and kept them in prison for long sentences for the sake of private prison profits. She (and obama) alienated men, especially black men, by shaming them for not voting for a woman.

This is pure failure by the leadership and they need to be completely replaced if we want to stand a chance.\n\nIt's actually pathetic that democrats did WORSE when more minorities and working class people voted.

People on the left say this openly and speak about it like it is this great and empowering thing because it gives women more freedom.\n\nBut if you talk to young men about the topic and what it actually means for their lives, they are being told (1) that the only reason women ever valued men like them was for their resources, (2) that they will never have a partner, and (3) that it is their own fault for failing to meet a completely arbitrary set of standards and they are terrible people because of that failure.",

Honestly, I think it would have done a lot if the topic was simply treated with some nuance rather than as an unmitigated good. When men spoke about their problems, people on the left could have talked like this:\n\n* Society has changed in a way where less men will have a partner and we admit that this is a problem that will make their lives worse even though some of them do not deserve it, but these are all the reasons it is worth it and these are the ways we can help you...\n\nInstead, what they tended to say stuff that clearly meant this:\n\n* Men do not have any real problems and any man who claims there is a problem is having that problem because they are a terrible person...\n\nIf you cannot even admit that someones problems are real or speak to them like you do not hate them, you are ceding the conversation to the people that can, even if your solutions are better and more moral than theirs.",

If something as big as the presidential election can be swayed by what is essentially a psychology trick, what chance do we have to ever know what truth really is?\n\nAlso how do you reconcile this, are voters ignorant or did they just really love trump? Would their votes have been swayed if they had more information? How do we live ourselves if the answer to that is \u201cno\u201d? If the answer is yes, how do we get that information to people considering all the studies that show facts don\u2019t change peoples minds? It honestly feels like we are in a way with misinformation",

Unfortunately \u201cthe masses\u201d in large part are not well-informed.\n\nThat said, I don\u2019t think people are voting based on liking Trump.

Thank them.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t share things before checking your sources,\u201d he added.\n\nAnd finally, \u201cLet the process run its course. It takes time to count every ballot.\u201d\n\nMore than 82 million voters cast early ballots this year, which is slightly more than half the total turnout in the presidential election in 2020, according to The Associated Press.\n\nStates have different rules dictating when and how ballots must be counted. Some states have changed their rules since 2020, which could change the timing of when results come in.\n\nIn 2020, the race was not officially called for days after the election, leading experts to preemptively warn the public against expecting to know the results of the race on Tuesday night. Experts also warn that early poll returns do not necessarily indicate the trajectory of the entire election.\n\nVice President Harris and former President Trump are entering Election Day in what polls indicate could be the closest race in recent history.\n\nAccording to The Hill/Decision Desk HQ polling aggregate, Trump and Harris are tied nationally, with 48.4 percent support each.",

Harris is behind right now...and then NY will finish counting and suddenly she'll leap ahead, a few smaller states will finish and Trump will go back etc. etc. Happens all the time since like...FDR?\n\n2: Florida was never really in play and this is specifically by design by the GOP; not only do they have a true believer in DeSantis but he has actively been trying to make the state a worse place in order to drive out anyone more liberal/progressive than a Confederate General. If it wasn't for all the tourist trap places setting up shop way back when, FL would probably be one of the poorest, most abandoned states in the US and they know it.\n\n3: Everyone thought Biden was losing too; until he suddenly wasn't. Calm down.\n\n**EDIT:** Point 4: This was always very likely to be a close election with a good chance of Trump legitimately winning, even if myself and others think he won't. When it's a razor's edge like this, little things going wrong (or right) can tip the balance, so best laid plans and all.

One more fact, it takes a lot longer for one county to count 1.5 million votes in that county than it does for 100 rural backwaters to count 10,000 votes in each county.  The small, rural areas, always report quick.  The Democrats vote comes in big chunks much later.  \n\nIt\u2019s gonna be a long night.  This is very close.",

Vs hundreds of thousands in other states without a call.\n\nBy 10pm or midnight tonight unless it's very close there should be one state that helps tip the scales and we all should know a lot more.",

He mocked Biden for being old and mentally infirm, and he repeatedly mispronounced Harris\u2019s name and insulted her intelligence. At times, he echoed rhetoric from Nazi Germany and, more recently, falsely declared himself \u201cthe father of IVF\u201d and promised to protect women, \u201cwhether the women like it or not.\u201d\n\n> A week ago Sunday, at what was supposed to be his triumphant Madison Square Garden rally in a city that had never fully accepted him, Trump\u2019s speech was overshadowed by a comedian who appeared before him and described Puerto Rico as \u201ca floating island of garbage.\u201d Trump was livid, saying the comment \u2014 and ensuing days of negative headlines \u2014 was an unforced error in the final days, two people close to him said.\n\n> Yet for much of the campaign, Trump offered a message of xenophobia and misogyny and racism, of cruelty and darkness and hate. If he wins, it will be because enough of the nation embraced that message, too. And if he loses, it will be because enough of the nation voted against that message \u2014 and Trump himself.\n\nexcerpted from (possibly  paywalled) article: \n\n[In the final stretch before Election Day, Trump \u2014 to the chagrin of many aides and allies \u2014 has seemed unable to curb his worst impulses.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/11/05/trump-final-days-2024-campaign/?utm_campaign=wp_the7&utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&carta-url=https%3A%2F%2Fs2.washingtonpost.com%2Fcar-ln-tr%2F3f88b4c%2F672a079009757d7432beb443%2F60d1f4309bbc0f32a3467c8e%2F29%2F107%2F672a079009757d7432beb443)",

He's insulted and threatened people, public and private. He's disgraced himself, which has become all too normal and accepted for his campaigns. \n\nWorst in history. Yes. Somehow trumping his own ugly, deranged performances in the past. \n\nBut you're giving her a little too much credit. Kamala has applied herself competently. She's avoided gaffes. She's pulled together policy agendas in relatively short time in reaction to being handed the baton mid-season. All that is commendable.\n\nHowever, that's not the best campaign in history. You're getting carried away. \n\nObama was quite a bit more effective at winning hearts and minds. He didn't have the benefit of his opponent being the most repugnant human being on earth. He hadn't been VP for 4 years. He was the underdog and rose meteorically because of his rhetorical skill, his agreeable, common sense and sensible persona, and a massively innovative campaign leveraging the internet (during the onset of Web 2.0 days) in unprecedented ways, basically writing a new playbook for every political campaign of the following 18 years. His team combined data science and grassroots mobilization and globally recognizable branding to get our first African American president elected. He was a fucking rock star.\n\nKamala hasn't come anywhere close to that. She's borrowed some of those moves, which have been refined over almost 2 decades, and she's wisely followed his lead in approaching controversial issues with caution and consideration. But she has barely broken through all the noise Trump creates. She's going to be a great President (assuming the country doesn't fuck this up) but she's largely being propelled by people's hatred of Trump because even though she has made the effort to explain what she stands for, most people don't feel like they've heard her.

As a married individual, I get about 15% more than I would if were single. There is good reason for this that includes the fact that my spouse must care for me at times. When Trump inevitably repeals same-sex marriage, this will directly harm me and my family. A big agenda under Project 2025 is to gut VA disability benefits. This means that the extra 15% will disappear because the federal government will no longer recognize my marriage. Not only that, but they very specifically want to cut/limit VA disability benefits for PTSD.

         "I keep hearing the same things over and over here on politics. It\u2019s this big deluded not remembering or paying attention to anything happening except the echo chambers that people live in.\n1. Trump did not cause Covid. Every economy in every country crashed because of Covid. Before Covid our country had a much much better economy. Whether that was because of Trump or someone else that can be debated. The fact of the matter is we paid less for everything while he was in office. That is what the voting public remembers. That is almost entirely the reason he made it into office.\n2. Enough with identity politics. Who cares what race, what sexual preference, what pronoun and all the other nonsense. We need to do things that help our country. Not what helps less than one percent of the population. I\u2019m with Spock. The needs of the many. If everyone would just live by the mantra don\u2019t be an asshole and look for the things that bring us together instead of the things that keep us apart we would be much better.\n3. Stop saying the world will come to an end because of who is in the White House. It won\u2019t. Trump was already in the White House once and the world didn\u2019t abruptly end. Watch the reaction and comments from other world leaders. With the exception of the extreme left leaders they are extremely positive. \n4. There is a crisis at the border. I live in a border state. We see it with much more laser focus than people that don\u2019t live near the border. Immigration is good. We should have opportunities for people from other countries to come here. We don\u2019t have to make it easy to obtain citizenship. We need to make it easy to obtain a visa. This is in line with the rest of the world. Just like every other country in the world you give out a visa that requires check ins. As long as a person isn\u2019t breaking the law, they get to stay. Break the law, GTFO. \n5. Women\u2019s reproductive rights should be taken out of old men\u2019s hands. On this I agree. This is my message to both parties on being a woman. The right needs to stay the hell out of my uterus. The left needs to stop being jealous they don\u2019t have one. If my daughter is raped, has a problem pregnancy, or is 17 and doesn\u2019t have the resources to take care of a child she should have options. Full stop. She also should not have to compete in sports with someone that physically she will never have a chance at beating. Also full stop. We as women are under full force attack. It needs to stop. Bite me to both sides on this issue. \n6. Healthcare I have no idea what will happen here. Something needs to change drastically here. Neither party is willing to do the necessary here. Healthcare needs to be taken out of the hands of large corporations. The policies we have on healthcare has put the US extremely low on the lists for quality healthcare. The best I have seen us perform is 32nd the worst is 57th. It\u2019s a sad day when somewhere like Venezuela has better healthcare than we do. I now travel out of the county for things when I can. I no longer trust our system. The current system should be burned to the ground so we can start over. I could rant forever on this. Makes me angry. \n7. LGBTQ The world is not going to end for you. The vast majority of people regardless of party affiliation are of the opinion that the government should stay out of people\u2019s bedrooms. Love who you want marry who you want and be happy. I do not see any risk of this changing. I would fight for you if anyone tried to take away the rights that have been accomplished here. Most people would. \n\nWhat I want to leave here with is this. We have amazing people in this country. We should concentrate on working together. Not looking for ways to burn the other side down.",
         "Been through a lot of comments on this reddit and something which is not being called out are the echo chambers on reddit and other social media platform. Harris was really propped up so much that everyone genuinely thought she will win hands down...and maybe the turnout was not that great because of that? Everyone believed she is winning so a lot of folks didn't even bother to go and vote. Secondly, Trump managed to do appeal to day to day life struggles of everyone with his \"Look at the inflation\" strategy. This might get me downvoted, but people struggling to keep a roof over their heads and food on their table don't give a fk about pronouns and identity politics, which somehow had become the central topics for the Harris camp. Also, the lax illegal immigrants policy resulted in fear mongering where regular people where concerned about sharing their resources with illegals in an already f*ked up economy.

         "I think he means that he is fine if the government tells Burgers King, MCDonalds and more to lower the prices of food if they use the absolute worst ingredients and cut away all form of health regulations to make that happen. And that said companies cannot get sued if Psyk\u2019s get sick or die",
         "I didn't vote for less government. I want government to regulate company greed, but there are zero parties that want to do that (otherwise Biden and Harris would have actually done something about rising costs instead of just saying 'We have the best economy in the world, what do you mean you can't afford a house???)",

         "Nope I mean that trying to tell someone 'we have the best economy in the world' when everything is more expensive than it used to be is a losing strategy.\u00a0",
         "Voting Republican is voting for less government. People would lose their fucking *minds* if the democrats suddenly started forcing corporations to lower prices lol.\u00a0\n\nAlso, about not affording houses, have you tried getting a better job?",
         "I didn't vote for any Republicans.\u00a0\n\n\nBut you kind of sound like on with the 'Get a better job.'",
         "Yes, because that\u2019s what republicans told me to do. Just spreading the Republican love that people upset with the Democratic Party now get.\u00a0"

         "I really thought we'd had enough of all of this as a nation.  I didn't expect a landslide.  I didn't expect Trump's base to move over.  However, I did think after we'd seen an attempted coup, that women started losing right, after Trump flat-out declared that he was going to go after his enemies, after EVERYTHING that we've seen over the last eight years, that the majority of us represented in the electoral college would say that we've had enough of this.\n\nI just don't even know what to say now.  I don't even recognize the country anymore.  I feel like everything after 9/11 happened has just been upping the crazy every year besides the relative calm of the Obama presidency.  \n\nHopefully I'm wrong about how far this new government will take things, but I don't think people realize how close we are to an authoritarian government that we will never be able to step away from without a civil war.  I felt like things were fraying constantly during the first Trump administration, and there will be far fewer guardrails in this one.  I'm very worried that we're going to look like Turkey or Russia in the near future.",

         "This is worse than 2016. This is the beginning of the end of everything we have built up after WW2. Guess it tracks. Humanity is doomed to repeat the same shit over and over again.",
         "This is worse. Americans knowingly voting for project 25 is wild.",
         "This is pretty clearly worse than 2016. \n\nTrump is projected to win the popular vote. Republicans are on track to win 5-6 seats in the Senate and win the House. \n\nFormerly Dem strongholds like New Jersey are polling closer than battleground states.\n\nTexas slid back to solid red.",

It's not the result of being too right wing. It's the result of the other side descending into absolute madness. And you know, they will get what they wish for. If Republicans win everything, let's see them magically fix it all. Let's also see the shocked Pikachu face when bad shit actually happens like we said it would. Oh well, at least there's no question who is at fault.",

Then during Covid, Trump printed a shit ton of money (trillions) and then Biden won and printed another trillion or two. This massive injection of cash lead to the rampant inflation of 2020 - 2023. Biden\u2019s policies and Fed chairman Jpow deserve a lot of credit for bringing inflation down to a normal level in the last 6 months. Now the electorate doesn\u2019t realize Trump also is responsible for the inflation we\u2019ve lived with for a couple years, they don\u2019t realize his shitty handling of Covid and printing of money lead to a difficult cost of living situation and Biden gets all the blame. Then people think Trump was better; and now he inherits Biden\u2019s economy which is actually much stronger and healthier than your average layperson realizes.",
         "To the MAGA dads with daughters out there, fucking way to vote against their best interests. At this point I'm all but certain there is no God and there is no hope, but I hope to high hell that whatever modicum of karma there is out there will come back to haunt you down the road you selfish, spineless nutsacks.",

         "Biden and the Democratic party lost this election. Biden should have announced he wasn't seeking a 2nd term by the start of 2023. Democrats should have listened to the middle class more in this country. Instead, we get 4 more years of more racism and stripping of rights and protections.",
         "I truly underestimated just how stupid the average American is",
         "Everybody discussing Harris is only natural. However, Harris did alright with the situation she stepped into and Biden likely would have done worse. \n\nThe problem here is that the Democratic Party continues to fail to deliver for people in a convincing way. Outside of Obama they\u2019ve sucked for 24 years in popularity, the brand is falling apart.",
         "And the Dems probably still won't learn the correct lessons.\u00a0",
         "Oh no, this is worse. Much worse. Back then, Trump inherited a country fresh off an Obama administration\u2019s 8 years of work. Now Trump is inheriting a war in Ukraine and the Middle East. He will also be building on the division he started in our country with project 2025. We will be lucky if our grandchildren get to see America recover from this.",
         "After everything, he is going to win the EC and popular vote. We are not a serious country",

         "Did all that tap dancing for GOP voters. Embraced Dick Cheney and adopted right wing border policy, just not to get picked. Being spineless and making every group expendable isn't winning people over..",
         "Democrats repeated the same strat as 2016 and expected different results. The election isn't decided yet. \n\nBut had Harris appealed to the actual left and the some 80 million eligible voters who sit out of presidential elections because they see no major distinction between the parties... maybe this would have gone differently.\n\nhillary strat of courting repubs, gets hillary results.",
         "At least I won't hear about pseudoscience idiots like the \"keys to the white house\" guy again.",
         "They fucked up by not going with a generic white candidate. It was a masterclass in how to run an awful campaign. \n\nDemocratic leadership hung onto Biden for way too long. His selfish pride fucked us until they were forced into making a quick change. That quick change was a female POC, which this country was never going to elect. \n\nIf they just rolled out a generic safe white guy in 2023 this would have probably been a different story. They didn't, they fucked up and I'm disappointed in them. \n\nI'm not surprised by any means though. It was obvious this would be the road we were heading down when they held onto Biden..",
         "Yea but in 2028 we have a secret weapon.\n\nWe're going to nominate......get this...... a Hispanic woman!  or...maybe an Asian woman!!! surely, this time we will win!\n\nJesus Christ the Democratic party will never fucking learn.  Pick a good candidate, and pick an easily electable VP, not a Black woman in an insanely misogynistic and racist-ass country.\n\nI would like to win another election in my lifetime, thanks.",

You deserve to lose your Obamacare you deserve to lose access to abortions. If you're in that age group and you didn't fucking vote. FUCK YOU!",
         "Most predictable outcome ever. Thats what harris gets for targeting Trumps base in the suburbs. She was never galvanizing that base like Biden did. She needed to go left. She went center.",

         "So far I\u2019m doing mentally better this time than in 2016. I\u2019ve accepted that America is mostly just a right-wing country, even when the Dems are in power, and that isn\u2019t going to dramatically change anytime soon.",
         "Running on joy was the dumbest idea. They should have used fear like the republicans do. It\u2019s a stronger motivator and united them against the Dems messaging.",

         "It's way worse because we know how horrible Trump was the first time, and now he's out for revenge.",

         "Maybe more identity politics next time.   And release a new Star wars trilogy but make it all lame.",
         "I\u2019m just as pissed off at the Dems at this point. I feel betrayed, all this joy and bluster for Harris was just manufactured garbage. My gut feeling that she was a horrible choice and that America isn\u2019t ready for a woman president was spot on. They could have run Walz, Shapiro, Newsom, like any fucking white dude would have won. She lost 20 million votes compared to Biden, and that\u2019s with Trump losing 10 million himself. So 30 fucking million Americans said fuck the noise I\u2019m not voting this go around.",
         "The biggest mistake she made was making the faults of Trump her whole campaign. It just makes the entire election about him, when you want to stand on your own. Americans want to hear solutions to problems beyond Trump.\n\nAlso didn't exactly help to try coasting on celebrity endorsements. The average American could care less.",
         "This is what happens when you don\u2019t have robust primaries! The Kamala Harris campaign was essentially a big nothing burger. No meat and potato policies. The only popular thing they did was pick Tim Walz and then buried him away. If the democrats are going to continue to choose what\u2019s best for donors over what\u2019s best for people then they deserve to lose.",

         "Yeah def worse. See in 2016, dnc pushed  for a win with a white women, who had nothing to do with the administration at the time. 2024, he decided to pick a women of color, directly from the current administration, who couldn\u2019t distance herself from it or criticize it, and they picked her last min.\n\nThis was a hard slap in the face.",

         "For all the people who say this one out, we lost our democracy because of you.",
         "Blame the Dems.\n\n\nDifferent flavor of the same shit they did with Hillary. They bucked the priamary\u00a0 they put up a man who was arguably more decrepit than DT.",
         "Unfortunately this is politics and it's horrible. But it is what it is and the Dems should know this.\n\nFirst, choosing biden for a second term. Huge disaster.\n\nSecond, thinking that Harris could win in the current America? Second huge disaster.\n\nHow didn't they learn from the Hillary Clinton disaster?\n\nI said two years ago that what the Dems need is an average Joe male candidate around 40-50 years old. Good debater and with the facts at his fingertips.\nThat man wins this election.\n\nSadly...the sexism and racism in the US are still too much for some. But again... The Dems should know this.",
         "Here's how hil-harris can still win!",
         "I believe what the news always tells me.  I believe what people tell me on social media.  Why didn't Harris sweep the swing states?  Why hasn't the most unpopular VP in history not winning any swing states?  Why she hasn't flipped Texas and Florida and Iowa?  Has my whole life been a lie?  This isn't what was promised to me!!!!",

         "A candidate forced upon us by a corrupt DNC afraid to actually let the people decide the candidate they want, again. Same result but worse impact. The hubris of the DNC leadership has doomed us to authoritarianism.",
         "4 years ago I saw the Biden win as not really a victory but a steady hand to hold the ship while the country pivots. \n\nNow, it might just be a short blue blip in a run of conservatives in office. Trump 2024 is one thing but Vance 2028 is just....",

         "It is.  Trump is a known quantity as President and he\u2019s unhinged.  Voters ignored all those from his first administration who said don\u2019t trust him.  And he\u2019s a felon and has no regard for the law or Constitution.",
         "Yeah, at least Hilary won the popular vote",

         "Nightmare",
         "Yah 2016 while def a failure on Dems part also felt like a crap system. Ie the whole losing the pop vote etc. \n\nThis is a much more resounding win for Trump. I hate it, it\u2019s gonna fuck things up, but it\u2019s very clearly what the voters wanted and well sometimes that means seeing what the consequences are.",

         "I agree with you that it\u2019s worse, but I\u2019m also less shocked this time. \n\nThere are a lot of very stupid people in America who don\u2019t understand the basics of how our economy works, and they can be easily manipulated to vote against their own best interests by appealing to their baser instincts.",
         "Yep. He was an unknown quantity in 2016. In 2024 we're all forced to accept that a society will willfully choose to give a bad person nearly limitless power for the empty promise of lower prices and solutions to made up problems.\n\n\"but he made the trains run on time\".",

At the same time, I think there is a degree to which the conversations have become exclusionary to young men, and that might even be valid in the abstract, but which has left them no place.

Unfortunately, the toxic version of these things are also easier, it's so much easier to be entitled and then to simply be angry when you don't get what you want, so I don't know what the answer really looks like here, but I think this is a key aspect of the right wing propaganda machine you're describing.\n\nTo be sure, there are others (it's not all just young people nor men who get sucked in after all) but this seems like such a strong funnel.\n\nI have a son as well as a daughter, and I ponder and worry about this because I want to protect them both from these phenomena.",

To the extent it turns out to be true that Latino people voted against their own interests we should forgive them and show concern for their well-being.  \n\nIf the worst case comes to pass and Latino communities are getting ripped apart and people are being crowded into camps and sent to countries they haven't been in or over a decade they will already be punished. \n\nWe need to recommit to our principles and use this as an opportunity to demonstrate the importance of those principles. \n\nWhen people are suffering and atrocities are being committed we will be there working to fight and resist it and we will earn the commitment that has been lost.",

They glossed over it and said facts but that wasn\u2019t enough they needed to lean in more. I think this also has to do with how short of a campaign Harris had which played against her. She was starting at a huge deficit and caught up as much as she could but couldn\u2019t get passed the right wing noise."

Water under the bridge now anyway, but almost every other social media is swarmed with Trump support and these subs and Reddit as a whole is so insanely Trump deluded that y'all have directly contributed to him winning. Trump was factually much more active on social and doing interviews without having CBS/NBC/etc edit his answers and cut out the gaffs. This sub is a microcosm of what they did in that every conservative post, against the rules or not, gets deleted. People openly talk about the echo chamber not working. Also her approval rating is all time bad and that is also factual. Cope!",

Go look at the multitudes of videos showing the footage Fox used and the full video. How they'd cut away and exclude the 'bad'.  The excuses for 'he didn't mean it' or 'he was joking'? Hell, that was said multiple times a DAY on almost every commentary on the network for months. Again - provable with a simple search. The accusations that inflation, illegals, etc., were all the Dems fault? Again, video proof is widely available to show that. Despite the fact a lot of it is equally (if not more) to blame on the Republican party in many instances (more provable fact - such as which party voted down the most recent border bill). And as for where the majority are getting their news? A single search shows the 'most watched' news network in the US is... drumroll... Fox News. So again, all of those are provable facts. \n\nAs for the final aspect, whether history repeats itself, well, do I believe that? History has shown its true.

He procrastinated wildly when asked to make difficult decisions, and would often end up relying on gut feeling, leaving even close allies in the dark about his plans. His \"unreliability had those who worked with him pulling out their hair,\" as his confidant Ernst Hanfstaengl later wrote in his memoir Zwischen Wei\u00dfem und Braunem Haus. This meant that rather than carrying out the duties of state, they spent most of their time in-fighting and back-stabbing each other in an attempt to either win his approval or avoid his attention altogether, depending on what mood he was in that day.\n\n>There's a bit of an argument among historians about whether this was a deliberate ploy on Hitler's part to get his own way, or whether he was just really, really bad at being in charge of stuff. Dietrich himself came down on the side of it being a cunning tactic to sow division and chaos\u2014and it's undeniable that he was very effective at that. But when you look at Hitler's personal habits, it's hard to shake the feeling that it was just a natural result of putting a workshy narcissist in charge of a country.\n\n>**Hitler was incredibly lazy. According to his aide Fritz Wiedemann, even when he was in Berlin he wouldn't get out of bed until after 11 a.m., and wouldn't do much before lunch other than read what the newspapers had to say about him, the press cuttings being dutifully delivered to him by Dietrich.**\n\n>He was obsessed with the media and celebrity, and often seems to have viewed himself through that lens. He once described himself as \"the greatest actor in Europe,\" and wrote to a friend, \"I believe my life is the greatest novel in world history.\" In many of his personal habits he came across as strange or even childish\u2014he would have regular naps during the day, he would bite his fingernails at the dinner table, and he had a remarkably sweet tooth that led him to eat \"prodigious amounts of cake\" and \"put so many lumps of sugar in his cup that there was hardly any room for the tea.\"\n\n>He was deeply insecure about his own lack of knowledge, preferring to either ignore information that contradicted his preconceptions, or to lash out at the expertise of others. He hated being laughed at, but enjoyed it when other people were the butt of the joke (he would perform mocking impressions of people he disliked). But he also craved the approval of those he disdained, and his mood would quickly improve if a newspaper wrote something complimentary about him.\n\n>Little of this was especially secret or unknown at the time. It's why so many people failed to take Hitler seriously until it was too late, dismissing him as merely a \"half-mad rascal\" or a \"man with a beery vocal organ.\" In a sense, they weren't wrong. In another, much more important sense, they were as wrong as it's possible to get.\n\n>Hitler's personal failings didn't stop him having an uncanny instinct for political rhetoric that would gain mass appeal, and it turns out you don't actually need to have a particularly competent or functional government to do terrible things.",

         "It gives hope to *shitty* Americans.",
         "Yeah just tell all those imprisoned people all they need to do is become president.",
         "Oh.....oh you're being serious",
         "Libs and most of the other conservative factions love the prison industrial system.",
         "This is an even dumber take.\n\nMOST people are not victims of robbery, assault, or have their homes broken into.",
         "Defrauding an election affects me personally more than someone I don't know in a state I'll never set foot in getting their car broken into.",
         "He\u2019ll likely appoint Cannon to the AG.",
         "Appointing another counsel to prosecute the case? Wasn't there issues with Flynn's plea being erased? Like the judge had to accept it.",
         "We\u2019re already damned if you do, damned if you don\u2019t. So yeah, why not play their game and see where it takes us. Already got nothing left to lose.",
         "They had four years to prosecute these fascist traitors and imprison them to save our democracy before they had another chance to strike. Instead they delayed and dragged their feet the entire time worrying about the optics. Dem leadership of the past four years will be remembered like the liberals in Weimar who appeased Hitler (before he killed them all).",
         "I mean should people not have? A bunch of people who are easily manipulated tried to overthrow the government, and while they were never close, people (including them) got hurt.",
         "FDR and Trump*",
         "He was just proved innocent by the biggest jury of all time.",
         "We the people don\u2019t acknowledge the verdict of kangaroo courts.",
         "I wouldn\u2019t because I\u2019m not important enough to be the victim of government weaponization from the nazi left.",
         "There is another Joe who should probably be in prison",
         "The lesson here should be, don\u2019t alienate your voter base by talking down to them for four straight years.",
         "Anyone can have a dream, for one felon, their dreams came true. America has spoken.",
         "Is this not what you believe? Can a person not learn from past mistakes? So somebody who commits a felony has to be judged forever? Don\u2019t most liberals believe that a person should not be judged based on labels",
         "Most people don\u2019t win the lottery, but they still buy tickets.\n\nPeople *fear* this stuff and they want something done about it, telling them it\u2019s not happening just makes them angry.",
         "This is non sensical. Crime is a real thing in todays cities, nit only that but an apathy to enforce and convict. Thats what people voted for. Stop being naive",
         "damn you guys really cant understand irony",
         "Trump won 2, lost one. Unless you believe in the \"big steal\", in which case reality isn't that important to you.",
         "In no way does his election as POTUS do that. What?",
         "Quo warranto? Your opinion is not that of the State. Article 3 processes are valid, and independent. If a District judge did that, it would basically immediately be referred to the full SCOTUS. Their ruling, is binding on all citizens; \"We\" would agree on that, no?",
         "This wasn't an argument of importance. \nI rather be myself than be as disgusting person as trump.",
         "Hey if people want to say it's about \"Law and Order\" and \"Family Values\" when it comes to voting Republican, they've essentially put the clown makeup on themselves and started honking their horns.",
         "Because it's fine to break laws if people talk down to you. Got it.",
         "The American dream is about rising from poverty. The issue of over incarceration is that it affects the poor at higher rates. A rich guy getting off free is not a manifestation of that sentiment.",
         "Lol i highly doubt this is a good faith argument but ill answer like it is in case someone else reads this.\n\nYes a person can learn and reform but that should be accompanied with appropriate consequences.  For example a president who betrays their oath of office and leads an insurrection should not be president again.\n\nSomeone who shop lifts at 17 should be able to get a job yes you dopshit",
         "Felons can and often do learn from past mistakes. However this usually occurs after they've served their sentence, paid their debt to society, and proved they've changed for the better. They also generally have to prove they won't repeat whatever crime they committed. \n\nTrump hasn't done any of this.",
         "NOBODY is saying it is not happening. Fear mongering apparently is the winning formula. Creating scenarios that are not likely happening (using your lottery comparison) I guess is the way to campaign in the future. Misinformation it into existence.",
         "I\u2019m not calling for an uprising if that\u2019s the \u201cirony\u201d you\u2019re referring to. I assumed by your use of the word \u201csquawking\u201d that you found the criticism of j6 unfounded in the first place. Sorry if I got that wrong but a lot of Americans (and even more pathetically, Canadians) are somehow dumping for this guy.",
         "It actually does. No logical person wants a felon in office unless the felonies are bogus.",
         "Keep taking that copium buddy",
         "We like to put people in jail who commit crimes. I live in a blue state where the crime is awful, but nobody ever gets charged. \n\nFamily values? We saved families, most women voted for Kamala on the abortion stance alone. The right to kill babies. We don\u2019t like late term abortions",
         "Yea, pretty much. Dems like to burn cities to the ground when people are mean to them so yea",
         "A rich man who appeals to the poor. A man who was shot for our freedom, we will happily welcome him into the Oval Office",
         "I think you are overestimating the amount of people who actually would call it an insurrection. Most people call the George Floyd protests riots instead. The voting shows we are fed up with being lied to by the media, we are fed up woke BS, we want babies to be born and not killed during late terms",
         "Actually yeah, all that \u201cthey go low, we go high\u201d bullshit is as quaint and antiquated as \u201cgoing courting in the park\u201d and \u201caffordable housing\u201d.",
         "Yeah im one of em. Cause weve seen what globalists do to a country lmao",
         "Those two things aren't dependant on one another. He can be a felon-in-fact and by law. And have been voted in. Your assumption doesn't have enough data to be supported. \nHe is a felon. He is a sexual abuser. He had full due process. Our system says these things are facts. And refusing to acknowledge legal fact shows a bias against the equity and authority of the US Constitution.",
         "Lmfao \u201clogical\u201d is doing a lot of heavy lifting.",
         "You voted for a criminal????",
         "Regardless of Republican policies and values, Trump is simply not a good candidate. Honestly best case scenario is he croaks before the election and Vance becomes president because we know at least he hates Trump.",
         "By voting for Trump you are killing babies because RFK wants to ban vaccines and Trump would allow it. Thanks to vaccines, the infant mortality rate for pertussis aka whooping cough has decreased by 150 fold.\n\nIf RFK gets his wish, just remember you voted for it, and the blood of every infant that dies from a vaccine preventable disease is on your hands. Along with anyone else who voted for Trump.",
         "Which cities? Remember, imaginary ones don't count.",
         "You can vote for who you want to, and you\u2019re right, he won fair and square (no one is going to try to overturn it like he did). But it\u2019s sad that this man appeals to the poor. He is a product of (and perpetuates) the inequality they experience. He didn\u2019t get shot for you.",
         "So an angry mob busting into the Capitol, fighting with the Capitol police with the express intent of preventing the certification of election results and calling for the murder of the vice president isn't insurrection??\n\nIf that's not insurrection, I don't know what is...",
         "Someone is lying to you and its not the AP or NYT or BBC",
         "Yup.. blame the illegals for it and all the underlying problems just seem to vanish.",
         "That's not a very nice way to talk about the president of the United states.",
         "Too bad the American people know the system you have so much faith in was rigged lol",
         "Read your comment again buddy lol",
         "Technically yea, I did, just like most Americans did.",
         "He got me cheaper Doritos from 2016-2020",
         "That\u2019s a little overly simplistic.\n\nYou gotta ask, how did a party that has been demonstrably bad for the domestic economy since at least Nixon, if not Eisenhower, manage to drive home such a strong economic message?\n\nThe Dems had all the facts and statistics in the world, and they didn\u2019t count for shit.",
         "Yet it is fully correct, factually and legally. So if one votes for a sex abusing felon, they need to make peace with the reality of their choice.",
         "Which American people? How many? Define rigged. What argument are you making here?",
         "I was just confused by you saying \u201cwe like to put people in jail who commit crimes\u201d. He wouldn\u2019t have been my choice but I know price increases are really tough over there so as much as I dislike the guy I hope the economics policies come through and things get better for you all.",
         "How\u2019s the majority sound? Something like say, I don\u2019t know, 71.7 million people? I think we all know exactly what I mean when I say \u201crigged\u201d.",
         "No. Answer my questions. \n\nNo, we all don't. What is \"rigged\"?"
