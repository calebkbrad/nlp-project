         "All I\u2019m saying is if I have to put up with his ass for 4 years my grocery and gas prices better go back to 1999. Isn\u2019t that all they talked about???",
         "Does this timeline make sense to anyone else. The nation has a short memory",
         "First convicted felon president?",
         "People mad about \u201cprices going up the last 4 years\u201d just elected the guy who will give the corporations responsible a free pass to keep going and enrich themselves further",
         "I don't understand how but he's going to win. I thought for sure enough people in this country wouldn't want someone like him again. He's only gotten worse and worse the last four years but he's surged this election and all this support, energy, and enthusiasm for Harris has translated to an absolute cathartic result. \n\nI'm really not sure what to make of this. It's not that it wasn't always a close race but I don't get the wild margins Trump is winning by. Millions of votes in FL and TX and hundreds of thousands in other places, making up huge margin gains in New York. It's like Trump magically gained 10% of the population's vote despite the insurrection, the felonies, and everything else. \n\nI had more faith in our country but history is doomed to repeat itself. This is going to be an election with ripple effects for a generation.",
         "It\u2019s more dire than you can imagine because Republicans have control of House now and Senate. \n\nNo checks and balances. \n\nIt will be full on Project 2025 and Trumps policies and he will serve zero time and all of his charges will be dropped. \n\nIt\u2019s over",
         "America was screwed the moment he was allowed to run again. Not surprising",

I honestly didn't think (and refused to believe) that the country would be so stupid as to put a convicted felon in office that tried to overthrow the government and who thought you could inject bleach into your veins to cure covid-19. \n\nI stand corrected.\n\nIt's possible for Harris to take PA and still lose.",
         "I\u2019m beyond confused and so incredibly lost. It\u2019s like a psychological prison. It doesn\u2019t made sense how all of the evidence of how horrible a person he is, is so acceptable for over half the country. I don\u2019t even know who to trust around me.",

         "This is insane like I don\u2019t think people understand how catastrophic this is. It says a lot about the state of america. A president that incited an insurrection and rejected the peaceful democratic transfer of power will likely end up winning, and that is a sobering realization.",
         "Everyone who voted for Trump deserves everything they get. Feel really bad for you Democrats. This feels like the decline of the US gaining pace, it\u2019s horrific to look at, like a car crash.",
         "Everything they warned us about growing up was in vain. Americas been rotted by a cult of fascists. Hopefully we weather the storm",

         "She lost the popular vote, too.\n\nWhat a historic failure.",
         "So there will no longer be any separation of power. Republicans will control all branches of government in unison to do whatever the hell they want. The great American experiment is over.",

         "We're in the Bizarro America or Anti-America timeline now apparently. I can't imagine how divorced from reality you have to be to think Trump is the better choice, the founding fathers would be ashamed. \n\nReally shows how poor the state of our education and media literacy as a whole is.",
         "I now realize that over half of the US population are idiots",
         "Beginning to?? The past 4 hours have been absolute hell.",
         "The next four years are going to be terrible for the US and the world.",
         "USA has signified that they\u2019re one of the dumbest nations out there. As a Canadian, this is a sad moment. \nA reality TV personality, convicted felon, likely a child molester, rambling idiot, is about to take over government. Well done USA, this timeline is now officially fucked.",
         "People will look at the timeline of this and say Biden should have done X or Harris should have done Y or Dems should have done Z. But when you go through it, if you\u2019re really being honest we\u2019re just fucked. What things or events had any chance of happening recently? Democrats just failed to find a young, strong white guy after Obama and this nation is paying for it. You have to go back at least that far.\n\nAnd if this country is so fucking ignorant as to vote for Trump after everything he\u2019s done and shown himself to be, then we were only staving it off anyway. Slow or quick, however it\u2019s rolled out, fascism, oligarchy, theocracy, general fucking backsliding diminishes us all.\n\nIt\u2019s going to be quicker than people think. Trump has said every awful thing in the fascist textbook and Harris ran as perfect a campaign as possible. And yet here Trump will have the senate and probably the house. A national mandate for all of it. Every awful idea. Given carte blanche for every  bit of his hate and stupidity.\n\nWe\u2019ve lost. Every single citizen has lost in this whether they know it or not. We just elected the first true autocrat and yes it will be different this time. Whatever awful things went into it making, it really has been a shining city on a hill. No longer.",
         "He\u2019s become more hated, she was more liked than Joe, the momentum was higher. These numbers, and the lower voter turnout doesn\u2019t make sense.",
         "For the people who are confused by this, go check the current academic rates of public schools in America.\n\nAfterwards, do me another favor and go check who\u2019s making budgetary cuts to them.",
         "So this is how democracy ends\u2026",
         "America really rewarded this dude for January 6th. Propaganda works. It\u2019s the only thing that matters now.",
         "From a non-american following this whole election process has been nothing short of astounding.  The guy has vast amounts of shit you could point at to tell you he is not a good person, so why would you want him leading your country? Wish the best to all of you.",
         "Silver lining:  Soooo many Trump supporters are going to get burnt badly by Trump polices.  (I know Harris voters will as well).",
         "I didn't actually want any real world evidence that the college kids who said you couldn't get worse for Palestine than Biden and Harris were wrong.",
         "Whatever happens, America fucking deserves this. god damnit. Short attention span brick brained people voting for this guy.",
         "This is an extinction level event for our country",
         "Sad day for America. Half of Americas been conned by fake outrage politics regurgitated by idiots like Ben Shapiro, Joe Rogan, Jordan Peterson, etc.",
         "As someone who isn't american, why do you want Trump to win?",
         "As a Canadian I've lost what remaining respect I had for America. I hope your institutions hold through the assault they're about to endure for these next 4 years to give you another chance, but if not you knew what you were getting into \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",
         "Enjoy your recession America. You deserve it",
         "Didn\u2019t quite expect to wake up to such a one-sided election. Must be a crazy feeling over in the US right now. The Democrats have never looked so weak in my lifetime.",

         "Strap your seat belt, folks. This is going to be a wild ride for the next 4 years+",
         "I didnt think the world could get any worse, or people any stupider  \nSeriously what the FUCK are people thinking voting that lunatic into power again",
         "It's going to be a hard four years. Granted, if he ever leaves again. Never thought I'd see fascism come to America.",
         "And this time we\u2019ll deserve what\u2019s coming. As a country, we had years of evidence showing what he plans to do. \n\nI hope I\u2019m wrong, I hope I\u2019m overreacting. I don\u2019t think I am.",
         "I'm watching Idiocracy again. It's a documentary now.",
         "Then we better fucking see gas and food prices reach pre-covid levels and an immediate end to the Ukrainian war since those are the bullshit promises people think they're voting for, but I suspect the best we'll get is tax cuts for the rich and regressive laws for LGBT and non-white Americans.\n\nGreat job America, you stuck it to the libs or whatever. Now we live with the consequences of our actions. Republicans will have control over every branch of the federal government so let's see whether they can actually do a god damn thing besides cashing out and policing people's lives.",
         "Wow. I thought there was a chance he would win, but I didn\u2019t expect a large margin like this. BUT just goes to show you can never really predict an election, have to wait til everyone has voted.",
         "If Republicans win the presidency & both houses of Congress, I'm officially an athiest. No God would allow this..\u00a0",
         "I don\u2019t think the US understands the impact this will have on Europe.. It\u2019s catastrophic..",
         "Just hope he's focused to much on revenge that he doesn't fuck up things like international politics and the climate",
         "This is our last election .\nThe end of democracy. \n\nWait for China to invade Taiwan and Russia to invade Poland or Finland.",
         "Well when you mostly have uneducated people, they will produce uneducated results, there are a lot of dumbos in this country",
         "Yep. With the Senate and House too. How long till Project 2025 gets passed?",
         "You know what? Progressives are wrong. It turns out campaigning on transphobia and being anti-immigrant is actually extremely popular.\n\nYou can call an entire race of people trash and they\u2019ll still vote for you over the woman who hangs out with people who say Latinx.",
         "So, there seem to be some gloating Trump voters in here.  Tell us, why?   Why did you vote for him?  Just don't like Kamala for president?   Were you around for the first time, from 2016--2020?  You thought that was good times?",
         "[deleted]",
         "Well, now we just wait for the shitstorm, yeah?",
         "What's worse is the very real possibility that Republicans might have control of the House, Senate, the courts and the White House simultaneously. The only thing more scary than a Trump presidency is a Trump presidency with virtually unchecked power.",
         "He\u2019s a rapist who wants to ban abortion and hand over control of health to a maniac. \n\nYet women vote for him for safety\u2026.. \n\nYour all going to get what you deserve\u2026.",
         "We can't downplay the misogyny that had a part in this. Clinton was way more qualified than Trump and it still didn't matter. Harris isn't a rapist felon and it still didn't matter. America has said \"fuck women\" over and over again.",
         "So how long until republicans try and repeal the 19th and 22nd amendments?",
         "Well, it's all rigged, right?",
         "We're going to have a Republican House, a Republican Senate, a Republican president, and a Conservative Supreme Court.\n\nNo hyperbole. No exaggeration. It is literally the worst-case scenario. My heart is breaking for everyone who will be affected by this.",
         "I just feel, so defeated. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever felt a level of despondency in my life than at this moment. Life just feels lost.",
         "248 years. Good run chaps.",
         "How are Americans so dumb??",
         "Absolutely zero faith in humanity",
         "We failed as Americans",
         "As an Australian we have been watching what we thought for sure was going to a big slide towards Kamala, as we honestly thought that no-one in their right mind would vote for Trump again.  So shocked.\n\nA network here did a fun online survey stating if we were American, who would we vote for?  It was 92% Kamala, 4% Trump and 4% Neither.  \n\nGood luck USA.  Think you\u2019re going to need it.",
         "It makes me fucking sick. People have no idea what\u2019s to come.",
         "I\u2019m sorry, but you had one fucking job America. And it wasn\u2019t even a difficult one. \n\nWhatever happens from here is your own fault.",
         "What the fuck America.... What the fuck... Ukraine is fucked. What a catastrophy",
         "Dude raped and stole and grifted and tried to overthrow an election and it warmed the cockles of America's heart, apparently.",
         "Fuck this goddamn fucking country for being so goddamn fucking stupid!!",
         "Trump has said:\n\n\u201cthe termination of all rules ... even those found in the Constitution.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe says, \u2018You\u2019re not going to be a dictator, are you?\u2019 I said: \u2018No, no, no, other than day one. We\u2019re closing the border, and we\u2019re drilling, drilling, drilling. After that, I\u2019m not a dictator.\u2019\u201d\n\n\"We pledge to you that we will root out the communists, Marxists, fascists, and the radical left thugs that live like vermin within the confines of our country,\"\n\n\"STOP THE COUNT\" (of ballots)\n\n\"in four years, you don't have to vote again. We'll have it fixed so good, you're not gonna have to vote.\"\n\n\"It's freezing and snowing in New York - we need global warming!\"\n\n\"He's now president for life. President for life. No, he's great. And look, he was able to do that. I think it's great. Maybe we'll have to give that a shot some day.\"\n\n\"Now, if I don\u2019t get elected, it\u2019s going to be a bloodbath, for the whole \u2014 that\u2019s going to be the least of it. It\u2019s going to be a bloodbath for the country.\"\n\n\"The Democrats say, 'Please don't call them animals. They're humans.' I said, 'No, they're not humans, they're not humans, they're animals,'\"\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not a war hero. He was a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren\u2019t captured.\u201d\n\n\"We are going to win four more years. And then after that, we'll go for another four years because they spied on my campaign. We should get a redo of four years.\"\n\n\"And 52 days from now we're going to win Nevada, and we're going to win four more years in the White House. And then after that, we'll negotiate, right? Because we're probably -- based on the way we were treated -- we are probably entitled to another four after that.\"\n\n\"(The US is) like a garbage can for the rest of the world.\"\n\n\"Today we\u2019re like a third-world country. We\u2019re literally like a third-world country,\u201d\n\n\nVance has said:\n\n\"That does not magically make them legal because Kamala Harris waved the amnesty wand. That makes her border policy a disgrace, and I'm still going to call people illegal aliens,\u201d when asked if he would deport legal immigrants.\n\n\n\u201cWhen you go to the polls in this country as a parent, you should have more power \u2014 you should have more of an ability to speak your voice in our democratic republic \u2014 than people who don\u2019t have kids. Let\u2019s face the consequences and the reality: If you don\u2019t have as much of an investment in the future of this country, maybe you shouldn\u2019t get nearly the same voice.\u201d\n\n\nVance complained that the U.S. was being run by Democrats, corporate oligarchs and \"a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too.\"\n\nSo excited for this.",
         "your American system where everyone doesn\u2019t have to vote is very broken for this time and age especially what\u2019s at stake, let\u2019s hope the world is ready for 4 more years of this bullshit",

There never was a democracy yet that did not commit suicide.\n\nMy faith in democracy died long ago but to witness it die with the rise of this tyrant, i am upon the verge of tears.",
         "Good night and good luck from Europe",
         "I fear that there is now going to be a moral and economic leadership vaccume in the West which will lead to a fracturing of the traditional western bloc. This will embolden China, Russia and Iran (and others) to act with impunity while the traditional keepers of the status quo are distracted and demoralised",
         "Just....how?\n\nI don't get it. He's done everything wrong. Alienates women, is a rapist, a pedophile, has economic policies that will ruin America, open rallies against the very concept of democracy.\n\nHow can he win even the popular vote? Why weren't any of the above deal breakers? What the fuck happened?",
         "As a european I just can't wrap my head around this. He's a criminal, he's not even allowed to vote himself? Fuck climate I guess, it's not a problem until we see it!!! (and it's too late).

They deserve to go into economic hardship. They deserve the homelessness, the lack of food, worsening inflation, lack of access to most electronics (our only chip manufacturer is Intel and they're about to go under). They deserve to have their health care gutted. They deserve the illness that will spread in their communities when RFK (a disgrace to the Kennedy name) guts the health care industry.\n\nEvery bad thing to come, MAGA deserves to suffer through.",

In the privacy of their voting booths, people will let their inner racist xenophobic sexist do the voting, while telling polls they will vote for the liberal progressive. Also, he won the immigrant votes because, guess what, immigrants don't want more immigrants competing for their immigrant jobs. He won the Muslim vote, because the genocide happened on Dems watch. He won the Jewish vote, because he will support Israel towards exterminating Palestinians in Gaza and settling there. He won the women vote again against a female candidate....again, because it turns out that women buy groceries more than they get abortions, and a recent hike -whether orchestrated or not- has magnified the \"economy is sinking\" claim that Elon was propagating. Speaking of which, most importantly, and this is big, Elon invested heavily in fake news propagation, including sending fake texts to conservatives which impersonate the Harris campaign in a very sneaky way that makes it legal. It's the \"Trump factor\" that forecasters haven't experienced. I knew that being a convicted felon, speaking tirelessly about being robbed and enticing an insurrection won't hurt him one bit.",

Federal Election Commission in 2010 significantly changed the landscape of campaign finance in the United States. The Court ruled that corporate funding of independent political broadcasts in candidate elections cannot be limited under the First Amendment. This decision effectively allowed corporations and unions to spend unlimited amounts of money on political campaigns, leading to the rise of Super PACs (Political Action Committees).\n\nI would add a third important decision by the Supreme Court helped to chip away at democracy and pave way to autocracy.

That's why I hated the narrative going into 2024 that \"well we had a record turnout in 2024 so Harris is going to have that support.\" \n\nAll Trump had to do was flip some people or cause some people to stay home. It's not like he lost by a significant amount in 2020, he would have won literally every other election in history.",

People can not do their own research to see that Biden is slowly fixing things one step at a time. \n\nThey see it differently. They don't see that the whole world is having an inflation problem and that we had it easier, especially when it comes to groceries, because we are a net exporter for food. \n\nPeople are dumb, but Americans take the cake. \nCongratulations, they destroy their own path forward. \n\nMark my world.

         "There are A LOT of middle class people in GenX and Boomer age that vote Red no matter what because they vote \u201cfiscally\u201d or simple because of religion.  Neither of which makes sense if they\u2019re ever seen Trump speak once paid attention to any policy.\n\nI also don\u2019t fathom how any women or person of minority could possibly vote for someone like Trump, but NBC openly said Trump was doing great with Latino men and other minorities.",
         "It\u2019s not that easy to move to another country.  You have to be really well off to do it.  For all the talk about it, not many people actually looked into the steps it would take or determined whether other countries would actually take them in.",

No way does her being a part of Biden's term weigh against her, because Biden's term was, by all metrics controllable by the administration, far more successful than Trump's.",

For starters, NC has a very long history of having a moderate Democrat governor while going red for President.  \n\nAlso, that Robinson guy was so catastrophically bad as a candidate that polls were showing him losing by like 15-20 points.  If he was only moderately bad he might have driven Democratic turnout to defeat him\u2026..but it\u2019s been obvious for weeks he was going to lose like 55% - 40%.

Not only did they lean on the scale in 2016, in 2020 the entire party mobilized to stop him getting the nomination. These are just facts.",
         "Bro what? Iowa isn't everything, after Bernie won New Hampshire and especially Nevada, many mainstream media outlets were saying he was the frontrunner with the most momentum.

Looking at the data on google they use historical data to pre determine the results of a state online. If only 40% precincts have reported for a state how do they know a states results with certainty?\n\nI can see this with a number of reporting precincts correlating with the number of remaining voters becoming a mathematical impossibility for the vote to swing back to another candidate.  But then when I checked Mississippi on the map on google it had 4% of precincts reporting but had already given the state to trump? \n\nI\u2019m just asking because I feel like this is part of why people think a states vote was defrauded.

But \"Latinx\" is a major unforced error by Democrats. As a native Spanish speaker who\u2019s been around Latinos my whole life, even the most progressive ones I know react to \"Latinx\" with a serious eye-roll. The typical response? \u201cWhite people really need to stop.\u201d While the term wasn\u2019t initially coined by white people, once they saw a few Latino voices championing it, it was quickly weaponized, irritating the majority of Latinos even more.\n\nIs this single issue costing Democrats the election?

With republicans getting the senate, house, executive and a supreme court supermajority, it should be interesting to see just how much harm america can inflict on itself in two years.  If only the us were a small, economically and militarily insignificant nation I wouldnt care so much, but we\u2019ll also get to see how much the us can fuck up the rest of the world whilst he\u2019s at it.\n\nI\u2019m just fucking angry that i have to read about that idiot\u2019s fuckups for another 4 years (if vance doesn\u2019t take over sooner).\n\nI don\u2019t understand the usa any more\u2026.

         "Even through the last 8 years, I've held onto the notion that deep down, America stands for ideals such as freedom, equality, democracy, scientific excellence, innovation, and that the best of America rises above the racism, sexism and hate that still plague us. I'm not the biggest Biden fan but I bought into his \"soul of the nation\" argument, all the speeches and rhetoric about \"who we really are\". That veil has shattered now, more so than in 2016. America can't stand for these ideals when more than half of Americans reject them and choose the opposite.",

I'm done fighting.\n\nI can no longer care about people who don't care about themselves.\n\nI can no longer fight on behalf of people who not only will not fight for themselves, but will actively fight against me while I fight to better their lives.\n\nI'm done. I don't care anymore.",

         "The USA is dead as we knew it.",
         "No Jon, we are tired of always having to fight. And this just proves that most of America is exactly what we are fighting against and there is a level of apathy in the non-voting population that does not care one bit. \n\nThat said, there are a few ways I will conduct my business to make it harder for the coming oligarchy to reign; for starters, delete Twitter.  Just don't give that platform any ad revenue. Tank its user base and let those corporations find some place else to go. Elmo does not need more help than he can get.  \n\nHoard money.  Just save as much money as you can. Buy local, buy used when applicable, learn to do things yourself as much as possible.\n\nTake care of your health.  Eat right and exercise.\n\nWe don't know how much fuckery the right is going to do to elections going forward, but if you can move from a red state to a swing state, maybe try for that, but if you truly feel vulnerable and can manage it, move to a blue state.  The issue with moving from a red to a blue state is it further stratifies the divide between how many red states there are versus blue states which then sends more power to the Senate towards the republicans. There are far more red states than blue states.\n\nLastly, just love your loved ones. Hold them and protect them.  Cherish all the good times you will have going forward, and yes, even amongst the coming misery, there will be good times as well. Value those moments. This malaise will last for a bit, but eventually you will recenter yourself. So don't lose hope, stay active with friends and family, and take the positives when you can.",
         "I don\u2019t understand. What happened to the \u201cblue wave\u201d momentum? It seemed like so many people were turning out for Harris so how is orange turd still leading the popular votes????????? Did people jsut go to her rallies to see the celebs? For a free concert?",

I am honestly glad my mother isn't here to see this fucking country let her down again.\u00a0\n\n\nThat orange and disgusting waste has fueled and bolstered the absolute worst aspects of this country and yet so many of these \"people\" clamored and tripped over themselves to put him back where he demonstrably doesn't belong.\n\n\nI can't take this anymore.

         "I cried in 2016. I was devastated. I have had no tears this time. Just disgust, rage and fear.\n\nThe America I grew up in was more than a nation. It was a promise. A promise to fight for justice and lift our people and the world up. It was an acknowledgement of the ugly parts of our past, pride in our achievements and a belief that we could accomplish anything.\n\nThat America died today.\n\nStewart is wrong.",

Everyone is severely underestimating the mental exhaustion millennials have dealing with Trump over the last 9 years or so.",
         "We can scream at people all we want Jon, I talked to everyone I talked to about this fucking election, but they're just too damn busy or dumb to actually get out and fucking vote!  \n\nThat will be the narrative when the dust settles.  Low turnout , despite all you heard.",

         "The DNC stuck with Biden for entirely too long. They had a blueprint for beating Trump from 2020 and they chose the 2016 game plan at the last second. The average voter votes with their feelings, not their policy positions, and moderates want a younger, charismatic, and safe option. Another older, extremely progressive woman with an annoying laugh was never going to win this election. Best you can hope for at this point is a repeat of Trumps first term where he doesn\u2019t do anything or follow through on any of his promises",

         "> Shall we expect some transatlantic military giant to step the ocean and crush us at a blow? Never! All the armies of Europe, Asia, and Africa combined, with all the treasure of the earth (our own excepted) in their military chest, with a Bonaparte for a commander, could not by force take a drink from the Ohio or make a track on the Blue Ridge in a trial of a thousand years. At what point then is the approach of danger to be expected? I answer. If it ever reach us it must spring up amongst us; it cannot come from abroad. If destruction be our lot we must ourselves be its author and finisher.

You have helped effectively doom not only Gaza, but Ukraine, and our own country. Way to let perfect be the enemy of good. Now we are stuck with Trump, a red Senate, a red House, and a red Supreme Court. Not to mention Project 2025. I'm plenty mad at Republicans as well, but we expected them to be morally bankrupt.

         "Fight for.... what exactly? The idea of American exceptionalism?  Well I hate to break it to Jon, but American exceptionalism isn't a history of exceptionalism at all.  It's a history of greed and mistreatment.\n\nWe're a nation built on slavery, war, civil rights violations, and over consumption.  Our main benefit over other nations seems to just be that we're on a continent that's difficult to invade that is resource rich.\n\nKnow how everyone is real worried about climate change right now?  The US has topped the charts for worst GHG emitters per capita on the planet for the past 150 years straight.  We are the world's foremost cause of climate change.  But we Americans are better than the rest of the world, we're exceptional, which is why we've all decided to give up flying for vacations, give up driving SUVS, and we all agreed to limit our HVAC and hot water use to what's tolerable rather than what's perfect.  Oh and we've all limited our consumption of beef of course!\n\nWait... we've all done those things right?  It's not just me?  Nah, the vast majority of us have done absolutely none of those things because we're Americans, exceptional Americans!  We're the best.  We're the good.\n\nHow about modern wars since WWII?  Vietnam.  Korean.  Iraq.  Afghanistan.  Ukraine.  Israel/Gaza (a genocide, not a war).  The US has either directly taken part in these, or has at least had their hands in all of them.  We're exceptional at war and killing.  Our military spending is more than the next 10 largest military spending nations!\n\nWe also have a long history of foreign regime changes to those who are more willing to support our bid to mine / buy their resources... can't forget about that!\n\nOh right right, it's not our international or planetary policy that makes us exceptional... it's our social policy!  A history of slavery and civil rights violations, but that's in the past.  We're not currently still dealing with racism, sexism, homophobia, xenophobia, and sexism!  We're far too exceptional for that. /s  \n\nWhen Democrats, the party of good, had a super majority, the last time being in 2009 during Obama, they couldn't be bothered with codifying abortion rights, or real single payer universal healthcare, or reparations for ancestors of slaves, or immigration policy, or even helping the little guy instead of corporations during a recession.  They did pass Obamacare real fast though, which seems to have done almost nothing to control our healthcare costs that are among the highest in the world.\n\nHow about this election... it seems we've elected Trump again, a geriatric convicted felon, rapist, fraud businessman who in his last term attempted to lead an insurrection and destroy US Democracy, and whom his own administration cabinet doesn't support.  Funny enough, as far as I can tell, many of his supporters don't even care about politics or know anything about actual policy... many are literally just voting for him to troll the US and the liberals / establishment / elite.  They're upset, they're angry, and they want to own the libs / establishment.  That's the extent of it of their justification for voting Trump.  That's a sign of being exceptional, FYI...\n\nOh right, Democracy... THAT's what truly makes us exceptional.  Except that the electoral college is clearly corrupt, and our winner take all system is also easily corrupted to give results that aren't representative of the voter demographics, whether districts are gerrymandered or not.  Other nations do representation far better than us, where every vote truly matters.  In the US, if your district votes 50.01% to 49.99%, and you're on the 49.99% side, your vote automatically gets counted as going to the other candidate as if you supported and voted for them and their policies.  Isn't that nice everyone?!\n\nMeanwhile, those people who fight against the two party system, and for real change, or stand up to a given party and demand changes, they're listed as the problem by the status quo voters.  Those that have continuously voted for the status quo, leading to the US largely stagnating in social policy while our politicians fleece us financially by passing every policy the corporations and super wealthy want them too, they're the folks who are clearly the most exceptional.\n\nI get it, I see why Jon wants to push a message of hope... but his message of hope is based on the misguided idea that the US is actually exceptional.  It's not.  If anything, the US has been a virus on this planet... completely engulfed by personal greed and a capitalistic system that has us living outside of the bounds of what this planet and its life and people can sustain.  If we're exceptional at anything, it's exceptional at taking and destroying.\n\n....\n\nNow get on those planes without a second thought and go on vacation all of you and emit those truckloads of CO2 into the atmosphere... because we deserve it for being so GD exceptional!",

You can\u2019t inherit an economy where the unemployment boost was $400 a week on top of what you were getting. Followed by stimulus checks. Crushing the oil industry and everything else due to lack of expenses because everyone was sitting at home. Everyone sitting at home sat with unemployment  and applied for jobs they normally would not to continue getting unemployment. It deprived the market of jobs forcing pay to increase, therefor jacking prices up. Then he runs on the slogan we\u2019re you better off 4 years ago? Well I was\u2026 being paid $850 a week with literally no expense\u2026. So yeah, but was America? This generation acts like Trump have us all this money and fixed the stock market. The GameStop spike happened because everyone had unemployment money, laws that they couldn\u2019t be evicted etc. Robinhood was letting people buy fractions of a share and we saw how much extra money was pumped into the stock market. Then when they needed their money back because they aren\u2019t investing like the wall street guys and fixing a car can be expensive they pulled their cash out, opening back up for Wall Street to buy cheap again.

Does this sound a little familiar?\n\nEdit: ~~So he effectively staged a coup within PayPal while someone was on their honeymoon.~~  He started *forcing* his changes, and they ousted him while he was on his honeymoon.  Does this sound a little familiar?\n\nHe got kicked out of the company.  He was effectively given a \"fuck off fee\".  They wanted him gone so badly *they paid him to leave*.\n\nHe is still trying, nearly 30 years later, to prove that he was right all along.

So once he was convinced to drop it went to Harris since she was the only person that really made any sense, being Biden\u2019s VP. They took Obama\u2019s VP and he won so take Biden\u2019s VP and hope she can win.\n\nBut she is a terrible candidate, far worse than Biden was in 2020, far worse than Trump is, and somehow managed to perform worse than Hillary Clinton, who I thought was the worst Democratic candidate we\u2019ve had since Mondale.\n\nBut in pretty much every single state she has done worse than Hillary. Trump is expected to win every swing state on the map and, while he didn\u2019t win and wouldn\u2019t have, got frighteningly close to Virginia and New Hampshire, and now I think the margin of victory in New York is under 10% for Harris. Single digits in New York is insane. She hardly won Minnesota, which is where her running mate is from. That should\u2019ve been an easy win. I wonder how this election would\u2019ve played out if she had chosen Josh Shapiro, though after this I\u2019m imagining at best she gets PA and Trump gets MN.\n\nAnd not only did she do worse in easy to win blue states, but Trump ended her in red ones. In 2016 and 2020, he won Texas by 9 points and 5.6 points respectively. This time, he won it by well over 10 points (I wanna say close to 15). Florida was even more insane, he flipped it in 2016 and won by 1.3 points, and won in 2020 by 3.4 points, and this time he won by 13 whole points.\n\nHe also has a very good chance right now at winning the popular vote, and the Senate has gone to Republicans, the presidency has gone to republicans, and the house is close but it could very well go red majority. This was a landslide victory for Republicans and Trump, and she was destroyed.\n\nOutside of the results, the only thing I know now is that the careers of Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are virtually over.",
         "whatever.  Your boy's message is hate, division, removing freedoms, and money for him and his few buddies.  That's his entire message and goals in a nutshell.    You don't understand hers?   It's the opposite of all of that and she's been saying it every day since she started running.  \n\nSome of you just haven't had 4 to 12 years of her rampaging in election mode like you have had from Trump.

Did anyone on the left want \"the most lethal military\", or to be tougher on the border after years of mocking Trump's wall, or to be against universal healthcare? Not banning fracking? And would anyone upset about that messaging be happy with such insanely targeted policies like tax breaks for small business startups, or vague statements like saying we need an \"opportunity economy\"? This messaging was terrible and I can understand why people would feel unenthusiastic even if I personally still wanted her to win over Trump. It is the campaign's job to make people want to go out, and she squandered such massive enthusiasm from when Biden dropped out in some bizarre quest to find people who want to hear that the Cheneys of all people endorsed her.",

You folks recovered industries from COVID and have managed to handle inflation faster and better than almost every other major economy. Wages are high, unemployment is low, businesses are thriving, stock market is doing great etc.. The statistics don't lie, and to claim the US economy is \"bad\" is to misunderstand macroeconomics.\n\nBut, as you very well point out, there's a lot of working and middle class Americans who aren't seeing this wealth. Their rents, mortgages, grocery and gas prices have gone up, and they're finding it tougher to manage their finances day to day. I think this is something Democrats have to understand in their messaging: telling people that they're wrong about the economy when their wallets are bleeding come across as arrogant and disdainful.\n\nAnd the truth of the matter is, any Dem candidate would have to deal with this. Incumbents are getting crushed across the globe, largely due to unhappiness with inflation and rising costs.

Unlike every modern-day U.S. president before him who helped build up America\u2019s awe-inspiring system of public lands and waters, President Trump has pursued an agenda aimed at removing protections from vast swaths of public lands and waters.

That means the Interior Department \u2014 a vast agency that oversees public lands, the national parks, Western water conservation and endangered species protections \u2014 is sure to witness drastic policy shifts if Trump reclaims the White House in January.\n\n4. https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/sep/28/trump-oil-national-parks-wildlife-election  \n\n    >Indeed, early plans suggest that Trump aims to radically remake the Department of the Interior, which oversees more than 500m acres (200m hectares) of public lands, manages the country\u2019s national parks and wildlife refuges, and is responsible for protecting endangered species. Whereas Joe Biden made safeguarding public lands and the transition to green energy a centerpiece of his time in office, Trump and his allies would reverse many of Biden\u2019s policies, remake the civil service and implement a new agenda focused on slashing regulations, weakening environmental protections, and expanding oil and gas development across the American west.\n\n5. https://suwa.org/trumps-assault-utah-monuments-leaves-millions-acres-limbo/  \n\n    >President Trump\u2019s repeal of Grand Staircase-Escalante and Bears Ears National Monuments on December 4, 2017 represents the single greatest attack a president has ever launched against America\u2019s federal public lands.

Happens every time the election is close",
         "Yes. Rural counties are more red and have lower populations so the votes are counted a lot faster than the dem leaning counties with large cities and high population.

Same with mail in votes which are more likely to be democrat and some states don\u2019t allow to be counted until all Election Day votes are counted, but that should be less extreme this time. And then in general polls close earlier on the east coast and there are more red states there\n\nYou can basically add about 80 EC votes to the dem candidate right away as the west coast has states that are deep blue and haven\u2019t even started counting.

Norton's funeral on Saturday, January 10, was solemn, mournful, and large. Paying their respects were members of \"all classes from capitalists to the pauper, the clergyman to the pickpocket, well-dressed ladies and those whose garb and bearing hinted of the social outcast\".\u00a0The next day, the\u00a0*San Francisco Chronicle*\u00a0reported, under the headline \"Le Roi Est Mort,\" that some 10,000 people had come to view the emperor's body in advance of the 2 p.m. funeral.\n\nWikipedia",

         "Email from Simon Rosenberg 11:41pm:\n\nThe Harris-Walz Campaign Chair Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon just released this statement:\n\nTeam,\n\nAs polls close across the country, I wanted to give everyone an update on what we\u2019re seeing. As we have known all along, this is a razor thin race. Thanks to this amazing team, we have seen incredible turnout across the Battleground States, and the closeness of the race is exactly what we prepared for.\n\nWhile we continue to see data trickle in from the Sun Belt states, we have known all along that our clearest path to 270 electoral votes lies through the Blue Wall states. And we feel good about what we\u2019re seeing.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, we overperformed turnout expectations in Philadelphia, and overperformed in our early vote expectations in Bucks County. We don\u2019t have Election Day results from Philadelphia, but we do know that we overperformed turnout expectations there, and have seen specially high turnout in places with large non-white and student populations. We expect to see higher turnout in Philadelphia than in 2020. Outside of Philadelphia, we have limited data on turnout and support right now, but what we do have is tracking with our expectations. We are awaiting more results (like everyone else!), and hope to get a closer read in the coming hours.\n\nIn Michigan, we are awaiting a significant amount of votes to come in. The City of Detroit won\u2019t be reported out until roughly midnight, but we have seen strong turnout throughout early vote and Election Day there. Other results in Michigan are harder to parse, since results are coming in more piece-meal than elsewhere.\n\nIn Wisconsin, we know there is a significant amount of vote remaining in Dane and Milwaukee counties, and we are seeing signs of strong performance in the WOW counties, where we have partial data. We don\u2019t expect complete results from Wisconsin until tomorrow morning between 3 am - 5 am.\n\nPolls just closed in Nevada and Arizona so, as expected, it will be a while before we have more information from both states.\n\nWe\u2019ve been saying for weeks that this race might not be called tonight.

         "Now we\u2019re at the part of the election where everything starts to move real slow. So let\u2019s break it down. \n\nThe most sensible path for Harris to win (which was agreed upon by virtually all pollsters) is Maine, New Mexico, Nebraska-2, Virginia, New Hampshire, Minnesota, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania.\n\nVirginia and New Mexico just called for Harris. \n\nMaine is absolutely crawling right now. We probably won\u2019t get their results tonight. \n\nMichigan is not looking great but still a long ways to go. Still several hundred thousand votes in Wayne County that need counting. By no means time to panic. \n\nPennsylvania is for Trump but he\u2019s running out of votes. The vast majority of votes left are from the Philly metro, that will be at a minimum another +200,000 vote margin for Harris. There are still large Harris chunks in Pittsburgh and in Cambria County. Trump\u2019s last gasp is York County- which has been a Republican stronghold for half a century. But Trump\u2019s margin here so far is a fraction of what it was in 2020. I don\u2019t know where the counted votes in York County have came from, but if this pattern continues, that would probably win Pennsylvania for Harris. But if the Philadelphia turnout was as high as advertised, she\u2019s got it.\n\nMinnesota will likely be called for Harris soon. She\u2019s up almost 150,000 votes and we\u2019re yet to count from Ramsey County yet. \n\nDespite being predicted to go to Republicans, NE-2 is looking good for Harris. She\u2019s up 20,000 votes with most votes counted. \n\nHarris has a healthy lead in New Hampshire. About 26,000 votes. It should be enough but we\u2019re still waiting on some Boston bedroom communities- namely Salem, Bedford, and Hudson. These usually lean Republican, but usually not by +10,000 vote margins, and Bedford flipped blue in 2020.\n\nWisconsin is a bit tricky because its precincts send results a bit at a time, so when it says that 76% of votes are counted, it means that approximately 76% of each county\u2019s votes are counted. Some early and late of course but it\u2019s a good bit more evenly spread than other states. Harris is down 100,000 votes. But there is one straggling county moving slower than the rest: Milwaukee. Conservatively, a +150,000 swing from Milwaukee\u2019s remaining votes should help. \n\nBut there\u2019s a problem. When Biden won Wisconsin, he pulled decent support in two Republican-leaning suburban counties: Racine and Kenosha. He didn\u2019t win them- he pulled roughly 47% in each, but that was enough to win the election. Harris is pulling 47% in Kenosha, but only 36% in Racine. If that trend doesn\u2019t improve, it may be the election. \n\nIf Wisconsin doesn\u2019t move for Harris, the she must win both Arizona and Nevada. Nevada probably won\u2019t be releasing counts for another few hours- most pollsters have it in a dead heat. Trump has about an 11,000 vote lead, but Harris is definitely in play. She\u2019s putting up better percentages than Biden so far in Maricopa, Pima, and Coconino County- but I will caution that these counties are gigantic and it\u2019s not easy to tell where these votes are coming from. \n\nSo, to conclude. It\u2019s not a disaster. It\u2019s not what anyone hoped for. But it\u2019s not a disaster. This was predicted to be a close race that would come down to the wire and that\u2019s exactly what happened. \n\nWe can talk about the vibes of this election and it\u2019s importance, but at the end of the day it\u2019s a game of turnout. And the turnout in several swing states- most particularly Georgia, were significantly lower than in 2020. That\u2019s the problem",

Rogan wasn\u2019t really up my alley, I was an alt-comedy fan, but he was one of the people putting out the most content at that time, multiple 2-3 hour shows a week, and it was almost all fairly interesting and usually funny. So I became a weekly listener (like you, I skipped most MMA stuff, also I could never stomach Joey Diaz) and while I fell off a bit as I got older, I was still tuning in for pretty much any guest I was mildly interested in. \n\nBut around the 2016 election he started getting weird about Hillary. I was hearing the exact thing you\u2019re describing, he\u2019d discuss criticisms of Hillary extensively and just ignore any counterpoints, or hypocrisy from the right. Got obsessed with her emails (never gave a fuck when Trump did the same thing), got obsessed with Benghazi. You could just feel a shift away from being open minded to wanting to push a very clear political agenda. And then he doubled down during covid. And then he doubled down again this year. \n\nHe\u2019s a clown. Glad I got out, I\u2019m embarrassed that I was ever in his tent to begin with.",

Thank them.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t share things before checking your sources,\u201d he added.\n\nAnd finally, \u201cLet the process run its course. It takes time to count every ballot.\u201d\n\nMore than 82 million voters cast early ballots this year, which is slightly more than half the total turnout in the presidential election in 2020, according to The Associated Press.\n\nStates have different rules dictating when and how ballots must be counted. Some states have changed their rules since 2020, which could change the timing of when results come in.\n\nIn 2020, the race was not officially called for days after the election, leading experts to preemptively warn the public against expecting to know the results of the race on Tuesday night. Experts also warn that early poll returns do not necessarily indicate the trajectory of the entire election.\n\nVice President Harris and former President Trump are entering Election Day in what polls indicate could be the closest race in recent history.\n\nAccording to The Hill/Decision Desk HQ polling aggregate, Trump and Harris are tied nationally, with 48.4 percent support each.",

I used two forms of protection, ended up unlucky.  I aborted at 6 weeks and 3 days. At that point, it was a clump of cells - to me, it felt like a cancerous tumor. My worst nightmare. I just wanted it out. It\u2019s the smartest decision I\u2019ve ever made. \n\nSure you could say that I should abstain, but i can point to two specific examples in my life where that wasn\u2019t my option. I didn\u2019t have a choice to say no.I\u2019ve been trying to have a tubal ligation for a decade, been denied by six doctors for being too young, because my \u201chusband (I\u2019m single) might want them, or because I needed my DAD to sign off. I\u2019m 27. Why on earth would that be necessary. One said yes but due to the long state mandated waiting period, I had to move states before my appointment date. \n\nWhile I shared my experience, women don\u2019t owe you and explanation and It\u2019s not your place to tell someone else how to process a big life decision like that.",

Harris is behind right now...and then NY will finish counting and suddenly she'll leap ahead, a few smaller states will finish and Trump will go back etc. etc. Happens all the time since like...FDR?\n\n2: Florida was never really in play and this is specifically by design by the GOP; not only do they have a true believer in DeSantis but he has actively been trying to make the state a worse place in order to drive out anyone more liberal/progressive than a Confederate General. If it wasn't for all the tourist trap places setting up shop way back when, FL would probably be one of the poorest, most abandoned states in the US and they know it.\n\n3: Everyone thought Biden was losing too; until he suddenly wasn't. Calm down.\n\n**EDIT:** Point 4: This was always very likely to be a close election with a good chance of Trump legitimately winning, even if myself and others think he won't. When it's a razor's edge like this, little things going wrong (or right) can tip the balance, so best laid plans and all.

One more fact, it takes a lot longer for one county to count 1.5 million votes in that county than it does for 100 rural backwaters to count 10,000 votes in each county.  The small, rural areas, always report quick.  The Democrats vote comes in big chunks much later.  \n\nIt\u2019s gonna be a long night.  This is very close.",

Vs hundreds of thousands in other states without a call.\n\nBy 10pm or midnight tonight unless it's very close there should be one state that helps tip the scales and we all should know a lot more.",

He mocked Biden for being old and mentally infirm, and he repeatedly mispronounced Harris\u2019s name and insulted her intelligence. At times, he echoed rhetoric from Nazi Germany and, more recently, falsely declared himself \u201cthe father of IVF\u201d and promised to protect women, \u201cwhether the women like it or not.\u201d\n\n> A week ago Sunday, at what was supposed to be his triumphant Madison Square Garden rally in a city that had never fully accepted him, Trump\u2019s speech was overshadowed by a comedian who appeared before him and described Puerto Rico as \u201ca floating island of garbage.\u201d Trump was livid, saying the comment \u2014 and ensuing days of negative headlines \u2014 was an unforced error in the final days, two people close to him said.\n\n> Yet for much of the campaign, Trump offered a message of xenophobia and misogyny and racism, of cruelty and darkness and hate. If he wins, it will be because enough of the nation embraced that message, too. And if he loses, it will be because enough of the nation voted against that message \u2014 and Trump himself.\n\nexcerpted from (possibly  paywalled) article: \n\n[In the final stretch before Election Day, Trump \u2014 to the chagrin of many aides and allies \u2014 has seemed unable to curb his worst impulses.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/11/05/trump-final-days-2024-campaign/?utm_campaign=wp_the7&utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&carta-url=https%3A%2F%2Fs2.washingtonpost.com%2Fcar-ln-tr%2F3f88b4c%2F672a079009757d7432beb443%2F60d1f4309bbc0f32a3467c8e%2F29%2F107%2F672a079009757d7432beb443)",

He can then arrive for sentencing in NYC and face the music in his other matters.\n\nHis family, noticeably absent in this campaign, are likely considering whether or not to rat him out to prosecutors in order to save their skins. \n\nHis MAGA sycophants will be falling all over each other to back-stab themselves out of this shit show and it will be most amusing.

You're getting carried away. \n\nObama was quite a bit more effective at winning hearts and minds. He didn't have the benefit of his opponent being the most repugnant human being on earth. He hadn't been VP for 4 years. He was the underdog and rose meteorically because of his rhetorical skill, his agreeable, common sense and sensible persona, and a massively innovative campaign leveraging the internet (during the onset of Web 2.0 days) in unprecedented ways, basically writing a new playbook for every political campaign of the following 18 years. His team combined data science and grassroots mobilization and globally recognizable branding to get our first African American president elected. He was a fucking rock star.\n\nKamala hasn't come anywhere close to that. She's borrowed some of those moves, which have been refined over almost 2 decades, and she's wisely followed his lead in approaching controversial issues with caution and consideration. But she has barely broken through all the noise Trump creates. She's going to be a great President (assuming the country doesn't fuck this up) but she's largely being propelled by people's hatred of Trump because even though she has made the effort to explain what she stands for, most people don't feel like they've heard her.

Then accept a limited amount on a year basis; no more than we can handle.

If dems lose abortion as their main political cudgel they will get absolutely reamed. \n\nThe messaging is just a mess. Dems really need to figure out a better way to speak to the voting base, the nagging and scolding is not working.

And now we elected him. There will be consequences\u2026 consequences that will likely lead to bloodshed worldwide, but especially bloodshed to everyone that\u2019s ever pushed against him. It\u2019s like the entire country just saw a kid walking into a school with a handgun and voted to give him an Apache helicopter and now we\u2019re supposed to think that with a stern talking to we can set it right and convince the school shooter to not shoot?",

         "Nobody forgot - it\u2019s just nobody cared.  Unfortunately, many in this country don\u2019t care about what happens to people they may never meet",
         "In that case then push for Biden to use that same power to keep that from happening between now and inauguration. \n\n  \nidk if Trump will actually go full dictatorship or not. seems likely knowing what Thiel believes in though. if not Trump then Vance. possibly Trump will actually be taken out to make way for Vance",
         "I really hope you\u2019re overreacting. Hate that it\u2019s even a conversation."

His \"unreliability had those who worked with him pulling out their hair,\" as his confidant Ernst Hanfstaengl later wrote in his memoir Zwischen Wei\u00dfem und Braunem Haus. This meant that rather than carrying out the duties of state, they spent most of their time in-fighting and back-stabbing each other in an attempt to either win his approval or avoid his attention altogether, depending on what mood he was in that day.\n\n>There's a bit of an argument among historians about whether this was a deliberate ploy on Hitler's part to get his own way, or whether he was just really, really bad at being in charge of stuff. Dietrich himself came down on the side of it being a cunning tactic to sow division and chaos\u2014and it's undeniable that he was very effective at that. But when you look at Hitler's personal habits, it's hard to shake the feeling that it was just a natural result of putting a workshy narcissist in charge of a country.\n\n>**Hitler was incredibly lazy. According to his aide Fritz Wiedemann, even when he was in Berlin he wouldn't get out of bed until after 11 a.m., and wouldn't do much before lunch other than read what the newspapers had to say about him, the press cuttings being dutifully delivered to him by Dietrich.**\n\n>He was obsessed with the media and celebrity, and often seems to have viewed himself through that lens. He once described himself as \"the greatest actor in Europe,\" and wrote to a friend, \"I believe my life is the greatest novel in world history.\" In many of his personal habits he came across as strange or even childish\u2014he would have regular naps during the day, he would bite his fingernails at the dinner table, and he had a remarkably sweet tooth that led him to eat \"prodigious amounts of cake\" and \"put so many lumps of sugar in his cup that there was hardly any room for the tea.\"\n\n>He was deeply insecure about his own lack of knowledge, preferring to either ignore information that contradicted his preconceptions, or to lash out at the expertise of others. He hated being laughed at, but enjoyed it when other people were the butt of the joke (he would perform mocking impressions of people he disliked). But he also craved the approval of those he disdained, and his mood would quickly improve if a newspaper wrote something complimentary about him.\n\n>Little of this was especially secret or unknown at the time. It's why so many people failed to take Hitler seriously until it was too late, dismissing him as merely a \"half-mad rascal\" or a \"man with a beery vocal organ.\" In a sense, they weren't wrong. In another, much more important sense, they were as wrong as it's possible to get.\n\n>Hitler's personal failings didn't stop him having an uncanny instinct for political rhetoric that would gain mass appeal, and it turns out you don't actually need to have a particularly competent or functional government to do terrible things.",

This is specifically to prevent pump and dumps like the above commenters believe to be happening. Which from my investment experience, big wigs like directors and CEOs typically make big insider sales for tax purposes, not because they are getting out or the company is tanking. \n\nContextually speaking, to add some validity to my case, you can actually check on [Fintel](https://fintel.io/ss/us/djt) to see the short interest for Trumps stock. Over an hour ago maybe around the time of the article, there were 0 shares available to short. What that means is, institutions borrowed every single share that was available to be borrowed, and sold them, because their outlook is that trump will lose the election resulting in his stock price crashing. So when they buy back the shares at a much lower price than when they sold, they pay what is owe and collect the difference. \n\nThere is absolutely no fucking way in ANY parallel that trump is stupid enough to try and sell his shares the day of the election. He would have had to at the *LATEST*, inform the SEC on Friday, that he would be dumping shares today. Imagine if he fucking did that lmao.\n\n\nEdit: If you already knew all this I apologize and did not mean to insult you.",

         "And you continue to miss the point.",
         "Actually the big players are having their short position completely destroyed as we speak. DJT is currently up 38% (was 41% 5 mins ago) and he appears to be in a pretty decent lead. With Elon next to him, infamous in the investment world for price manipulation, the big wigs should definitely have known better than to try and bet against them. \n\nBack to your initial question, as Trump is not currently holding a position in office, but is a majority share holder of DJT, he is legally required to inform the SEC before making a big sale. This is the key distinct difference between the two. Scumbags like Pelosi can sell or trade and are not required to notify beforehand *unless* they are a majority shareholder. Meaning they own 10%+ of the company via shares. I believe because of the STOCK Act or some shit, Gov officials have up to like 40-50ish days to disclose their financial transactions. \n\nI imagine most Congressman would never pass that threshold cuz it would interfere with their insider dealings. Hell Nancy Pelosi has come really fucking close herself even recently. Offloading idk how many thousands of shares of VISA like 2 weeks before a DOJ probe hits and it shits itself. \n\nNow, having said that. If Trump *does* win, he is not allowed to manage his own investments including such things as DJT. It\u2019s a conflict of interest and typically they are given over to a blind trust where somebody else manages the account for them; and in a lot of cases the person managing the account does not know who it actually belongs to, and vice versa. The person in charge of the President\u2019s investments are unknown to almost everyone as well. I actually find it pretty fucking interesting tbh lol.",

         "I understand the point perfectly. OP said it's probably not him dumping his shares but rather other entities. This would be true of anyone who might be concerned about consequences but it's clear that Trump does not care about consequences as he has escaped any real consequences up to this point in time. Please explain why he would care about the SEC or anyone knowing at all given the current situation.",
         "Billionaires love this one simple trick",
         "Because, if he filed with the SEC to announce he would be selling shares of DJT, the latest he could announce it would be Friday. Of last week. Now idk about your background as mine isn\u2019t in politics, but to *me* it seems pretty no brainer to not announce to your shareholders and people that will be voting for you in the election, that you are in fact rug pulling them, *before* they vote. The possibility of them not being happy with that and changing their vote would be too high of a risk for him to take. Especially over some measly shares that were barely a percentage of his net worth 2 weeks ago. \n\nWhile normally I would agree with your sentiment of him not caring about the ramifications of his actions, in this specific instance it is entirely in his best interest to in fact give a fuck about ramifications of possible bad faith dealings.",

         "I want to share a story about Jon Tester, and part of the reason I've voted for him for over a decade.\n\nWhen I got out of the Marines, I went to UM on the GI Bill.\n\nThe money didn't come for tuition/stipends etc. I was a young former E-4, newly married. We were barely covering expenses and borrowing money from family. I considered dropping out.\n\nAs late October approached, I was getting desperate. My wife was pregnant and we were scraping by. The VA was not helpful at all. I'd wait for 3-4 hours on hold just to be dropped or be told their hands were tied. The campus VA was sympathetic but couldn't do anything, either.\n\nI ended up emailing all my local/state representatives and Senators.  One of them, the only one to respond, forwarded the message to Tester's office.\n\nOne day later, I was in Tester's Missoula office with *his chief of staff* in the closing days of an election year.\n\nShe took down all my info, thanked me for my service, and Tester had a congressional inquiry filed that afternoon.\n\nThat was a Friday--I had my money on Monday. \n\n\nThis is just an anecdote, and it seems small, but this guy's team sat down with a random 22 year old kid in the heat of an election and solved my issue with compassion and quick action. Right through all the red tape.\n\nI'll never forget that of all the people I asked for help, it was a local Democrat and Senator Tester's office *alone* who reached out and helped me.",

However, I did think after we'd seen an attempted coup, that women started losing right, after Trump flat-out declared that he was going to go after his enemies, after EVERYTHING that we've seen over the last eight years, that the majority of us represented in the electoral college would say that we've had enough of this.\n\nI just don't even know what to say now.  I don't even recognize the country anymore.  I feel like everything after 9/11 happened has just been upping the crazy every year besides the relative calm of the Obama presidency.  \n\nHopefully I'm wrong about how far this new government will take things, but I don't think people realize how close we are to an authoritarian government that we will never be able to step away from without a civil war.

God provided for them with food, warmth and all their needs were met. God spoke to the people living next to the mountain. God came down to them and spoke to them. I saw this person who was like a man, but wasn\u2019t human. In the dream I knew he was from God. \n\nNot meant to be written down. As a causal conversation between friends. God spoke. \n\nHe said that trump or trumps will destroy the economy before God comes. I saw an (S) at the end of the word Trump. The word was Trumps.\n\nDream president Biden April 2022\nPresident Biden was talking to higher people in the government. He gave them a chance to leave the government and never come back. If they don\u2019t he will prosecute them because of the wrong they\u2019ve done on Jan 6.\n\n1 person left and another followed him then more joined them as bieden was speaking. Saying don\u2019t you ever show up in any government event or run for office ever again. \n\nAfter everyone left. One government official gathered everyone civilian and took them back to the government building. He was scheming and said that when trump comes back they will take over. I was there as a police officer and didn\u2019t like how he was talking. He then huddled and made everyone join hands. Some of us just left.",

I don't want people in camps.\n\nIf we come to find out that Latino people were a key part of Trump's victory there will naturally be a desire to tell them they fucked around and are going to find out.\n\nBut if our response to people being mass deported is to shrug then the fascists win. To the extent it turns out to be true that Latino people voted against their own interests we should forgive them and show concern for their well-being.  \n\nIf the worst case comes to pass and Latino communities are getting ripped apart and people are being crowded into camps and sent to countries they haven't been in or over a decade they will already be punished. \n\nWe need to recommit to our principles and use this as an opportunity to demonstrate the importance of those principles. \n\nWhen people are suffering and atrocities are being committed we will be there working to fight and resist it and we will earn the commitment that has been lost.",

If you're a white Hispanic, they just won't consider you white. Even if they do, it doesn't mean you'll be treated equally. White nationalists simultaneously believe race is an objective biological thing that exists *and* that if you have blonde hair and blue eyes but your last name is Rodriguez or Goldstein then you're not actually white. Racists themselves are the biggest proof that race is a social construct and not something biological.\n\n>What really drives me nuts about this is conservative Catholics who don't realize that if Christian Nationalists ever win, they are all in serious danger.\n\nMainstream Christian nationalism in the U.S. tends to be somewhat inclusive of Catholics. After all, many of the prominent figures - Kevin Roberts, JD Vance, Nick Fuentes, John McEntee, etc. - are Catholic. Heck, Peter Thiel and Elon Musks are atheists and part of that movement. \n\nBut it's a temporary and convenient alliance: if they get power, they're gonna set their sights on Catholics, Mormons, Orthodox, any liberal Protestant churches, etc. Latinos are often stuck in a Catholic bubble (language barrier doesn't help) and often don't know that a lot of Evangelical Protestants really hate Catholics.",

Those fucks hate the Quebecois for being Catholic and French-speaking, you think they're gonna accept Orthodox Christians who speak a Slavic language and use a different alphabet?

         "I think a lot of white folks in the U.S. define \"white\" in their head as people who look vaguely Nordic (so basically northern and eastern Europeans). If you look vaguely Mediterranean, they just don't consider you white, even if you're pale. I'm not pale but I'm not tan either, but my hair and eyes are dark brown, I can grow a prickly dense beard, I have a hairy body, and my eyes and nose shape are typical of a Spaniard or Italian (I basically look like a slightly chubby Maluma without tattoos, down to the skin tone and everything).\n\nI work at a retail home improvement store and we don't have uniforms, so we can wear whatever we want (except jewelry when we operate machines). On days where I dress like a \"white\" person (black tee and beige cargos), the Latino customers either ask me questions first in English because they think I'm not Latino, or ask me if I know Spanish because they have a hunch I might be one but they're not sure. If they don't know English, they ask for a translator, and that's when I surprise them with Spanish.\n\nOn days where I dress more stereotypically Latino (baggy blue jeans, white Nike basketball shoes, earrings, thin gold chain and a watch), like 95% of the time the Latino customers immediately ask me questions in Spanish. They just know. In recent years I've been dressing more like this basically as a response to MAGA (I also just like the style) and to signal to other Latinos that I'm one of them and that they can talk to me in Spanish.\n\nI'll tell you this: when I was in K-12, I never perceived myself as being the same race as the blonde/ginger white kids. After all, those kids insisted I wasn't white, and Latinos themselves use \"blanco\" to mean northern Europeans when talking in an American context (in a Latin American context, I would be considered *blanco* by other Latinos, but I suddenly become *not* white when in an American context). So I didn't perceive myself as white because all the cultural messaging I was getting was telling me I wasn't. I perceived myself as Hispanic and nothing else.
