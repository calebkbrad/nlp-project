         "Its mind blowing how artists can instantly become villains with the far right simply for telling people to vote",
         "That\u2019s how it\u2019s done done",
         "Hell yeah, Sabrina. And Charli xcx jump-started Kamala's social presence with a single tweet. The pop girlies are helping to bring this one home.",
         "Hot as fuck, smart as fuck.",
         "Well done, Sabrina, and well fucking done, Brownie. 20 years of Headcount and still gaining steam.",
         "She worked late. Cuz she's a singer.",
         "I... have never heard of her. Getting older SUCKS. I'm no longer WITH IT.",
         "I was SO EXCITED to vote this election! I was on parole in 2020 and it killed me that I couldn't vote against Trump again. This is only the second time I've ever voted FOR someone instead of simply opposing someone but the fact that it still opposes trump was reason enough. \n\nI kept my little sticker for my personal scrapbook I started as a kid. I can't wait to add in the memory of voting for the first woman president.",
         "Move over, Taylor. There\u2019s another blond, white woman registering voters up in this jawn.",

This year alone, HeadCount has participated in over 3,700 events, registered over 450,000 new voters, and engaged over 3,000,000 music fans to take action, according to a press release issued by the nonprofit. More than 80% of all voters HeadCount has registered this year are Gen Z or Millennials.\n\nPretty rad. Yes, I am an old.",
         "I bet me and Sabrina Carpenter have really good bad chem.",
         "That\u2019s good but once we see the numbers behind the massive Kamala landslide, it won\u2019t even matter. This election has been decided for months! \n\n\ud83d\udc99\ud83c\udf0a",

         "She\u2019s a real one! Just like Dolly, I\u2019m not in to their music but I can appreciate good people in the world. I\u2019ll stream her overnight or something to give back a little something",

         "No idea who she is, but great job anyhow!",
         "I only knew her from Girl Meets World. She was a good friend.",
         "It boggles my mind that a first world super power, can\u2019t just automatically register its citizens to vote. I get a pamphlet in the mail that tells me what time, where and when to vote. I show up, show my ID, go in and vote in pen and paper. And back home I go, how or why does the US not do this?",
         "Nice",
         "I may not like her music, but this is amazing!",
         "She's a great singer - I attended one of her concerts this summer - and now I learn she also has great politics.",
         "She\u2019s from Pennsylvania too. Anything helps",

(I'm a bot)\n*****\n> Sabrina Carpenter has engaged more voters through HeadCount than any other artist in 2024, registering over 27,000 new voters and engaging over 183,000 voters through giveaways, in-person activations and video boards on her &quot;Short n&#039; Sweet&quot; arena tour.\n\n> Prior to HeadCount joining the tour, they worked with Carpenter to send to two lucky fans to Gov Ball - resulting in over 40,000 fans checking their voter registration overnight.\n\n> &quot;We couldn&#039;t be more excited to continue our partnership with Sabrina! Young voter engagement is more crucial than ever in this election, where the race could come down to a few hundred thousand votes, and there are few people as impactful as Sabrina to spread that message through this sweepstakes and her tour,&quot; said Lucille Wenegieme, CEO of HeadCount, at the time.\n\n\n*****\n[**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/1gkfxij/sabrina_carpenter_registered_27000_voters_on_tour/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ \"Version 2.02, ~696138 tl;drs so far.\") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr \"PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome.\") | *Top* *keywords*: **voter**^#1 **over**^#2 **tour**^#3 **HeadCount**^#4 **engaged**^#5",

Celebrities who want to be able to fly around in their private jets without getting in trouble for it.\n\nAnd we've already given our politicians way too many reasons to placate the wealthy..\n\nThese votes aren't going to mean shit if there's not a planet to hold the vote on.",

         "This says she got 27k.  So Green Day only got 8k?\n\nI'm disappointed in Green Day.",
         "Taylor Swift helped bring in a surge of 35,000+ new voters right after her endorsement.",
         "I'm primarily a rock guy, but I love this song so much. Plus Chappell Roan's \"Red Wine Supernova.\" Just some great, witty lyrics.",
         "My child loves this song. One time the car, the explicit version played, first I heard. Outwardly I acted shocked, but secretly fell in love with the song.",
         "Please, please....please....",
         "Just don\u2019t ever play the clean version. \n\nLittle suckers is the weakest shit I\u2019ve ever heard\u2026",

         "Espresso is a good, well written song and I will die on that hill. She\u2019s singing about a guy who has a crush on her, and she may or may not like him but she loves the attention. That meaning and vibe is delivered on multiple levels from lyrics, to vocals, to instrumentals. You may or may not love the topic, but she told a little story and she told very well. It\u2019s nice to see she\u2019s smart in so many ways.",
         "Don\u2019t. It\u2019s an ear worm.",
         "listen to \"bed chem\". like I'm not really a pop fan but its actually catchy af haha",

         "Nothing but women when I went to vote this morning, even the women working the polls!",
         "Shamelessly hingeing on a top comment to ask: what does this mean? People who showed up at her concerts voted there? She had election people register voters at her concert? Whathappuned?",

         "I\u2019m an elder GenXer and have never heard of so many of Kamala\u2019s celebrity endorsements. And that\u2019s great because I know they\u2019re reaching so many diverse audiences that I am not a part of or even tangential to. The breadth of their reach is incredible. And it can only help.\n\nBless you, Sabrina Carpenter, whoever you are!  \ud83d\ude42",
         "Z-ennial, and it looks like she's a former Disney star from right *after* my era. For example, she had a lead role in Milo Murphy's Law.",
         "She's a VERY popular pop girlie right now. Not exactly Taylor Swift popular, but all of her singles from this year are some of the most streamed songs of 2024.",
         "I\u2019m a mid-millennial with a 12 year old. She is to today\u2019s youth what Brittany Spears was to us in the early 00s. Disney background, escaping that image, very talented, catchy songs.",
         "How did you possibly escape the vortex that is the song espresso?",
         "She lived near me and I had no idea who she was until about two weeks ago. You\u2019re ok in my book \ud83e\udd17",
         "Elder millennials that ever caught the Boy Meets World reboot Girl Meets World, she was also the best friend of Cory and Topanga\u2019s daughter.",
         "I\u2019m firmly a millennial. Just saw her in SLC. She\u2019s the real deal.",
         "If you ever watched Boy Meets World growing up, she is the main character's bestie in Girl Meets World, the sequel to that show.",
         "listen to good graces!",
         "Why be the \"I don't know who that is\" person? Just pull up youtube or Spotify and educate yourself!",
         "I'm an elder millennial who listens to her new album all the time",
         "Okay, then I feel better. I\u2019m younger GenX, and I\u2019ve never heard of her, but good for her for being civically-minded.",
         "Remember Boy Meets World? She was the Shawn on Girl Meets World with Cory/Topanga's daughter.",
         "If you watched *Boy Meets World* you may have been tempted to watch the sequel series, which she starred in.",
         "She played the Shawn surrogate 'bad girl' character in the Boy Meets World reboot.  Otherwise im with you.",
         "Probably because shes a singer.",
         "Yup. Headcount had a table at every dead and co show I went to. I was at Billy strings Halloween last week, and they were set up there too. Always like seeing them at shows, even if it\u2019s annoying having to tell them I\u2019m already registered every time lol.",
         "Sabrina is B4L kangfirmed",
         "They are awesome to volunteer for. I\u2019ve seen so many huge concerts for free thanks to them.",

         "I think this is specific to the Headcount website\n\nhttps://www.headcount.org/\n\nSwift drove a lot of people to register, but I don't think she did through any specific site?",
         "No one knows how many people taylor encouraged to vote (as she did it through instagram not a tracked), but 405,000 people visited the link to register she posted on her instagram!",
         "yea i thought so too\u00a0",
         "Labeling Kamala \u201cbrat\u201d suddenly made her cool and accesible",
         "Short and Sweet!",
         "She\u2019s working late cuz she\u2019s a singer.  That\u2019s sweet that\u2019s her espresso.[https://youtu.be/eVli-tstM5E?si=593o6wIMokeBqaLZ](https://youtu.be/eVli-tstM5E?si=593o6wIMokeBqaLZ)",
         "I make an effort to listen to what's hot in pop every 6 months ago just to not get too out of touch, but emphasis on \"effort.\" It doesn't come naturally anymore. Without radio being such a force, it's very easy to stay in a bubble of what I already like.",
         "That\u2019s great to hear. I hope it all shakes out ok, it could be a really good day.  \nAussie watching from afar.",
         "I was born in 2005 lmao.",
         "Bed Chem. Even better lol",
         "Lmaoo the typo",
         "Ask youtube for the official video for Please Please Please, and Espresso. She\u2019s funny and hard working. She toured a bit with Taylor Swift as her opening act.",
         "The fact they put her on SNL with Kamala was hilarious. That had to have been an awkward conversation.",
         "Because she\u2019s related to Nancy Cartwright?",
         "Really? Musk is paying --excuse you, BRIBING  people to vote. Versus just getting people registered.",
         "lol the \"undergraduate home on holiday break annoying their relatives\" energy is off the charts on this one",
         "That\u2019s far from a given. If you look at photos of her over the years it\u2019s mostly her makeup that\u2019s changed and she\u2019s clever with her costumes so the boobs could be natural or helped a bit. Even if she has had any surgery it\u2019s pretty minor, and totally just her business.",
         "Real \"Wayne and Brent Gretzky\" energy",
         "Lol good job.\u00a0",
         "Thank you for your service in stopping the Orange Rape Ogre.",
         "Between me, Zandercy42, Sabrina Carpenter, and Green Day we've registered over 35k voters \ud83d\ude4c",
         "Yeah Annie. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of the cause. It\u2019s because of your giant shows.",
         "Proud of you",
         "Take tomorrow off and treat yourself to one of those $8 coconut waters. You been putting in that work!",
         "Proud of you",
         "And Taylor Swift too!",
         "Me and Taylor have more...",
         "I would 100% be into a Sabrina version of that song. I'd be into a cover of Row Row Row Your Boat if she was singing, if I'm honest.",
         "My dad told me that I wasn\u2019t allowed to listen to them as a child because \u201cGreen Day hates George Bush\u201d",
         "She endorsed, but she didn't go anywhere near as far as the others, so maybe lets let someone else get their well deserved spotlight on this one.",
         "Look, I am a fan of Swift as much as most early 30s white women, but she has done the absolute bare minimum this election cycle. Instead of meeting Harris on the trail somewhere the last few weeks, she continued to buddy up to the republic Mahomes family via her boyfriend. \n\nI am glad she endorsed and made her story active with info for a day, but I'm not going to give her special props beyond. Many other celebs are out there actually campaigning (Jennifer Lawrence door-to-door canvased in NV), registering fans across the country (Sabrina Carpenter), actually making repeated social media posts (Mark Ruffalo), or hitting the trail with Kamala (Lady Gaga).",
         "I don't care for any of these artists musically but it's funny how the fans treat them like high school class presidents. Another one of them is in the news and the fans of the other one come swarming in lol.",
         "She posted an endorsement on IG and posted links to register to vote on her IG story. About 400k people clicked the link, but there were no numbers on how many people she got to actually register to vote. She also sandwiched a little reminder to vote in her latest Eras post.\n\nI was thinking she would do more after watching her Miss Americana documentary, but am not shocked that she didn't. She cares too much about losing fans to do anything more than just one half-assed endorsement on IG.\n\nI'm not saying she *has* to endorse anyone or share her political opinions. Nobody does. But I think people who watched her documentary definitely expected more from her.",
         "Good on her, but honestly, she just wrote something.",
         "Yeah the article says Green Day got 8k.\n\nGreen Day got 8,000 more people registered than 99.99% of the other artists, I don't know why you are disappointed.\n\nEvery vote counts!!",
         "> HeadCount also confirmed Green Day\u2019s \u201cSaviors Tour\u201d broke their all-time record for most voters engaged for a single tour, registering over 7,900 new voters and engaging over 61,000 voters through in-person activations on tour. This nearly doubles the previous record set by Ariana Grande\u2019s 2019 \u201cSweetener World Tour.\u201d\n\nGreen Day also broke records according to the article.\n\nTheir tour also ended right before September ended so they managed to do this without before even reaching peak campaign/registration season too.",
         "Good for her?\n\nI didn't know it was a contest. I didn't say anything about Taylor Swift. Aren't the two of them good friends? It doesn't surprise me that they'd both do their part.",
         "Carpenter and Roan produce bops. I exist primarily in a pop punk post hardcore with hints of power metal place but love a good pop song. Espresso and Pink pony club are stuck in my head. Life is a buffet, take it all.",
         "This era of female written lyrics has been \ud83d\udd25",
         "\"When you wake up next to him in the middle of the night with your head in your hands being nothing more than his wife.\n\nAnd when you think about me all of those years ago. You're standing face to face with 'I told you so'.\n\nYou know I hate to say it 'I told you so'. You know I hate to say it but 'I TOLD YOU SO.'\"\n\nLyrics of the 2020s tbqh.",
         "Yes! Love both songs/artists.\n\nAlso - no chance I'll embarass her. Already voted Harris/Walz Saturday.\n\nLet's just keep the momentum going. It's encouraging to see early voter turnout as is.",
         "These two were the soundtrack of my summer for real. So many bangers put out by both.",
         "Same dude, I have been blasting Chappell Roan\u2019s album.",
         "I just heard her music for the first time last night (\"Coincidence\") and was blown away. As an aging classic rock Canadian, real boss Joni Mitchell vibes there.",
         "I used to be primarily a rock guy but I realized at some point in my twenties I like music that makes me feel good. turns out that comes in just about every flavor, and that includes lots of girly pop. those two chicks are killing it right now.",
         "I heard you like magic    \nI\u2019ve got a wand and a rabbit",
         "Oh so you're the reason the new rule got put up in her sub lol",
         "I\u2019m a dad who\u2019d only heard the clean version until a couple weeks ago. Now the explicit version is my commute jam.",

         "I feel like the bare minimum would have been saying nothing, like most people.

         "From NPR:\n\n> When Taylor Swift speaks, her fans listen. On Tuesday morning, the singer posted a short message on Instagram encouraging her 272 million followers to register to vote. Afterward, the website she directed her fans to \u2014 the nonpartisan nonprofit Vote.org \u2014 recorded more than 35,000 registrations, according to the organization. \n\nIt goes on to state that the number of people who REGISTERED to vote was 35,252. I'm not even a Swiftie, this is just being able to read.",
         "Agreed, t swift did the bare minimum after she was essentially forced to by the Trump campaign. Remember that? That whole thing only happened 3 weeks ago lol. \n\nOther than making some \u201cbravely candid\u201d recorded statements about \u201cnot caring if she gets negative pr for not supporting Trump\u201d and generating clicks from an Instagram story, is not the same as pushing 30,000+ people to actually register to vote.",
         "It says in the 2nd article that they linked. \"During National Voting Day on Tuesday (Sept. 19), the pop superstar shared a message on Instagram urging her 272 million followers to register to vote through nonpartisan nonprofit Vote.org.

         "But I don't think it's the same comparison at all.\n\nWayne alone had records that beat entire families that had successful careers, so adding Brent was always funny.\n\nLeBron's definitely GOAT territory, that's not a dispute. But no one has dominated a league in any sport like Wayne did.",

         "I do agree, yes.\n\n\nBut Sabrina's been signing people up at her shows, which obviously hasn't really been an option for Tayler since most of her shows this year have been overseas.\n\n\nTaylor has been posting on her socials to get people to register and vote (today too!), and apparently 400,000+ people clicked the registration link she posted - but it wasn't through headcount, so you can't track how many of those signed up. So I think she's done quite a bit.\n\n\n\n\nIf she'd been mostly touring stateside this year I would have expected her to do more, of course, but encouraging Brits to register for the US elections wouldn't do too much.",
         "I\u2019m going to give a different perspective\u2026 Celebrities are, for the most part, globally-known. Right now, Taylor Swift is the most famous person in the world. She endorsed Harris on social media. To keep herself and her fans safe, that\u2019s the extent to which she needed to push this year. If she\u2019d gone full blown support, that opens her up to violence. She had to cancel all Vienna dates due to a terror plot. With her last US dates concluding this past Sunday, so close to the election, her concerts would\u2019ve been a target. After the Ariana Grande attack, she\u2019s openly stated safety at her events is a high priority. \n\nShe\u2019s been more vocal during previous elections. She\u2019s also generated large voter reg numbers. Exactly what else does she, or any other celebrity, need to do? Further, no one is obligated to give their political opinions publicly. No one. We need to stop demanding celebrities do so.",
         "Well that is cool.",
         "Just like when it comes to taxes, billionaires owe us more than the bare minimum. Swift did more than nothing, and she did face backlash. But like c'mon, she's a billionaire.",
         "Naughty! I love it.",
         "OH",
         "Oh!",
         "Makes so much more sense now",
         "Haha, everyone in the video looks like a child to me (mid 30's) I just thought those dudes stood out as looking even younger, but that makes sense.",
         "Yeah, that\u2019s just a different opinion. And one of the reasons I don\u2019t think too much of her as a celebrity. But if you like her and her music speaks to you, that\u2019s awesome, we can all use more joy in life!",
         "Yeah, it's nice that celebrities can give their input. But, ultimately we should not require a famous person in order to exercise our ONLY legal power to actually change shit for ourselves in this nation.\n\n For now, we have this unfortunately."

So it is practically guaranteed that they are moving the outcomes closer to 50/50 than what they observe.

If we stopped doing things that they could historically take credit for being successful, and instead did other things that ended up not appearing successful, it would hurt their career.

Are you the biggest loser, Donald? I talked to all the historians at the Wharton School and at MIT and they\u2019ve never seen anything like it. No one has ever tried to steal three elections in a row. At least George W. Bush was able to actually win one. \n\nDonald, are you a bigger loser than George W. Bush?\n\nYou lost your first election by three million votes. Americans don\u2019t like you, Donald. \n\nThen you lost your second election by 10 million votes. You always say you got more votes than any sitting president ever, and yet\u2026 you still lost by 10 million votes. That\u2019s how much people don\u2019t like you.\n\nDonald, you can do math can\u2019t you? In 2020, seven million people liked Joe Biden more than you! Another 3 million, given the choice between Biden and You, chose ANYONE ELSE. That\u2019s 84 million Americans, Donald, who voted against you. 84 Million! No sitting President has ever had that many people vote against him, Donald. No one.\n\nJust you. \n\nLet me put it another way for you, Don. In 2016, there were 65 million people who voted against you. Four years later, it was 84 million people! That\u2019s 19 million more people the second time! They weren\u2019t illegal, Donald. They weren\u2019t \u201cmade up\u201d votes. It wasn\u2019t \u201cvoter fraud.\u201d It was non-voters!

So, I\u2019m guessing that the outcome is going to be way off from what most of the polling was telling us about his supporters.

There were going to be mass executions and everything. Then the inauguration happened and there was no mass arrest and Biden was sworn in as president. So the date was moved further into the future and soon Trump would reveal himself as the real president. But that date came and went as well. And another date. And another one. There were predictions about all of the various court cases contesting the election results, and all of them fell flat. People were finally starting to get tired of the constant stream of predictions being wrong and it was getting harder and harder for them to just say \"Trust the plan\" when literally nothing was going their way. I think the final nail in the coffin was when Q jumped the shark and predicted JFK Jr was going to come back from the dead and reveal himself as a Trump supporter and Trump's new Vice President. Most of the remaining Q supporters gave up at this point, and the few who didn't were thoroughly mocked by the media when they actually showed up in Dallas waiting for the big reveal.\n\nI honestly don't know if Q kept making predictions after this point because that was effectively the end of anyone caring or talking about it.

We were barely covering expenses and borrowing money from family. I considered dropping out.\n\nAs late October approached, I was getting desperate. My wife was pregnant and we were scraping by. The VA was not helpful at all. I'd wait for 3-4 hours on hold just to be dropped or be told their hands were tied. The campus VA was sympathetic but couldn't do anything, either.\n\nI ended up emailing all my local/state representatives and Senators.  One of them, the only one to respond, forwarded the message to Tester's office.\n\nOne day later, I was in Tester's Missoula office with *his chief of staff* in the closing days of an election year.\n\nShe took down all my info, thanked me for my service, and Tester had a congressional inquiry filed that afternoon.\n\nThat was a Friday--I had my money on Monday. \n\n\nThis is just an anecdote, and it seems small, but this guy's team sat down with a random 22 year old kid in the heat of an election and solved my issue with compassion and quick action. Right through all the red tape.\n\nI'll never forget that of all the people I asked for help, it was a local Democrat and Senator Tester's office *alone* who reached out and helped me.",

         "I know we're in a crazy period of politics but let's try to look at this objectively, setting aside Trump's laundry list of scandals and misbehavior any one of which would have ended someone else's political career.\n\nTrump is at best one inch deep on every single policy issue and can't be bothered to learn or communicate facts about any actual governance and policy. He has run 3 very unorthodox campaigns, completely avoiding traditional media and relying on social media, and appears to do everything he can to alienate voting segments besides his core white male supporters. He insults women, blacks, Latinos, immigrants, and veterans at every turn and you can't win an election without some of these voting blocks.\n\nSince 2019 Trump's entire campaign apparatus was geared heavily and exclusively towards beating Biden. Millions of dollars and thousands of people were focused exclusively on that goal. When Biden dropped out and Harris declared her run, it took the Trump campaign months to respond and it never really did much, they were caught completely flat-footed, and Harris dominated the news cycle for weeks.\n\nMeanwhile numerous Republicans and former supporters spoke out against him -- most of his former cabinet, The Mooch, Dick Cheney, etc. even Mitch McConnell had some criticisms. There's \"Republicans for Harris\" but there is no \"Democrats for Trump\".\n\nIn the crucial last 6 weeks of the campaign, Trump bailed on about 95% of his media appearances and when he did appear, he said all kinds of random things about real and fake celebrities. He let Harris control the media narrative uncontested, the best he had was some warmed-over TV and YouTube ads.\n\nHarris raised 10 times as much money as Hillary, over $1 billion, which is mind boggling and has spent her entire time blitzing swing, undecided and new voters.\n\nIf Harris ends up winning I think it will be pretty clear why.",

They are a bunch of cowards that are terrified of their own base, as they\u2019ve proven over and over again since 2016.\n\nIf they had any fucking shame or morals, they would have cast him aside after the shit he said about gold star families and John McCain.

To Cruz' defense, he's very used to that.\n\nOnce that failed, and Trump remained, they FOR SOME REASON, let DeSantis run against him. I have no idea why DeSantis did this, clearly Trump was the front runner, there's no way he wasn't taking the primaries, and DeSantis was supposedly their 'ace in the hole' and not just did he lose to Trump, he looked like an absolute buffoon while doing it.\n\nVance is clearly their next pick, but the man has the charisma of a rusty spoon and can't not say weird dumb shit, so I don't see him lasting either.",

I think it\u2019d take a dominant Harris win to really force the pivot away from it entirely, and I can\u2019t deny that even if that were to happen there will always be a bit of a Trump presence left within the party.\n\nHowever, even if we see another close race, the GOP stuck with Trump because it kept looking like he was their best chance to win. If he loses 2 elections that looked very winnable, one of which with the unprecedented note of losing to a candidate that replaced an incumbent president mid election, there\u2019d have to at least be some reflection at the top level of the party about whether or not this strategy is sustainable especially with possible factors like Trump falling further behind with the popular vote and likely just being too old to run himself. Can it even work without Trump, because the GOP primaries seem to say otherwise this year. It\u2019s why I\u2019ve always thought they\u2019d run into real problems anyway when Trump was gone.\n\nMaybe they ultimately do settle on tyring Trump without Trump but I\u2019d still expect discussions second guessing it before the decision is made.",

He procrastinated wildly when asked to make difficult decisions, and would often end up relying on gut feeling, leaving even close allies in the dark about his plans. His \"unreliability had those who worked with him pulling out their hair,\" as his confidant Ernst Hanfstaengl later wrote in his memoir Zwischen Wei\u00dfem und Braunem Haus. This meant that rather than carrying out the duties of state, they spent most of their time in-fighting and back-stabbing each other in an attempt to either win his approval or avoid his attention altogether, depending on what mood he was in that day.\n\n>There's a bit of an argument among historians about whether this was a deliberate ploy on Hitler's part to get his own way, or whether he was just really, really bad at being in charge of stuff. Dietrich himself came down on the side of it being a cunning tactic to sow division and chaos\u2014and it's undeniable that he was very effective at that. But when you look at Hitler's personal habits, it's hard to shake the feeling that it was just a natural result of putting a workshy narcissist in charge of a country.\n\n>**Hitler was incredibly lazy. According to his aide Fritz Wiedemann, even when he was in Berlin he wouldn't get out of bed until after 11 a.m., and wouldn't do much before lunch other than read what the newspapers had to say about him, the press cuttings being dutifully delivered to him by Dietrich.**\n\n>He was obsessed with the media and celebrity, and often seems to have viewed himself through that lens. He once described himself as \"the greatest actor in Europe,\" and wrote to a friend, \"I believe my life is the greatest novel in world history.\" In many of his personal habits he came across as strange or even childish\u2014he would have regular naps during the day, he would bite his fingernails at the dinner table, and he had a remarkably sweet tooth that led him to eat \"prodigious amounts of cake\" and \"put so many lumps of sugar in his cup that there was hardly any room for the tea.\"\n\n>He was deeply insecure about his own lack of knowledge, preferring to either ignore information that contradicted his preconceptions, or to lash out at the expertise of others. He hated being laughed at, but enjoyed it when other people were the butt of the joke (he would perform mocking impressions of people he disliked). But he also craved the approval of those he disdained, and his mood would quickly improve if a newspaper wrote something complimentary about him.\n\n>Little of this was especially secret or unknown at the time. It's why so many people failed to take Hitler seriously until it was too late, dismissing him as merely a \"half-mad rascal\" or a \"man with a beery vocal organ.\" In a sense, they weren't wrong. In another, much more important sense, they were as wrong as it's possible to get.\n\n>Hitler's personal failings didn't stop him having an uncanny instinct for political rhetoric that would gain mass appeal, and it turns out you don't actually need to have a particularly competent or functional government to do terrible things.",

We were married and wanted to have a child and all that. But something beyond our control went wrong. \n\nI am not saying all this to say that our situation is more valid than someone with an accidental pregnancy, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anyone\u2019s business but the patient and doctor.

         "I had one of the most heated conversation last night I've ever had with my dad. I never really considered my dad a Trumper. He had a sign in 2016, but he toned down his political rhetoric after 2018 (coincidentally when he ran for a local office and was soundly defeated by someone using Trump's playbook on him).\n\nWe covered a lot of issues, but the one that really showed how futile it was was when we talked about the economy. My dad tried to say how the economy would do better under Trump and I pointed out that 26 Nobel laureates back Harris, none back Trump. He then said to me \"well why does my finance guy tell me Trump will be better for the economy?\" I told him to look back at the communications from 2020 because I'll bet that same finance guy said Biden would destroy the economy, yet the market gains have outpaced Trump. On top of that, he's been contemplating firing this finance guy for the last 3 years, but now all of a sudden we're just going to trust him blindly?\n\nBut even after all that, he was still steadfast on Trump and I just gave up. There wasn't a single issue he was able to hold a position on over the course of our 2 hour conversation. And it was honestly the best I've ever been able to speak on politics. Yet it left me so utterly disappointed.",

         "The irony about Mars, and all of Elon's fanboys thinking in their lifetimes they might be able to go live on some Martian colony (while having Elon's chips in their brains, despite many being anti-vax, lol) is that it'd be a nightmare:\n\nLiterally every movie, even the more critically acclaimed, \"The Martian\" (with Matt Damon) don't depict the fact that Mars only has *a bit under 1/3rd of Earth's gravity*, so in all those movies, people should be doing the goofy bouncy walking more similar to the astronauts we had on the Moon (but a little less extreme).\n\nOn top of that: radiation levels on the surface are *over a thousand times that on Earth*, and without terraforming the entire thing, which we're centuries, if not millenia away from technologically.\n\nFinally: the temperature owing to its at most very thin atmosphere, is *at best* 70 degrees F during the day time at the equator, which while impressive it gets that warm, that far from the sun, *it drops down to -100+ F at night,* like a very extreme Earth desert, and it only gets worse the further from the equator you get.\n\nSo yeah, I don't doubt we might have a permanent small observatory, or a few, decades from now on Mars, similar to Antarctica now - but unless people would want to live years deep underground without natural light, bouncing around in low gravity, risking atrophy, etc., where low gravity likely makes human pregnancies impossible: living on Mars would be a total nightmare, lol.",

Putin will have him ghost post statements/tweets/whatever for decades. When AI generation gets good enough to realistically show on live TV they'll do that, too.",

Then there's the women who have been assaulted, and no \"women's bodies don't have a way of dealing with it if it is legitimate rape\".  There are exceptions in some of the laws, but given that so many women don't even report rape, especially by a family member, how the hell much good is that going to do. And as we've seen multiple times in Texas and other restrictive states doctors won't even follow the law that says they can proceed if it is a risk for the mother over fear of legal repercussions.  So it's all just a giant screw you to women.",

He's always been more interested in ratings than in policymaking. Popularity and attention are the only things that matter to him.",
         "Polls have a habit of moving around wildly and every poll shows something slightly different. With a reported margin of error of 3.3%, that 7% shift could conceivably be a 0.4% shift, which is basically nothing\n\nThat same caveat applies to Harris's gain as well",
         "I feel an obligation not to impose myself on others, whether I personally agree with them, understand them, or even know anyone pertaining to the group being affected. It's really that simple for me.\n\nA woman's decision over her body? Not my place to have a voice. An adult's decision to marry another consenting adult? Not my place to have a voice. What someone wants to do to their own body to feel more comfortable with themselves? Not my place to have a voice.\n\nAnd you know what? It makes my life a hell of a lot easier. I'm already overwhelmed by life, the last thing I need is more bullshit to deal with.",

         "I hate that it works this way, but no judge wants the optics of being the first to jail a former president and current presidential nominee for a major party right before the election. Most *legitimate* judges are going to bend over backwards to avoid appearing even the slightest bit political and let\u2019s face it there\u2019s no way to jail Trump right now without it looking political. They were always going to punt until after the election.",
         "Unfortunately, the USSS isn't exactly a beacon of protecting democracy at the moment.",

Agree or disagree with him, Obama is clearly very intelligent, a caring father, and more athletic to top it all off. It was and is undeniable. \n\nThey\u2019ve since become better at lying to themselves and are able to still feel superior to Harris, if only because she\u2019s a woman.",

         "If Eugene Debs could run from prison, then so can Donald Trump.",
         "Merchan didn't do that though. However he rationalizes it, he lent Trump a hand by repeatedly delaying his sentencing. The delays in sentencing were 100% political and work to Trump's benefit.\n\nI agree with Judge Chutkan that the only way to treat Trump without being political is to treat him exactly the same as any other defendant would be treated. If Merchan had done that, Trump would have already been sentenced--though not necessarily to jail.\n\nA typical white-collar defendant in a case like Trump's--old, no criminal record--would be likely to receive probation in NY. Trump himself is more of a wild card, because of all the crimes he's obviously committed, yet hasn't been proven guilty of in court. But by the same token, a typical defendant in Trump's situation would not be entitled to multiple adjournments of his sentencing. Maybe one, due to the appellate issue created by the US Supreme Court this past summer. But he should have been sentenced long ago despite that.\n\nAll that being said...if Merchan delayed his sentencing in order to watch how he conducts himself while free during the election...he may end up with a much more solid foundation to sentence Trump to prison. Merchan hasn't made any sort of promise, and can give Trump the max if he determines that Trump deserves it.",
         "Thays why secret service stays with you forever. You're always a political target after presidency, you simply know too much and have had too much impact.",

There have been isolated instances of mischief, but the number is tiny and there has never been anything substantial enough to affect even the furthest down ballot small town race.\n\nDuring the pandemic, Donald Trump famously said that if America shifts to Vote By Mail no Republican will ever get elected again.

If you want to vote early in PA, you show up, request a mail-in ballot, application is processed, you wait, and they give you a mail-in ballot to fill out. There is no conspiracy here. There is no cheating going on. There are long wait times because, after Republican voters were told that mail-in voting was cheating in 2020, it is now magically secure since DJT says so. These people don\u2019t understand how the process works, so they assume foul play is occurring.

Georgia we won\u2019t see done until tomorrow mid day at the earliest, North Carolina we should expect up to 10 days until they are finished, thanks largely in part to the recent hurricanes, Wisconsin can\u2019t start counting absentee ballots until today, so will likely not get final numbers until tomorrow at the earliest, in California the deadline is December 5th, but we can almost guarantee Harris will be called the winner for Cali the night of, and it\u2019s rare to see them take any longer than a week or two. \n\nWe will have a decent idea before midnight, but a definitive answer is unlikely unless it ends up being a complete blowout\u2026 like Harris finishing with 336 and Trump 196\u2026",

But your comment I replied to literally said \u201cI don\u2019t think ANY are willing to turn around and go home.\u201d Which is just false.\n\nCan we not recognize that high voter turnout is good, while still pointing of the flaws that it exposes in our current voting system? Because it is also NOT good that some people, even if it\u2019s a small amount, are not going to vote because they don\u2019t think they have time to stand in line for hours. Why isn\u2019t it easier to vote in every state? Why doesn\u2019t PA allow in person early voting like many other states? In my state, for a full two weeks before Election Day, you can show up and vote from 7 am to 7 pm, 7 days a week. You have 12 hour windows for 14 days straight to find a time when you can vote. I was in and out in less than 10 minutes last Friday night. \n\nWe can use the issues shown in current election procedures in order to demand better in the future.",

         "\"I think he's a brilliant businessman, and I think he knows how to use the media and manipulate it to his advantage... He is the consummate showman.

He\u2019s a good promoter. He\u2019s got a sense of how to sell himself. I respect that.\" \n~Robert DeNiro (2011 interview from The Hollywood Reporter)\n\nBy 2018:\n\"Fk Trump! It\u2019s no longer 'Down with Trump.' It\u2019s 'Fk Trump!'\"\n\nWhat happened? \n\nCancel culture gained momentum in 2016 and the #MeToo movement gained steam by 2017 as well as woke culture. \n\nSo pre-2016 Perlman was largely singing his praise as was DeNiro, but by the time cancel culture took off, their rhetoric shifted to align with all the other individuals trying to keep cancel culture off their back. \n\nBefore 2016 Trump was a well-regarded and well-respected business mogul. \n\nWhat happened?\n\nWeinstein happened. \n\nIn October 2016, just before the presidential election, a bombshell story about Harvey Weinstein\u2019s long history of alleged sexual harassment was published by The New York Times. The article detailed years of allegations from women about Weinstein\u2019s inappropriate behavior, which ranged from harassment to assaults.\n\nTrump's remarks:\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve known him for a long time. I\u2019m not surprised to hear it. \u2026 I\u2019ve known him for a long time. I\u2019m not a fan of Harvey Weinstein, and I\u2019ve been saying that for a long time. I was never a fan of his, I can tell you that.\"\n\nWeinstein was a major donor for Trump's political rival Hillary Clinton. \n\nEpstein happened:\n\nThe real estate rivalry between Trump and Epstein occurred in the early 2000's. \n\nTrump was attempting to sell a property in Palm Beach, and Epstein showed interest in buying it. However, the deal fell through. One of the reasons given for this was that Trump was unwilling to sell the property to Epstein after learning more about his activities and the kind of reputation Epstein had developed. This rejection led to a reported confrontation between the two men, and, in a turn of events, Palm Beach police were reportedly called when Epstein became upset.\n\nI know this is very long but it's honestly totally crazy. Like right out of the movies. Trump is freaking vicious. The guy had a hand in strategically bringing down one of the most powerful moguls in Hollywood and even sacrificed himself to do it. Clinton's people release his locker room talk tape and the guy gets even. They all have dirt on each other, but he's a lot better at manipulation. Weinstein was ruined, eaten by his own people and guys like Perlman even said, (paraphrasing) \"Not all of use are equally guilty.\" Ha, something to hide perhaps? \n\nSo no, Trump is not afraid of Kamala IMO. Hollywood appears to be petrified of Trump.",

Definitely not anyone in America's history, or most first world countries for that matter. The combination of circumstances that created his personality, created his career and image, and led to his election feels like some kind of black swan event.\n\nThis is why I don't get too upset at people being blindsided by his victory in 2016. How and why would you possibly prepare for a phenomenon like him?\n\nInternationally, I feel like he has a lot in common with Berlusconi. He was also (seen as) a successful businessman, political outsider, populist, brash, \"impolite\" etc. I don't know that much about his political career but I'm aware of those basics.\n\nYou also have populists like Bolsonaro, and rogue soft authoritarians like Netanyahu and Erdogan where you could draw some comparisons, but many differences too.\n\nIf I'm taking a long view, I personally think and hope that history will remember him as a bizarre blip more than anything. Sort of like how Spain was randomly a fascist dictatorship for like 40 years, but a democracy before and after. Or how Oliver Cromwell overthrew the monarchy but then it was reinstated after him.\n\nTl;dr my take is that W and Reagan are more representative of our political system, and Trump is more of a bizarro detour.",

Hillary lost to about 78k votes in the swing states. Political polling has their own methods just to find out what a group of peoples opinions are on various things at a given day. Two different things, two separate reasons why you see the elections are close.",

He says what he's told by the team he employs to win over the public.\n\nI honestly doubt he gives a fuck either way. That's why he's sucking up to both sides to earn brownie points with \"the people\".  Like the scripted advertisement he is. #\ufe0f\u20e3BuyTeremana\n\nThat way, wheoever wins, he'll come out on top. Looking like an even more vanilla scrotum fac",
         "He put out a public statement that he regrets voting for Biden",
         "He's almost certainly an Econ republican. I'm waiting for Homelander Cody to be anti-racist, LGBT Ally, Covid Complaint, and still run for governor as a Republican because he's a rich man from a rich family that pretended to be poor for 60 years as a gimmick.",
         "A lot of it is the Very Wealthy losing sight of the rest of us. They're single-issue folks who don't have the problems we have so they look out for their money first and foremost.",

         "Dude's wife was literally in attendance at J6 and he's donated lots to the Trump campaign, dude is a full on piece of shit.

         "Economy, Border crisis, 2A, Abortion.",
         "We're talking about the popular vote, not the electoral college.  Biden won a close *popular vote*.  It was 4.5%.  If I flipped a coin 100 times, and 51 times was heads and 47 was tails, and you weren't allowed to count, you would have no idea which you saw more of.  You'd have to say \"I don't know, roughly the same\".\n\nYou're being ridiculous.",

This was me at least, went from being Libertarian, Centrist Republican, to Centrist to Centrist Democrat.\n\nWould still classify myself as an Independent, but my voting record has become increasingly skewed towards democrats.

         ">Libertarians in this country are just Republicans who like weed\n\nThat is a very innocent way of putting it and almost downright deceptive....\n\nLibertarians want to destroy and weaken the federal government to the point that it doesn't impact them. The Libertarians in America are closer to Fascism or Autocracy than any other party that gets talked about.\n\nThe Libertarian Establishment is entirely compromised at this point by Billionaires and Republicans it should always be treated as a republican proxy.\n\nFor a long time now the Republicans and Billionaires have scouted universities and recruited young libertarians to shill right wing politics and very little people seem to be aware. There is a reason both Peter Thiel and JD Vance had rich republican boyfriends that funded them in college and afterwards they immediately try to destroy the democracy. \n\nThe issue is the true libertarians are more further right wing than the republicans. They actually want to destroy the united states where as the republicans just want to grift and enrich themselves and the billionaires.",
         "> Libertarians in this country are just Republicans who like weed\n\nAnd... other things. You go far enough down US Libertarian ideology and you'll always hit a desire to get rid of age of consent laws.",

         "I would bet that he's not fearful, more that he's opportunistic.  He's going to see which way the wind blows after this election and that will help him to decide whether he should present himself as a Republican or Democrat if he decides to run for office.",

         "> Their policy as of late is more in line with my politics\n\nIt's just the overton window being constantly shifted to the right. Much of Reagan's policy would be called left-wing, socialist, or commie now. A lot of modern Democrats sound a bit like 1990s era Republicans.",
         "Wow are you me?",

Arnold Palmer had it all, and a much bigger package to work with, let me tell you! Remember when he was in the showers after a golf match, and even Dick Van Dyke would admire Palmer's manhood, \"Oh, my God! Look at that!\" But Dick Van Dyke just didn't have it. That's why he has a lesbian last name. He must be a closet lesbian. Or a lesbian that wishes she had a dick. He was nothing to Arnold Palmer,. . .",

It really depends on how mad they got, and if other Caribbean natives were insulted by the comments as well. They kind of have that relationship of \"I can make fun of my sibling but you can't\".",

Often race is more nuanced, and its about money as much as ancestry or skin color. \n\nSo due to the cultural construct of whiteness, you get Cuban-Americans sometimes being starkly reminded that they aren't fully part of the system due to their last name, even if they might otherwise \"pass\" and get the advantages of being whiteness. \n\nWhat really drives me nuts about this is conservative Catholics who don't realize that if Christian Nationalists ever win, they are all in serious danger.",

However, there's a decent amount who vote for both parties, so I'm not sure if those stats capture that phenomenon. It also doesn't take into account that many Cubans can't vote since they aren't citizens yet.\n\n>always found it bewildering that many Cubans voted Trump despite that.\n\nRepublicans did a hardcore propaganda campaign towards this demo during the Cold War and convinced many of them that Dems were either commies or commie-sympthetic, or too weak against the regime. \n\nMy anecdotal experience is that support for Republicans among Cubans is much lower among those who arrived after 1994. (though some say many from the Mariel generation became Dems because of the racist backlash against them in Miami at the time, but I don't know the exact numbers).",
         "You're right but I think most Haitians were voting Dem anyway and Florida is pretty deep red. The Puerto Rico joke was especially bad from a strategic perspective because something like 30% to 40ish% of Puerto Ricans living in the U.S. vote Republican, and a razor thin swing state - Pennsylvania - has a large Puerto Rican community that could flip the state entirely by itself. I'm not sure if Haitians alone could flip Florida. I don't even think Haitians and Puerto Ricans together could flip Florida.",
         "What?",
         ">So due to the cultural construct of whiteness, you get Cuban-Americans sometimes being starkly reminded that they aren't fully part of the system due to their last name, even if they might otherwise \"pass\" and get the advantages of being whiteness. \n\nPretty much. If you're a white Hispanic, they just won't consider you white. Even if they do, it doesn't mean you'll be treated equally. White nationalists simultaneously believe race is an objective biological thing that exists *and* that if you have blonde hair and blue eyes but your last name is Rodriguez or Goldstein then you're not actually white. Racists themselves are the biggest proof that race is a social construct and not something biological.\n\n>What really drives me nuts about this is conservative Catholics who don't realize that if Christian Nationalists ever win, they are all in serious danger.\n\nMainstream Christian nationalism in the U.S. tends to be somewhat inclusive of Catholics. After all, many of the prominent figures - Kevin Roberts, JD Vance, Nick Fuentes, John McEntee, etc. - are Catholic. Heck, Peter Thiel and Elon Musks are atheists and part of that movement. \n\nBut it's a temporary and convenient alliance: if they get power, they're gonna set their sights on Catholics, Mormons, Orthodox, any liberal Protestant churches, etc. Latinos are often stuck in a Catholic bubble (language barrier doesn't help) and often don't know that a lot of Evangelical Protestants really hate Catholics.",

I'm also white passing and as a kid I was told several times \"speak English, this is America\" or \"go back to your country\". They hate us not just for our color, but also our language, religion, culture, music, etc. That's something I often try to get through the heads of white Latinos who vote Republican because they want to be accepted into American whiteness: they hate some white immigrants too. \n\nShit dude, I've heard Canadians say that Anglo right-wingers up there don't even want *Ukrainian* refugees. Those fucks hate the Quebecois for being Catholic and French-speaking, you think they're gonna accept Orthodox Christians who speak a Slavic language and use a different alphabet? White supremacists don't usually support all white groups equally, they almost always have a hierarchy of whiteness and they almost always have certain white groups they hate.

At best.\n\nBut you\u2019re not here to listen or to argue in good faith or do anything but browbeat us and hold the lives of people in Gaza hostage to blackmail us for votes. To have a convenient scapegoat ready at hand for a potential defeat in the elections, instead of confronting the fact that half your country, the great majority of them white people, are voting for the fascist of their own free will.\n\nWhether or not Trump wins doesn\u2019t matter - the hate and the genuine popularity of xenophobia in the United States is already festering, and Donald just pulled it out into the open. Donald will be gone one way or another. The fascism will still be there in 2028 and beyond. You\u2019ll forget all about Gaza as ancient history.

         "I think a lot of white folks in the U.S. define \"white\" in their head as people who look vaguely Nordic (so basically northern and eastern Europeans). If you look vaguely Mediterranean, they just don't consider you white, even if you're pale. I'm not pale but I'm not tan either, but my hair and eyes are dark brown, I can grow a prickly dense beard, I have a hairy body, and my eyes and nose shape are typical of a Spaniard or Italian (I basically look like a slightly chubby Maluma without tattoos, down to the skin tone and everything).\n\nI work at a retail home improvement store and we don't have uniforms, so we can wear whatever we want (except jewelry when we operate machines). On days where I dress like a \"white\" person (black tee and beige cargos), the Latino customers either ask me questions first in English because they think I'm not Latino, or ask me if I know Spanish because they have a hunch I might be one but they're not sure. If they don't know English, they ask for a translator, and that's when I surprise them with Spanish.\n\nOn days where I dress more stereotypically Latino (baggy blue jeans, white Nike basketball shoes, earrings, thin gold chain and a watch), like 95% of the time the Latino customers immediately ask me questions in Spanish. They just know. In recent years I've been dressing more like this basically as a response to MAGA (I also just like the style) and to signal to other Latinos that I'm one of them and that they can talk to me in Spanish.\n\nI'll tell you this: when I was in K-12, I never perceived myself as being the same race as the blonde/ginger white kids. After all, those kids insisted I wasn't white, and Latinos themselves use \"blanco\" to mean northern Europeans when talking in an American context (in a Latin American context, I would be considered *blanco* by other Latinos, but I suddenly become *not* white when in an American context). So I didn't perceive myself as white because all the cultural messaging I was getting was telling me I wasn't. I perceived myself as Hispanic and nothing else. When I first played Skyrim, I selected Imperial rather than Nord. The cultural messaging runs deep.",
         "\"Whiteness\" is really a deliberate construction of not-black.

Castes other than white and black were pretty ancillary until recently.",

So Native and Asian heritage mostly got overlooked (Chang Bunker and Eng Bunker, the famous conjoined twins, were considered white in North Carolina, and married white women and owned slaves). Mixed race people might pass themselves off as Native to get around the social and legal restrictions of being black.\n\nBut out west, Latino, Asian and Native heritage mattered a lot more, like in NE when large Irish populations started to come, or the Mid Atlantic with Italians. \n\nYou can see how narrow whiteness was to some by literature. An insane example is the poem \"*Providence in 2000 A.D*\" by HP Lovecraft, which shows his bigoted view on what is white is very limited, with French and Swedes among the many groups he sneers at it."

         "I was reading a book about Reagan and FDR recently and the way that both of those men shaped our modern political landscape is astounding. Reagan in particular, everything about him screamed 'proto-Trump' it was uncanny. Immediately there's the obvious comparisons such as how they were both divorced despite campaigning on a religious platform or that Trump and Reagan were both celebrities turned politicians - though Trump's transition was much more dramatic - however their rhetoric also seems to be strikingly similar. I guess Reagan also severely leaned into this super-evangelical  'America is God's chosen land' rhetoric that's become disturbingly prominent with the GOP. Furthermore he also had the same 'just keep say things with enough confidence and it becomes reality' philosophy that Trump seems to have when giving a speech. I suppose that, like Trump, many of the anecdotes and facts Reagan would share in speeches were just patently false but because he said it with enough conviction his supporters would believe it. It also doesn't help that the political philosophy of both presidents is shaped by convincing American's that they're victims of high taxation, something which is bitterly ironic to anyone aware of taxation statistics. Finally, though a bit pedantic, I guess Reagan also believed in astrology meaning Trump was nowhere near the first time complete pseudoscience had entered the white house, though even then at the time it seems like conservatives had enough of a spine to criticize Reagan for this while nowadays conservatives celebrate Trump for believing conspiracy theories.\n\nObviously there's differences, Reagan for example at least demonstrated some level of competency and respectability that Trump seriously lacks, but the similarities are staggering. In my mind Reagan was really just the template for creating an absolutely god-awful president like Trump.",

His aides admitted it. \n\n> \"Law and Order\" rhetoric\n\nBit confused, that is what Nixon's public campaign face was in the general election vs LBJ. He just dressed up the racist rhetoric with the \"Forgotten American\" rhetoric so it played better with a broader audience. \n\n>Regan famously changed a lot of policies, antitrust is one with a lot of consequences. His admin basically paved the way for corporate growth and consolation to concentrate wealth the way it has... but that's what he was elected to do.

I can get people may have been fooled the first time (though... really?) but we've seen it fail\n\nHe indeed failed the middle class. The wage vs productivity decoupling was greatly accelerated post 1980s, not to mention the national debt ballooning. I don't think that's what the people elected him to do though. They saw Carter as weak because of the Iran hostage situation (which Reagan illegally rat fucked with btw), and the economy  had been struggling for last 4-5 years. Jimmy as weak on the global stage, weak on the economy, and too invasive with his \"big government\". In fact, just another thing the Trump campaign has latched on to from Reagan's campaign \"are you better off than you were 4 years ago?\"...

A Trump vote in Massachusetts or a Harris vote in Oklahoma hold the same impact as a Chase Oliver or Cornel West in the majority of this country. \n\nThe main difference? \n\nVoting third party means that if a third party gets five percent, they get federal election funding. Meaning this two party system everyone bitches about but still bizarrely still want to protect (the vote blue no matter who or better red than dead crowds) would be a thing of the past. \n\nHowever, in my experience, most voters don't actually care about 'fixing the system' any more than voting for one of the two major parties, more often than not the Democratic party. \n\nWe can act upon the work that Fairvote does and advocate RCV too, but we much rather mindlessly go 'TEAM BLUE OR TEAM RED' instead. Neither the Republican or Democratic parties want RCV, though, because it would squash their holds on voting power in the US. Both parties want you to be compliant, pick a side, and just shut up. The true fact of the matter is that we have an 'illusion' of choice and that's all that it will be until real reform is done and we have parties and candidates that represent more than just the far right and whatever the democrats feel like running as that current cycle.",

But despite that, I would vote for her, without any doubt. Because every vote matters. Because you are choosing between her or an autocrat. Because we know what Trump is going to do if he is president. Because you need to stop this madness, once and for all. Right now, we all can lose much more than 4 years of a republican government. We can lose an ally in the geopolitical struggle against autocracies, we can lose the fight to prevent the worst effects against global warming, we can lose the war against the fake news. We can lose the war in Ukraine or a determent against a Chinese war in Taiwan, or conflicts in the Korean Sea. We can lose the credibility of the most influential democracy in the world.\n\nSo, please, every vote matters. Every vote against Trump must be under Kamala. Because every vote against freedom, justice and democracy will be under Trump.",

Reaganomics is single handedly responsible for the giant wealth transfer from the working/middle class to the billionaire/investor class.  I agree with you about Glass-Steagall, plus, honestly, a majority of Americans bought the bullshit, or close to a majority in the case of Bush/Gore.\n\nIt is not unfair to hold the Republican party accountable for their platform over the prior 40 years.  As far as giving people homes, they got them short term, then the banks got bailed out.  A lot of people were just literally destroyed, so they could live in a fancier house.\n\nI think the most damaging thing in the 90's was the change in the patent laws, which occurred under Clinton and made r & d much less profitable in the United States.  If we want an advancing tech sector, they need to be able to make their research actually pay when it does hit.\n\nHowever I like Harris so far, she's pragmatic, and I really like the Biden/Harris medicare reforms, and there is much more room there for cost savings and better outcomes for beneficiaries.  \n\nLets just hope she wins.",

         "I thank you for proving my point. \n\nThe two party system exists mainly because we allow it to exist.  More importantly, voting third-party is about much more than winning or losing; it is about expanding the platform of minority parties and independent candidates. That's what Democracy is. Having more choice and say. Not less. \n\nIf all of Jo Jorgensen's votes went to Trump in 2020, it wouldn't have made a difference, and Biden still would have won. \n\nYou live in Illinois? Say a voter there votes for Chase Oliver. According to 538 and the most available polling, Harris is leading Trump in that state 58 to 42 percent. \n\n\nPlease explain to me how a vote for any third party in Illnois is a 'vote for Donald Trump' when Harris is automatically gonna win that state? Newsflash: it isn't.\n\nA vote for Trump in IL, CT or *insert blue state here* is even more of a 'wasted vote' than a third party. In same regard a vote for Harris in Oklahoma or Mississippi is a 'wasted vote' because she has zero shot to win those states.",

         "And what is your proposed solution when only candidates those two sides can win a presidential election?",
         "It\u2019s not about \u201callowing it to exist\u201d, it\u2019s about a collective action problem that will necessarily result in it existing. If we want to solve the collective action problem, we need to change our electoral system to something like ranked choice voting. Our current system requires voters to think strategically.\n\nAny \u201cexpanded platform\u201d for third parties will necessarily come at the cost of established parties, resulting in a split vote. Say I vote for noted grifter Jill Stein: I would be helping to split the Democratic vote in my state, which would necessarily benefit Republicans in my state. I\u2019m lucky that my state is solid blue, but *the last thing I would want to do* is enable a left-oriented third party (by American standards) to gain traction for runs in other, more competitive states.\n\n\nSo by your logic, if I voted for Trump, I wouldn\u2019t be helping Trump win Illinois because he was just gonna lose anyway? That\u2019s absurd.",
         "Respectfully, this is a talking point based on the experience that in my country the vote division on the left and the concentration in the right led to more right -winged governments that I would like, despite more people voted for left-leaning parties.\n\nLike it or not, Trump is a threat to democracy, and this is not an issue to take it lightly. You are not going to accomplish anything dividing the anti Trump vote. Because, even if you achieve this 5%, those votes would be votes lost (or not won) by Kamala. This will increase Trump margin. And, I hope not to be correct, but under a Trump victory, I would worry more about avoiding to implement a one party system than to implement a three/four/N party system.\n\nAnd this is not a talking point. This worry was not under Bush Jr., Bush Sr. or Reagan. This election is different. The worry here is not to win or lose an election. Is to win or lose democracy. And, respectfully, failing to understand that is a disservice you make to the democracy you say you want to protect",
         "Delegitimize the vote by abstaining or vote for a third party.",
         "You can call it absurd, but it's a reality.  The only reason this reality exists as it is, is because we have the Electoral College. Under that model, your vote only matters if you live in one of a handful of states. That's harsh to say but it's fundamentally true. If you live in a decided state your vote does matter, but more so within the down ballot races. As it stands now, a vote in Illnois is different than a vote in Pennsylvania.  It's in my opinion, absurd to think otherwise. \n\nWe as Americans have every right to change this in our country. We simply choose not to. To be fair however, ranked choice voting has been implemented in states like Alaska and Maine and both states seem to like its implementation where it's been more than not, a success.",
         "This worry was 100 percent seen under Bush. Rightfully so, Bush was a war criminal whose administration bombed and invaded not one but two wrong countries after the horrific 9/11 attacks. \n\nAs a European, it should give you pause that under the Biden/Harris administration, the Taliban are selling weapons we purposely left in the Middle East during the withdrawal of Afghanistan. \n\nIt should give you pause that the same Kamala Harris who tries to talk like a progressive is in bed with Blackrock. \n\nhttps://nypost.com/2021/01/08/kamala-harris-top-economic-advisor-is-another-blackrock-exec/\n\nBlackrock BTW is the same investment firm that is actively buying up single family homes. \n\nIt also should give you great pause that under the Biden/Harris administration, deportations were on track to be higher than the first term of Trump. \n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/graphics/USA-ELECTION/MIGRATION-DEPORTATIONS/akpeoeoerpr/\n\nhttps://cbsaustin.com/news/local/biden-on-track-to-exceed-trump-obama-in-deportations-in-first-term-data-shows\n\nIf you think either candidate isn't a threat to immigrants, you are strongly mistaken. \n\nThe reason why Harris has been attracting a lot of billionaires and disenfranchised Republicans is because she's not gonna govern like a progressive, she is going to govern like a Bush era Republican. Both are oppressive choices. I respectfully think both spit in the face of democracy.\n\nHarris has an oppressive record as a prosecutor, where during this time, she cost the city of California millions of dollars, convicting a man who was not guilty of the crime he was accused of\n\nShe has also used prisoners as 'cheap labor' \n\nhttps://www.kqed.org/news/12000397/what-9-cases-from-kamala-harris-past-say-about-her-record-as-a-california-prosecutor\n\nThis person, is a terrible choice to be president. Simple as that. Nor, to be frank do I think she cares about the every day person she pretends to care about. Just because Donald Trump is monstrous does not mean someone else who undeniably has an equally horrifying record means she is 'less horrifying'. All it means is that both candidates are horrifying.",

Here\u2019s why:\n\n1.\tGlobal Impact: U.S. decisions on climate change, international trade, and global security affect everyone. Your vote influences policies that ripple far beyond American borders.\n\n2.\tStand Up for Democratic Values: Voting is a powerful way to shape and protect democracy. In a world facing challenges to freedom and rights, every voice for fair representation matters.\n\n3.\tAddress Shared Issues: From healthcare and education to climate action, many of the issues at stake in the U.S. elections are universal. Your vote impacts progress on these critical fronts.\n\nSo if you\u2019re eligible, please vote today! You\u2019re not only choosing leaders for the U.S.; you\u2019re helping shape a world many of us believe in and support. Make your voice heard\u2014today counts!",

         "Not a fan of Taylor Swift. Her entire persona is so meticulously curated that nothing feels real and her fanbase couldn't be more annoying if they tried. But, it's impossible to argue that her influence didn't help Biden win in 2020, which is why I was so critical of her for not endorsing Harris earlier in the race. She had already set a precedent by endorsing Biden in 2020, and to top it off, Trump was blatantly lying about her endorsement and posting fake AI images of her. Her reluctance to take a stance in the face of all of that was disappointing and frustrating.\n\nAll of that being said, I still appreciated how important it was for her fanbase to mobilize in this election in the same way it did in 2020, so I was relieved and grateful of her finally announcing her endorsement of Harris. Every vote matters so better late than never.\n\nBut now, today, on Election Day, when the final push is needed as much as possible and people need to be mobilized to finally, actually vote for ***Harris***, the candidate Taylor very publicly endorsed...all she can muster up is a single throwaway line about a reminder to vote? You already endorsed Harris! What could possibly be the motive to not highlight that?? Remind people of it! Remind them where their demi-god idol stands in this race! Make your Trump fans uncomfortable! Force them to reckon with their decisions! Shove it in their faces! Go big! Say it with your chest and let Brittany Mahomes hear it! If there were any \"damage\" to be done by endorsing Harris, it's already been done! What are you holding back for at this point??\n\nI just don't understand her logic with this election. A reminder to get out and vote is good, but it's so lukewarm and conspicuously non-partisan. Yes, as I mentioned, she did very publicly endorse Harris already, so who's to say another message about it on Election Day would move the needle much at this point. But it just feels so strange and unnecessary to...avoid it? It goes back to everything being so meticulously curated. Leaving out any mention of Harris/Walz is absolutely deliberate and it brings me back to that same feeling of disappointment and frustration. It all just feels directly contradictory to the curated persona of feminist ally, and it bothers me to see another powerful billionaire quietly hedge their bets at a time that demands principled stands.",

Her endorsement of Harris was timed just so when everyone was watching the news after the debate, it started to come through onto the news networks. It created a hell of a Youtube clip of Walz being all 'Shucks, I'm honored' and generally being Walz when they told him in real time on live TV that Swift had endorsed them. The timing wasn't some random whim, she was actively working with the campaign.",
         "Reminder that Harris has run one of, if not the, shortest campaigns for a major party in American history.\n\n\nShe was nominated at the end of August and the debate came less than 3 weeks after that so an endorsement couldn't have come *that* much sooner.\n\n\nI don't know that endorsing before the debate would have made sense. The debate was the largest publicly viewed event Harris had to introduce herself to the nation as a candidate and talk about herself and her platform in contrast to Trump. Taylor's endorsement right after it ended also served as a timely reminder to anyone that didn't watch the debate to go watch it.",

         "Yo, I'm not the one who originally levied criticism and I already said my piece about her resources. I'm not gonna get into it with y'all. We're talking political action, not her tour schedule. EVERYONE has shit going on. SHE has billions of fans and money. Whether she SHOULD have done more or not isn't what I've been talking about, only that she COULD have done more if that were her intent because she has the resources, in response to a previous comment, and that I am happy she has spoken up. \\*Elated\\* even.\n\nI think we should bracket the tour thing as a factor here. I don't think it's fair even to Swift, for some reason I feel like that kinda undermines her agency or makes it out like she's not capable to walk and chew gum at the same time. She did walk and chew gum at the same time. I'm as stoked about what her actions could mean for future youth engagement as I am about her endorsement for Harris (well, almost). Getting out the vote is huge. So I think for my part it's good to have these conversations about stars' ability and responsibility when they get involved in political messaging. Whether you're a STAN or not she's a cultural force and that comes with a heavy dose of both. I am not a political strategist, so I can't say whether things would have been better if done differently, only that it's possible. Go Swifties.",
         "Oh God yeah no I don't know if that would have been good either. I agree with you. My original comment was only saying that the tour piece shouldn't be considered a huge barrier. What more or better action could look like for Swift, smarter people than me will have to say.",

As the ultra wealthy generally lean conservative for their own benefit, the politicians they give money to will inevitably begin to lean that way as well. This is why we need to get money out of politics. Unfortunately, as long as money is in politics, the out-funding of the other party will inevitably be needed to win elections, and taking money from mega-donors will inevitably involve making icky promises and watering down left-wing politicians\u2019 platforms.",

She has to tend the kids so she doesn't really have time for the celeb stuff.  She also toned down her shtick after Pat's manager and PR people had a long talk with her. I'm not defending her in any way, she is still immature and entitled...but most 20-somethings today seem to be that way too.\n\nSure if Brit wasn't mahomes' wife, Swift wouldn't give her the time of day, but in the end this is just the 'politics of personality and fame'.

An additional 1 million votes are expected by the time polls close, marking another significant turnout for the Peach State.\n\nRaffensperger, speaking at a press conference, emphasized efforts to enhance voter security and speed in reporting. Raffensperger noted that voters have experienced short wait times, with average check-in times under a minute. \n\n\"It\u2019s been smooth sailing by and large,\" he said. \u201cAverage line time in Georgia right now is two minutes.\"\n\nAccording to Senate Bill 189, which mandates reporting early and absentee ballots within one hour after polls close at 7 p.m., nearly all early votes should be in by 8 p.m., Raffensperger said.

The log number should match the number across the machines. No one knows who voted for what at that point, just how many people have voted.\n\nAt the end of the night, at the polling place after voting concludes, each machine will print out multiple reports with the tallied results, one gets filed with the county, one with the state, one is posted publicly, and one is sent home with the minority inspector of elections (minority inspector is usually required to be from the opposite party as the judge of elections). Every report is signed off on by both inspectors, the judge, clerk, and all present machine operators.\n\nThen the minority inspector and judge of elections take those reports, as well as the USB/media backing them up, as well as all ballots, to the county seat for tabulation, together (same vehicle if possible) to prevent tampering.\n\nThe county seat is where the counting actually happens and elected observers are present.\n\nSource: was a judge of elections and inspector of elections for PA until 2022",

It's a dense damned county.\n\nHowever, that one county is significant: without it, we likely can't be sure of the winner.  So PA probably won't be called until Philadelphia County is almost fully counted.  I think the only thing that will allow for an early calling of Pennsylvania is if there is a clear blue shift in non-Philly metro counties from 2020 to 2024.

She's charting pretty much where Obama was during his first election, and we know how things turned out there. \n\nFurther, Trump is losing women over 65 by a lot. They spent a chunk of their youth trying to claw away rights from the patriarchy, only to watch the GOP and Trump steal the fruits of their hard work/sacrifice away. They're rightly pissed off.

Specifically Gore requested a manual recount of 62,000 ballots where no presidential candidate was selected due to the \"hanging chads.\" \n\nThe Florida Secretary of State certified that Bush had won the election before the recounts were completed. Gore sued the Secretary of State and the Florida Supreme Court sided with Gore, allowing the recounts to finish. Bush appealed to the US Supreme Court and they immediately halted the recount. \n\nSo not quite as clear cut as you portray it.

They were estimating that something like 90% of the people registered to vote with that education level would vote, when even at the height of Trump's popularity the number was close to 60%.\n\nIn other words: who the fuck knows what the results will be.

Part of what got us into this mess was decades of many normal people not voting and allowing more and more crazies into office, from school boards all the way to the top of the ticket. That's why voter turnout is such a bad thing for the right because they know what they want is unpopular. Their best chance at control is lower turnout.

It can also cause a candidate with extreme viewpoints to have a well funded primary opponent the next time around because people in their party might be afraid they won't keep winning.\n\nThe long game and local level matters.",

So now it MIGHT be the case (based on some of these highly reputable polls showing completely different data) that those polls are heavily weighing their polls toward Trump so they aren\u2019t wrong again. Also, it\u2019s possible they just want clicks and/or don\u2019t want to be wrong so they say \u201coh it\u2019s a coin flip! 49/49 or 48/48 with 2% undecided!\u201d",
         "You can read about it on a lot of technical wonky/statistics blogs (meaning this isn't some super secret), but the short answer is that they don't know how to get Trump right in polls.\n\nThe basic fear is that they have overcorrected, because they were wrong in both 2016 and 2020 (Biden won but they had him winning by more than he did in 2020, for example). So, the idea is that they have now overcorrected for it and are weighing Trump voters more/too much. Now, they could have gotten the models right this time, but there are a few reasons that might not be the case:\n\n1. They aren't capturing some demographic that is behaving in a non-traditional manner (in 2016/2020 they weren't capturing the male white working class pissed off voters that broke for Trump). If Iowa is right, this time they might not be capturing pissed off white women correctly. This could be an across the board problem, but because Selzer does her polls in a pretty different way, her model is hard to replicate outside of Iowa (also note that Iowa just banned abortion, I think).\n2. It's unlikely that every state everywhere is statistically tied: again this would be connected to overcorrecting, but we should see a little more variation than we are seeing.\n3. There are weird things going on with down-ballot races. If you look at 538 and at a few polls you'll see it. In Nevada for example the Senate race is looking pretty good for Dems but Trump is up on the presidential ballot. That means that 4-8% (in some states), will have split votes heavily favoring a Dem in the Senate and Trump at the top. This just seems odd. It could be possible, but is odd.\n4. The big one: Nobody knows how to poll anymore. The under 45 crowd doesn't answer the phone. Apparently, even when Gen Z does answer the phone they lie or just say undecided when they aren't (this could go either way). People that never voted seem to be voting this year too.\n\nBut, all this tea leaf reading at this point. Just need to vote and see what happens. Anyone acting certain at this point isn't being honest.

If the US removed the two party registration, making everyone \"Undeclared\" or just nothing, make the day a national holiday so it gives everyone the opportunity and also everyone is automatically registered to vote at 18 then I think we'd be better off.\n\nEDIT:  This response took off.  Later we discuss that making it a holiday isn't enough.  Making sure proper protection is in place to allow for workers that have to work be it hospitals, food service, fire/police, 24 hour IT positions.  Feel free to correct me further, but the employee protection now only says that if you're working while polls are open that employers have to allow you to vote.  Leaving an 8 hour shift to vote might not be covered by all slimy employers if you had the opportunity to vote prior to or after said shift.",
         "Because Republicans.  If it\u2019s a Holiday, more people will vote.   They don\u2019t want that because they are unpopular.   See:   Every popular vote for the past 20 years or so.",

         "More people would vote.\n\nRepublicans hate people voting.",
         "I know it's a popular idea but having a federal holiday for Election Day would not really benefit the lower income workers and the working poor, who happen to be the people most likely to need a little help getting their votes in.  Middle class, white collar workers would cast their votes early -- either by mail, early in person, or just stupidly early in the morning on Election Day -- then hit the shopping malls, bars, or restaurants, while retail, hospitality and gig workers had business as usual. \n\nBetter suggestions would be federal minimums on drop boxes and polling places per 10k residents; federal minimums on in-person polling hours on weekends, late nights and early mornings; longer periods of early voting; and same-day registration.",
         "Even with an extra two weeks of early voting, some lines were still 2 hours long. What if all the millions of citizens had to vote on one day, as Trump keeps fantasizing about. Even if it was a holiday, the millions could stand in line for 24 hours and still not reach the polls.",
         "People have to work on holidays too. It doesn't really matter. As long as there are a lot of early voting and mail-in options everyone should be able to vote. Making the process more than one day, as has happened lately, is the real answer.",

Sure, people still work on weekends, but a lot fewer people do.",

If I didn't have to work today, I would have used a vacation day yesterday and taken a nice 4-day weekend trip somewhere, so I'd be less likely to vote. \n\nThe real solution is universal mail-in ballots and at least 1 week of early in-person voting.",
         "Because the GOP wants to make it harder to vote so fewer people can, rather than make it easier.",
         "Because for many Americans there's no such thing as holidays in the United States.",
         "The people who have the kinds of jobs that won\u2019t give them time off to go vote would then be more likely able to go vote.",
         "Because Republicans want the fewest amount of people to vote as possible, and especially not the poor and middle class who have to work for a living.",
         "Answer: Republicans have blocked every attempt to move voting day to the weekend or declare it a national holiday.\n\nWhy would they do that?\n\nWhile Republicans have a very loud and enthusiastic voting bloc, they have very unpopular stances on most issues and rarely produce any specific plans other tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans and corporations. On other issues, they offer only grievances and vague claims to \"fix\" them without saying how (see Trump's \"concepts of a plan\" after 10 years of attacking and trying to kill the ACA).\n\nBecause their platform is unpopular to people who understand and pay attention to the issues, they get support by creating culture wars and outrage by spinning isolated incidents into full-blown nation-wide disasters that will destroy families and threaten safety (see trans people using restrooms or the powerful Christian majority somehow being constantly under threat and \"forced\" to attack religious freedom for all other religions so that they can survive), and calling their opponents scary buzzwords that don't even mean what the Republican base thinks they mean (communist, Marxist, socialist, etc.) and are not remotely true of the people they label with their name-calling.\n\nBut even with the rabid base they earn from these culture wars, they're still in the minority. So they use every tool in their disposal to limit the vote, throw out votes, and select their voters. The more voters there are, the less likely Republicans will win. That's why mid-term elections without the presidential vote on the ballot often rewards Republicans because many people don't bother voting in those \"less important\" elections\u2014but the rabid Republicans would never miss a vote. Most importantly, it comes down to Republicans choosing their voters by gerrymandering districts (cutting them into crazy shapes so that they'll mathematically reduce Democratic votes into fewer districts\u2014a state with 10 districts where Democrats soundly win the popular vote will often fall to Republican control anyway by numbers like 7-3 because of gerrymandering. And then the electoral college gives extraordinary power to rural communities and low population states, making the overall popular vote irrelevant to who actually wins the presidency. For example, when a voter in the densely populated state of California votes, that vote has something like 1/50 the power of someone who lives in a cabin in the woods of Montana. The GOP then uses all of these advantages that got them in power to keep those advantages in place: they protect their \"right\" to gerrymander and choose their voters, they insist on keeping the electoral college to cancel out the popular vote, they want the filibuster to suppress the voter's desires once in office, and they appoint partisan judges to lock in unpopular partisan positions as the law of the land, and they block legislative votes from even taking place on things majority (sometimes in 90% range) desperately want... like a national holiday for voting, sensible gun laws, immigration reform (so they can use it as an outrage issue), etc.\n\nWhy don't the voters get angry and turn on the Republicans for all of this manipulation? Well, because the media on the right paints an entirely different reality from the one we all live in that propels all of those concocted outrages into the mainstream conversations. The media outlets in the middle fear being called biased so much, they both-sides every argument even when one side is not operating in good faith... and it gives credibility to the craziness on the far right as if it could be real. And then the people on the left trying to herd people back to reality are labeled far left extremists and soundly ignored\u2014except for the ones already sitting inside their bubble. So, no matter how far the right drifts away from reality, the media follows them into their fever dreams making them seem real... which in a way, kind of makes them real simply because that's how they're perceived.\n\nBut the vast majority of Americans\u2014when asked about the issues without party identification\u2014agree on most everything. So it benefits Republicans to keep information low so their faithful don't realize how their policies hurt them, and keep their loyal followers turning out by hammering them with a barrage of disinformation and outrage\u2014while keeping Democratic turn-out low by creating helplessness and apathy over the lack of knowledge on the other side and the impotence of actual facts.\n\nHowever, if Democrats get fired up and show up, Republicans will lose every time. So they want voting to be hard, they want to choose who gets to vote, and they want to dictate how they vote.",

This makes registration necessary because different states have different rules and procedures for elections.\n\nFor example, lets say you're a felon.

It would be the same as a slow shift or a shift with virtually no customers.\n\nThe way I see it, is if Election day is a holiday, less people are working. Those that are still required to/need to work, should be mandated 4 hours of PTO to go vote. If they only need 30 minutes, they can go back to work and bank that PTO like any other time off. Most businesses could rotate shifts so coverage shouldn't be an issue (in hospitals for example).\n\n[Average wait times have been dropping since 2008](https://elections-blog.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/single_image_small_2x/public/2021-11/1%20daZ87rXVPW6SzfyYzOnKdA.png?itok=vBUr3Id7) and 30 minutes covers ~80% of voters with today's format.",

You can go back another few decades and still not find any elections where the winner wasn\u2019t known the night of Election Day. Basically any state election that is close is going to take time to count all the ballots. If a state has counted 9 million votes and one candidate is up by 130K and there are still 500K to count then the winner can\u2019t be declared until those enough of those votes are counted. In most states by the time 3/4 of the votes are counted they can declare a winner.\n\nGetting an ID to vote is free. Some red states make it harder to get one, but just like voting, adding any speed bump is enough to stop tons of people from voting. Too many Americans take having voting rights for granted.\n\nIf a felon is allowed to vote is a state by state issue. Some allow them to some don\u2019t. In many states a felon can get their voting rights back but choose not to. You really need to understand that a lot of Americans couldn\u2019t care less about politics and will refuse to vote no matter how easy it is.",

         "You do realize that only US citizens (and noncitizen employees of DHS for some reason) can even get SSNs, right? Like, it's not difficult for the government to validate citizenship if they're doing their job.\n\nWhen I do my taxes in Canada, I check a box that says \"please share my details with the Elections Canada\". The government checks their own data to make sure I'm a citizen. Then when election time comes around, whether federal or provincial, I get a voter information card that tells me where to vote. I'm already registered. When I arrive at the voting station, I show my ID and the person at the desk checks that against their list of voters assigned to that polling station.\n\nIf I die, someone filling out my taxes make a mark noting that I'm dead and they don't check the box to give my details to the Election board. If I move, I put my new address on my tax forms, and I check the box. The voter information card is sent to my new address automatically.\n\nNow, if I move before I can do that, that's about the only time that things get hairy. But even then I can still vote by mail for my previous riding. Yes, I'd have to wait until filing my taxes again to be able to vote in my new riding, but, again, it's all done automatically. There's no such thing as purging voter rolls in Canada.",

It would be impossible to vote more than once at the polling place and it proves you're registered on their record books.  Now you do the same thing, but you have to prove it's you.  I'd be willing to bet there has never been a whole lot of people claiming to be someone else just to vote.",

The national government is not running our election system and you need the STATE government to verify all of this information. A lot of people don't even have ID or file taxes.

         "I know that isn't how things work in the US, but how it could or should work are the entire point of the article. Election Day isn't a holiday in the US, but it should be. Automatic voter registration isn't a thing in the US, but it should be, and it could be even at the state level because the state government knows all the same information about you that the federal government does.\n\nEven homeless people have SSNs, and vouching is still a recognized practice in much of the US. The census and government ID covers the people that don't file taxes. The solutions are simple. The fear of those solutions is what holds many politicians back.",
         "AFAIK rolls are regularly cross-check for the recently deceased to remove them from the books and identifying this kind of fraud is done after an election. While it might be possible to register in other people's names, the voter registration cards would be mailed to them tipping people off. \n\nThen it would be logistically very difficult to vote as other people on a scale that mattered. You have to show up to the right polling place, state the right name, and sign like the other person in the case of the deceased. What are you going to do, drive all around town to vote 3 or 4 times? Get back in line and hope they don't recognize you the second time you come through as somebody different? It might work for a few individuals, but organizing something like that to get thousands of votes ain't going to happen and combine this lack of payoff with a huge penalty if you're caught. Nope. Couldn't convince me this is real.\n\nBack in 2016 when \"bus loads of illegals were voting!\" I tried going over how exactly that plan would work with friends that would argue with me, so I thought it through. I didn't realize at the time they'd argue any insane thing that came out of that man's mouth because it's part of his \"power\" to disseminate lies.",

If IDs were the only method used control who votes, anyone could vote multiple times at multiple places.\n\nIf it turns out someone had voted in your name \u2014 that\u2019s a felony with very little pay off, so it doesn\u2019t happen more than a handful of times an election. You could even check at any time if you had voted. That is why the \u201csecure election\u201d narrative is much more about limiting those who don\u2019t have ID on hand than about election security.\n\nIn some ways, requiring an ID to vote is a common sense measure \u2014 but only if accompanied by the common sense measure of mailing people their free IDs.

I\u2019m not sure if this was user error on the poll workers part, but the affected voter just got a provisional ballot I think.

I went over to a booth, told them my name, a screen popped up on an ipad with my address and full name. I signed my name when they looked me up, got handed a paper ballot, filled it out and fed it into the 1 of 5 machines to count the vote. The machines are keyed to only accept ballots from that specific block of addresses. If I fed it into another machine, it would spit it back out.\n\nNow that I voted, my name is crossed off the list and nobody can say they are me, they'd have to present ID since I signed already. If my name was signed already, I would present ID, get a provisional ballot and the false vote would be flagged. \n\nIt's all tracked, just not WHO you vote for.",
         "The government in the US doesn't track where you live unless you tell them. This is primarily done through voter registration, driver's license registration, or when you pay taxes. When you get a driver's license, almost every state offers you the option to register to vote at the same time. When you file your taxes, there's often an option to be sent info on registering to vote.\n\nOther than driver's licenses, the government (state and federal) doesn't really have a database of where everyone lives. Even then, many people don't have driver's licenses, and many often don't update their DL when they move to a new address (although you're supposed to). Your address on tax returns is only updated when you file, and there's not really a way to change your address between annual filings.\n\nMost European countries require you to register your residence. We don't have this in the US. Registering to vote is essentially the same thing, except it's optional."

They'll be like, \"Trump? Trump who? ***I*** never voted for the guy\" or something to that effect. \n\nThe usual GOP policies, however, will continue on after Trump. There are plenty of other people in various positions outside of Trump. You have the majority conservative Supreme Court, you still have plenty of shameless GOP senators/governors, and you still have The Federalist Society. \n\nI think the one way that the Republican party could \"collapse\" would be if one of the other currently existing \"Independent\" parties gained a massive surge in public membership/endorsement by traditional GOP members, put forth competitive candidates in state level elections, and put forward a competitive candidate in the election after Trump is a fuzzy memory.

If he needs something from you he will lay the schmooze on like gravy, but the second he doesn\u2019t youre another loser who can be ignored.\n\nMichael Cohen, his old lawyer and close associate, details it well in his book. Trump bullied, berated and demeaned employees (and supposedly friends) all the time. If a bad decision was made by him it\u2019s THEIR fault for not talking him out of it. If they bring a deal and it flops it\u2019s THEIR fault for bringing him a shitty deal.

The GOP had the ability and plenty of time to shut him down long ago, but hid behind his popularity with his base so that they could get the power they sought (as you rightly said).\n\nI am also praying that tonight, we get to see his full demise on display and the beauty, joy and optimism of a Harris/Walz win.",

Like today, they were helping for their own reasons.  Hitler was going to be their tool to accomplish their goals.\n\nPaul von Hindenburg, President of Germany, didn't favor Hitler, but was talked into making him Chancellor, as a way of controlling radical elements, breaking the deadlock in Parliment.\n\nAlfred Hugenberg was a media tycoon who wanted to jump on the bandwagon of Hitlers populist, mass appeal, and increase his own influence in many areas.\n\nMany rich businessmen/industrialists saw Hitler as a tool to suppress leftist & labor movements, thinking Hitler would strengthen their economy and improve stability.  \n\nOnce Hitler gained power in 1933, he out-maneuvered them all.  He changed the rules of government that centralized much more power with him, allowing him to rule by decree & bypass parliment.  That was one of the big destabilizing moves that allowed him to sideline, imprison, or purge anyone who stood in his way.\n\nSound familiar?  Yet here we are, attempting to repeat history, to change government, do mass Fed Government firings (he expects thousands) & replace them with loyalists to centralize power/control, and a supreme court that already granted Trump immunity.  \n\nRepublicans, learn the past, before you are damned to repeat it.",

         "In 2016, the New York Times published a very detailed precinct-by-precinct online map of the vote totals in NYC.\n\nMost of it was very blue, as expected.  There were a few red pockets that didn't surprise me.  The vast majority of Staten Island went for Trump, which wasn't surprising because Staten Island has been a Republican stronghold for decades, for some convoluted set of reasons.  \n\nAnother unsurprisingly red chunk of the map was a neighborhood called Breezy Point, at the far western end of the Rockaway peninsula.  That neighborhood is literally a gated community on a private beach.  In NYC.  It's clearly the kind of absolutely insane wealth where people's main concern is \"When I die, I need to leave my yachts to my children, without them having to pay taxes on it.\"  So, no surprise there either.\n\nThere were however 2 other little red pockets within the city that made me scratch my head, and dig deeper to figure out \"What's going on there?\"\n\nOne pocket was Brighton Beach, just a little east of Coney Island.   I'd been Coney Island a handful of times.  I'd walked along the beach down to Brighton Beach from Coney Island.  That whole area always seemed like Mets-fan-working-class-NYC to me. It made no sense that Brighton Beach would be Republican.  But... I learned, that Brighton Beach is also known as \"Little Russia.\"  Not the explanation I was expecting to find, but certainly a clear explanation, of why that neighborhood would break for Trump.\n\nAnother red area that surprised me was a neighborhood called Middle Village, smack dab in the middle of Queens.  I had no experience with this area, and thusly didn't have any preconceived notions of how / why it would vote this way or that.  After a bit of googling though, I found out that back in the 70s and 80s, when NYC was genuinely a rough place... when Times Square was more like a red light district, than Disneyland... back when crime (both petty and violent) was genuinely out of control... The one safe neighborhood in the whole city was Middle Village.  Why?   Cause that's where all mafia top brass lived.  Every two-bit mugger and car thief and tweaked out addict knew not to fuck with anyone in that neighborhood, because the mob would find you, and respond 10-fold.\n\nSo... that's who voted for Trump in NYC, in 2016.   Russians, and the mob.  (And Staten Island and the insanely wealthy of Breezy Point).  The rest of the city knows him as the shitty grifter that he is.\n\nEdit: Some words and some grammar.\n\nEdit 2:  Apparently I made some very wrong assumptions about the demographics of Breezy Point.  Turns out it's not a super wealthy neighborhood (despite being a gated community on a private beach).  Apologies.",

This isn\u2019t leadership; it\u2019s theater, a performance scripted to channel resentment and grievance, to reflect back the audience\u2019s own discontent, distorted just enough to make him seem like an ally, not the very embodiment of what they claim to reject.  \n\n\nAnd that\u2019s precisely why it\u2019s working.

To them, as long as it's clear that they, a white person, control the interaction and the Black person will do what they're told, the racist is generally cordial. \n\nTo your actual point, it depends on how closeted their racism is. Where I grew up, there was a lot of racism, but it mostly happened outside of actual interactions with Black people. They'd bitch and moan about the Black person to their own family and friends, but in public they were civil. Some wouldn't acknowledge a Black person existed until circumstances called for it. Some wouldn't shake a Black person's hand or make any physical contact with them. If they had Black neighbors, they'd either eventually decide that they're some of the *good ones* or blame them for everything that goes wrong with their house/neighborhood and call the police on them for any minor thing. \n\n*Most* ^([citation needed]) racists I know just want Black people to stay *over there* and to *know their place* but it's never backed up with anything besides whining at home or with their friends. \n\nSince Trump has made it more socially acceptable to be racist in public, there's been a lot more overt racist things, like refusing to move out of the way on the sidewalk, spitting behind their backs, and generally loudly voicing complaints about \"those people\" when Black people are around. \n\nI haven't seen a resurgence of burning crosses or throwing bricks through windows, but if Trump ends up as president, I'd expect those events to follow.",

They've heard loud and clear that the GOP is the party of \"we don't care if carrying your rapist's baby to term kills you.\" *All* her friends early voted for Harris. \n\nI'm not sure if older folks realize how pissed off and politically active young women are now. The GOP took the mask off and flat out told millions of women \"You don't fucking matter one bit to us except for the pretty white ones, because we gotta get enough white babies to ensure we're not replaced.\" \n\nAnybody who thinks that young women are somehow oblivious to the 24/7 misogynistic and hateful rhetoric pumped out by the right-wing in this country has their head up their ass.",

         "The only ones holding back abortion rights and student loan forgiveness are Republicans.  Harris is simply pushing reproductive rights as a referendum to push Dem control of both the WH and Congress.  If she had that, yes, she absolutely would restore those rights (and it was a right before, so to say it was unconstitutional is not factual).  That and it would put the Democrats in a much better position to replace a SC slot with their own if one comes up.  And, as I said before, no one wanted abortion left to the states.  That's just an excuse Trump is pushing to women Republicans to temper the furor within his ranks for overturning Roe.\n\nAnd the Republicans don't do the same?  Look at their platforms.  Can't talk about the economy as a whole because it's improved, so they harp on inflation while ignoring that it was a global issue related to Covid.  They harp on immigration, which has never been a traditional first tier issue, but conveniently never mention the fact there's a sweeping bipartisan immigration bill in Congress waiting for them to sign.  They can't talk about infrastructure, so they talk about Israel and Ukraine.  They can't talk about healthcare or lowering prescription drugs, so they talk about Afghanistan.  They can't talk about job creation, so they talk about LGBTQ+ rights and boys on girls teams.  They can't talk about lower crime rates and instead complain that the data is corrupt.  They can't talk about the Covid response, so they discredit science.  They can't talk about manufacturing jobs and tech initiatives, so they discuss losing jobs to China and immigrants.  They can't really talk about the debt, so they talk about tax cuts (which overwhelmingly benefitted the very wealthy).  \n\nTrump talked about passing infrastructure legislation. He didn't get it done.  Biden did.  Trump couldn't figure out how to distribute Covid vaccines, and then left a federal emergency up to the states and his son-in-law.  Biden immediately took control and got it done.  Trump talked of repeal and replace of the AFA, but he couldn't repeal it and then had to admit Republicans had no actual replacement plan. The number of uninsured Americans reached record lows under Biden.  Trump promised to decrease prescription prices.  Biden ACTUALLY decreased a number of prescription drugs and became the first admintration to negotiate drug prices with Medicare.  Trump signed zero immigrations laws during his tenure.  Biden got 3/4 of Congress to accept the most sweeping bipartisan immigration bill in 30 years (and was killed not because it was a bad bill, but because it made Trump look bad...because, you know, Republicans care about immigration).  He wanted gun control, a staple of the Democratic platform and a wildly political topic, and still got a modest bill signed to law.  Biden got environmental provisions, always a Dem platform, into the Inflation Reduction Act. \n\nSo when you say that Democrats campaign on things that can't be fixed, I don't know what the hell you're talking about.  BTW when the last three Republican presidents blew up the economy, and then Democrats promised to fix it, what happened?  I'll wait here...\n\nI don't know if sweeping student loan forgiveness will ever be supported, but if the Dems get Congress and the WH, they will absolutely codify abortion rights (which is supported by an overwhelming majority of Americans).

His campaign is literally saying whatever he has to to get people to vote for him, true or not. None of it matters. He's not running to be president. He's running to be CEO of United States of America, Inc. Until the hostile corporate takeover when they 25th him and install Peter Thiel, I mean J.D. Vance.",

         "Many very many have spoken on those low percent cases in which it is for a health risk, incest, rape. You are right the media is very polarized and that can be confusing (which is not a dig at you the polarized, two sided, tribalist nature of media is confusing for most if not all of us) giving the right to the states keeps something that is so case by case from having a blanket statement across it. If it was 100% banned that would caused issues but it if was 100% open that causes it\u2019s own issues this is quite literally a dammed if you do and and damned if you don\u2019t situation.

You\u2019re switching it. \n\nYou made it seem like illegals are killing women more than the abortion laws. I am saying that illegals killing women is fear mongering and they are much more likely to deal with the abortion issue killing them. \n\nNobody said it\u2019s ok for illegals to murder people, that\u2019s some straw man argument there. \n\nAnd your whole illegals voting rant is nonsense.

Am I wrong for saying this happened?\n\nSo do you also believe that States have the individual right to reject parts of the Constitution that don't align with their \"local values\"?\n\nYour stance on that state has the right to choose to restrict healthcare access based on religion, is aligning with those who want to regress society human rights. You're only proving my point. \n\nI see that we won't get anywhere here as you have made up your mind on this issue. go and vote if you disagree.\n\nI hope your guy loses.",
         "What manner of issues would arise from it being a 100% open choice? I lean towards it myself because it does seem to solve the \u2018what about exceptions like health/rape?\u2019 problem. With a blanket federal law permitting abortions, doctors traveling between states wouldn\u2019t have to check the local law (which may be very specific on its time limits and exceptions) before operations related to health/rape/miscarriage.\n\nIt may be a result of being exposed to polarized media sources, but I\u2019m not aware of any drawbacks. Trump did talk about.. people aborting babies after they\u2019re born\u2026? At the presidential debate? But that seems\u2026 very not correct.\n\nI would appreciate you going into the issues that would arise from it being 100% open choice.",

         "It\u2019s always trump isn\u2019t it. Even if trump signed off on it, it would have been a loss on him. Either way they trapped him in that. If he didn\u2019t vote for it they could blame open borders on him, so they had to make it to where he couldn\u2019t approve it, because it in fact would not have secured the borders. \n\nI love to use many different sources when researching politics. Starts with a google search, \u201cKamala Harris\u201d \u201cJoe Biden\u201d or \u201cDonald trump\u201d click news, I go through several different news stations, government websites, records, to verify anything I see. CNN has got to be the worst station I have ever seen, they twist words and blatantly lie with 0 consequences, hope mark robinson wins the case against them even if it\u2019s only 25k, it\u2019s the principle.\n\nI just wish more people could see that they\u2019re being manipulated by the Democratic Party. Independent research is important.\n\n\nEdit: damn sorry got locked in again and started ranting."

Influenza is considered the last \u201cmajor pandemic\u201d before Covid; and it didn\u2019t even hold a candle to Covid\u2019s worldwide outreach and the mass hysteria that followed as a response. It\u2019s also the first huge pandemic to happen after the uprise in smartphones and social media; combine that with the fact that all of this just so happen to line up with the next election; one which has an already established cult personality and extremist ideologies and the other bordering on dementia and total incompetence and you have recipe for disaster.\n\nThrough social media; people petaled the idea that Covid was a huge lie and scandal by the US government as an excuse to control the population. So in this time of crisis; where the government built by the people, for the people; what\u2019s to do its job and do what it SHOULD do, and HELP end the crisis by taking preventive measures and precautions; people take that as \u201cYOU DICTATORS AIN\u2019T TAKING MY RIGHTS AWAY\u201d. So this insane group of people thought they were gonna be revolutionaries and overthrow a tyrannical government when in reality; they were defying a perfectly reasonable government trying its best in a time of crisis. \n\nThen trump got more unhinged; his followers listened and you could write an entire book about how unhinged he is. Elon bought twitter, turned it into an algorithmic nightmare of anti- semitism, racism, anti-intellectualism and general xenophobia. \n\nWhile children get their minds rotted away by algorithms, so do fully grown adults; everyday, people just get more and more sucked into varying false realities and sludges of misinformation; hyper reality turning people more and more into what is effectively a caricature of the people they watch and listen to all day; like Trump, Tucker, Alex jones, etc. And the anti-intellectualism of these individuals trickles right back down to the viewers. \n\nMany People don\u2019t stop and think \u201cwait this guy is just being racist\u201d they subconsciously absorb and agree with these people like they are literal gods and keepers of all that is true and \u201cFighters against the lies that THEY don\u2019t want you to know\u201d whoever \u201cThey\u201d is. \n\nAnd it\u2019s not like you can just ignore these people either unfortunately because their actions have real consequences on all the reasonable folks in the US and likely similar effects around the world with different talking heads spouting equal or worse rhetoric. \n\nThe end result is a world full of people turning into entitled and radicalized zombies; most sense of former personality erased; \u201cnow exist to serve my conservative anti-vax, xenophobic overlords; must obey, must storm capital, must take guillotine, and bring it to capital, must obey orange man, must obey Tucker;\nAlex Jones is always right too\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, even folks outside of the politically obsessed become more unhinged by the day as well. People want to confirm their biases or feel entitled to certain things and so you have people that are like \u201cLadies, if your man doesn\u2019t buy you Starbucks everyday, he ain\u2019t worthy of you\u201d or incel groups of men that gather together and form a collective hatred of women.\n\nEffectively, we\u2019re just now in the part of the Information Age where we\u2019re seeing this radical shift in culture and how people perceive the world around them; for some it creates a positive difference; such as people realizing and coming together to say that it\u2019s okay to be gay/bi/trans, etc. to say that racism is bad, to say that \u201cTraditional values\u201d has become a dog whistle for hate and discrimination. \n\nMeanwhile, on the other end of the stick; you have people who say the exact opposite; that \u201ceveryone I don\u2019t like is bad\u201d that \u201call those WOKE people are weird\u201d, etc.\n\nThe end result; pure chaos!",

THe other side spent a lot on very successfully presenting him as a total failure, as a weak old man, and somehow the worst president we ever had as the best possible option. Kamala Harris was the deep exhale dems needed, and even in the first days clever analysts pointed out the unstoppable momentum of a deeply relieved electorate. Changes have clearly been made, a younger guard has been handed the reins of the DNC, and they absolutely smashed this out of the park - brilliant strategy, seizing on that need for change, and goddamnit Kamala Harris makes me feel like Obama did - smart, human, reassuring as hell, with a running mate who only stoked the fire.

They stopped using \"Were not going back\" and completely distanced themselves from the \"They're Weird\" messaging which I thought was a bad choice. I would have preferred for her to keep up that same direction and also more radically distance herself from Biden. She was too protective of him the entire campaign. \n\nMy guess is that at the DNC, the old guard came in and started advising her to run a campaign more like Bidens 2020 campaign which did not work as well for her.

Someone can correct me on this, but pre-Trump, it used to be that the primaries went up until almost the conventions, and then after the conventions was when the general election campaigning really started in earnest. So this, like, starting in the summer and going until November used to be pretty normal, I think.",

As such we didn't get to see much of her other than she endorsed Biden. In 2020 she was outshined by older politicians like Biden and Sanders (who were the final two and liked working with each other), didn't have the massive funds like Bloomberg, or even the familiar as a woman politician like Warren.\u00a0\n\n\nThis left her more or less a blank slate and most importantly time to improve and correct her mistakes in 2020.

Not because she was trying to fly under the radar, but because she was not even *on* the GOP's radar.\n\nThey truly see her as an inferior human, due to her race/gender, and would never have considered someone like her for a higher office.  So she was able to *define herself* when the time came.  The GOP hadn't spent decades attacking her, and when the GOP tried to define her (DEI hire, low-IQ, etc) none of it stuck because it was too late.\n\nThey never in a million years would have run a Kamala Harris so they assumed nobody else ever would, and left a huge blind spot open.",

Then when it was apparent Joe Biden was running, they went balls to the wall on Hunter Biden, and then Bidens age.",

She EMASCULATED him, shattered the macho alpha male facade that enabled more men to feel more comfortable supporting a woman.\n\nAlso: we do need to give credit to Hillary. Like Obama she was a trailblazer who planted the seed that having a female president was not only possible, but ultimately inevitable. And on that angle, the one thing about her I\u2019m so thankful for: she didn\u2019t highlight her gender as part of her campaign, glass-ceiling and what not.

Perfectly timed it so that the perfect balance between risk and reward could be executed and Kamala could get rocketed into the fight. He surprised his enemy in the oldest grand move in war, by leading a relatively docile Trump into an ambush and then calling in Captain Marvel and executing a pincer movement. Like as far as cinematic historical events go, Kamala\u2019s rapid assent to the forefront of the resistance against Trump is like Gandalf the White arriving on Helm\u2019s Deep or Han Solo blasting Darth Vader off course to let Luke blow up the Death Star. Biden is famous for his political mastery and bargaining- a lot of Obama\u2019s best successes in his tenure are owed in part to the amount of support and leverage afforded by Biden\u2019s strategies - and even with the pressure for him to resign, he outwitted Pelosi\u2019s own machinations to have an open election (not that she\u2019s complaining). Joe Biden is one of the most selfless and wise presidents in modern United States history. I truly hope he is one day recognized as such.",
         "Well I was one of those people. \n\nAnd to be fair, people just straight bailed on Biden and were shitty to him.\n\nI think what really sunk Biden was the 24/7 news coverage about him having to step down when Trump did the same and nothing was said about him. And the fact that every mistake, however small, was amplified x10. \n\nThen of course, on the other hand, we needed someone to meet the moment and be able to handle Trump. We needed someone that could, as Harris has done, spar and win against Trump during a debate.

They were able to spew bullshit the entire time, with Rogan listening intently. \n\nFor the Democrats though, who believe in facts and objective reality, they wouldn't be able to just sit there and let Rogan cite nonsense, therefore the interview is instantly gonna have a contentious vibe by comparison.

It didn't just show in his campaign and their desperate moves to rebound post-debate, it showed in his demeanor, his voice, everything he was doing told me, \"I *want* this. I want to keep being your President.\"\n\nThe very notion that this was somehow planned out from the beginning feels like Monday-Morning Quarterbacking to the nth degree. The entire Dem Party was preparing for the worst, for Biden to take his campaign all the way to election day, but instead he swallowed his pride and stepped down. Not only did he do it early enough that the party was able to then take the critical steps of solidifying behind Harris, but it was all still while he was probably still in his heart hurting from admitting that he was no longer up to the task of leading this country. I don't think anyone else in his position could have accepted it as graciously as he did.",

Women were at 80%, only eclipsed by 83% in 2020.\n\nLower enthusiasm gender, lower propensity the younger the voter\u2026 it was just an asinine move to try and get them to show up.",
         "I get that point, but mine is that the Dems could have run 5-6 different people in 2016 and Trump wouldn\u2019t have sniffed the white house, but they went with the one who was weakest for reasons that will live on in conspiracy theories.",

Usually it is the party with the most seats, but it can also be another party if you are in a minority parliament where no party has a clear majority. \n\nWe could see that next election if the Tories fail to get a majority, since their leader has been almost Trumpian in the way he taunts the NDP and the Bloc Quebecois. There could be a situation where the Liberals win 10 less seats than the Tories, but Trudeau doesn't lose confidence of the House, so just keeps on governing. Then again, he could lose confidence tomorrow and we could have an election, which is the best chance for the Poilievre Tories to get their majority.",

         "The easiest way is to do a national primary. Instead of spreading it out over the entire year,  you have everyone vote at once, no more than one month before the convention. Sure, candidates could campaign as early as they want, but it would largely keep the election season down to half a year or so, instead of already being started when the previous year's election is still going on.",
         "They could just not publish the results until the DNC, everyone tunes in to find out together who is the top vote getter across all states. This would also avoid the issue of states essentially determining the candidate because they have their primaries first.",
         "A \u201cDemocratic primary\u201d is one involving the Democratic party. You mean a \u201cdemocratic primary\u201d. \n\nAnd giving them up wouldn't be a big deal if we had a decent multiparty democratic system with proportional representation. Then party insiders would have to pick candidates with wide appeal or dwindle into insignificance. The US only needs massive public primaries because we are locked into the 2 Party System.",
         "Biden passing the baton on and Harris picking it up so seamlessly was a thing of beauty.\n\nIn terms of politics it will be studied as a massive lesson on professionalism and dedication on every level from Biden down to the average volunteer.\n\nFor such a smooth transition on such short notice for a presidential candidacy is definitely historic. It really reflects on the impressive character and ability of the administration and party in this moment.",
         "Yeah I disagree with the author who says she\u2019s not a transformative politician she absolutely is. She\u2019s the first Democrat I can remember who took the fight directly to the Republicans",
         "My respect has grown for Biden so much he really is a goat level politician. I wish he had won in 08 and Obama had been his vp and Obama won in 2016, things would be a lot better today I\u2019d bet",
         "I think this too, except I really would have expected him to bail prior to the debates if it was that pre-planned.\n\nMaybe the exit strategy was always in place, but the decision wasn't made until after the first debate.",
         "It's perplexing to me to hear people deny the possibility that this one was always a consideration and possible planned exit strategy for Biden.\n\nYet, everyone seems to agree so much of politics is a planned and orchestrated performance. There are literally whole teams for politicians that consider the public perception and best course of action. You think nobody in Biden's camp (the by extension the DNC) considered his age to be of concern and had a plan for if perception went against him?\n\nTotally agree he transitioned gracefully. I just think it was more planned than we have been led to believe.",
         "It is accurate. \n\n  \nI haven't listened to his podcast for a long time but he's always been up front about the fact that he's a dumb guy who just likes talking to interesting people. He has platformed some real pieces of shit out of ignorance but he also has actual experts on, or at least he used to, and he tends to be as blown away by them as he is by grifters. Hell, he was sold on the idea of UBI and universal healthcare at one point. \n\n  \nIf you put Pete across a table from him and gave him a blunt he'd be agreeing with everything he said inside half an hour.",
         "While I typed my initial message I actually thought about that. It is true that he has been campaigning on the very shallow and empty platform of Trudeau is evil for quite some time.",

         "I mean you\u2019re using logic. This Supreme Court passed Citizens United.",
         "Yea, I personally don\u2019t really buy it, but the argument of separating the states is to give people with less name recognition a chance to gain it.",
         "There will still be polling, people with talk about a front runner, the hate machine will spin up.\n\nThe whole point, supposedly, of have different states go at different times, (so I\u2019ve been told) is so that an unknown person could gain some recognition, so not publishing the results if them would be against the point of it.",
         "Yes, I did mean small \u201cd\u201d democratic. \n\nI agree having more parties would increase people feeling that they get more actual democratic choice, but plenty of parties will want to democratically choose their nominees. \n\nHaving more parties would also do a lot to neuter hate machines, what we were talking about, as well.",
         "Yeah her performance has actually made me optimism of her being a good president and I didn\u2019t think she was a good politician after 2020. My concern though is she\u2019s not going to go as far as needed to address the elephant in the room that being the powerful owning the government and the Republican Party fighting to destroy it. The times need a FDR or teddy Roosevelt and I\u2019m afraid she\u2019ll be more like Obama. Hopefully she recognizes it",
         "I\u2019m not convinced of the 4D chess thing, but the timing really was perfect if planned. Biden acted as a lightning rod for heat immediately after the first debate, baited Trump into complacency/false confidence to double down on extremist rhetoric (picking Vance, among other things) and then immediately squashing the assassination attempt coverage by shotgunning Harris.\n\nWay too psychological of a play to be intentional, in my opinion, but the ability of the Democrats here to be quick on their feet here was really impressive given their campaigning performances over the  past decade.",
         "Speaking of Alberta.  Reigning Trumpette Marlaina Smith as actively campaigning against Nenshi running pretty constant ads and sms campaigns.  \n  \nOr next provincial election is in 2027",

         "Yeah; wasn\u2019t something like $1bn spent on political advertising *last weekend*?  I mean, nice work if you can get it, but really\u2026",
         "It's absolutely more expensive to do a national campaign all at once than a state by state campaign, and that does mean a national primary favors the more well-known and richer candidates. But the solution to that is to have primary campaigns be party funded. Let them win on their message, not on how much money they have.",
         "Then if you manage to avoid the comments, you go to Thanksgiving dinner and your dispshit uncle is spouting off the nonsense he's had shoveled into his gullet by Fox News. If you want to have an informed response you're right back where we've been.",
         "So you\u2019re gonna forbid private funding campaigns\u2026?\n\nHow?\n\nWouldn\u2019t that be a pretty serious 1st amendment issue?",
         "Agreed. Politics have become so entrenched in every day life it\u2019s inescapable. The national anthem became politicized when NFL players knelt, COVID as a public health threat became politicized, gas prices are politicized whether they go up or down, entertainment media has became politicized by people that think it\u2019s part of a larger agenda (movies are \u201cwoke\u201d, etc). The amount of division between people has become so large some people view everything through a political lens. \n\nShort of avoiding people with conflicting views entirely which means trimming down your friend and family group by half so you exist in an echo chamber (a problem of its own), politics are inescapable. The larger issue is that politics cannot be discussed civilly anymore because a large portion of the population defaults to extreme hostility. There is a significant portion of the population that lives in an alternate reality.",
         "There is no 1st amendment issue because this is for a primary. As much as the two major parties would like to make you think otherwise, they are private organizations, not part of the government. And the first amendment only restricts the government. \n\nIf a political party wanted to say that a candidate for their party's nomination can only use the funding provided to them by the party, they are absolutely allowed to do so. They couldn't actually stop them from using their own money, but they could absolutely disqualify them for doing so, which would have the same effect."

         "I don't believe this. Not even a little. Not even a tiny little bit.\n\nIf he loses, he'll announce another re-election bid before the end of 2025. He'll pitch a fit, stomp his feet claiming fraud, and then he'll start holding rallies again.\n\nIf he wins, he'll start pushing for the end of term limits and start campaigning on that.\n\nHe's addicted to the cheers and adulations he gets from the rallies. Plus campaigning serves him 2 purposes 1) It helps to keep him out of jail, since he can make the argument that it's all political persecution. It won't save him forever, but it does help 2) Fundraising for his endless campaigns is about the only income he has these days.\n\nNow, that's not to say it'll be a successful campaign. I don't think he can win the nomination if he's a 3 time popular vote and 2 time electoral vote loser, but that won't stop him from trying. He's going to campaign until he's dead, and it won't matter if he's in the White House or the Big House.\n\nEditing to add: My tin foil conspiracy theory that I also believe is that he is a Russian asset and as long as he can cause disruption and chaos in the American electoral process, Putin will never let him walk away.",

Just ask anyone who works in retail about the mind boggling stupidity they see day in and day out.\n\nWith the heat waves due to climate change, the natural disasters, and droughts a competent center left population would be screaming for major changes to be made. Instead, gasoline going up ten cents causes far more outcry. The effects on the beef industry on the climate and our health (not to mention treatment of animals) in a competent, center left population basically have the beef industry irrelevant. Instead, people fume when their ribeyes are more expensive.\n\nI'd argue Kamala ran an AMAZING campaign, but consumption-obsessed-car-dependent-me-before-others Americans are just so brainwashed that the mere idea of what progress actually entails makes them recoil.",

I will say these are left leaning, but most of them are independent voters themselves. Over the years I've grown to like the way they present things and fact check both sides and offer credit where it's due. I honestly would like to find some that are right leaning/center just to have more of a variety, but everything I've seen so far i just don't agree with. Either because they are giving people that spout bullshit a platform, they cherry pick things to cover, and or they have a toxic audience.

The Dems\u2019 leadership treated her as a sort of heir apparent the moment she was elected in NY without any thought to the fact that she carried a ton of baggage and acted like she was a complete shoe-in for the office when it came time. I mean, look at \u201808 and how people went hard for Obama\u2014a relative new-comer\u2014over and against her. But the Dems consistently ignored this and kept pushing her. Was she a better choice than Trump? Absolutely. But she was a divisive figure and I knew several Democrats who didn\u2019t like her and were not willing to go out and vote for her (plus, they also thought Trump was a joke and would never win). \n\nBut Kamala feels different. It\u2019s the closest to Obama back in \u201808. It\u2019s not just \u201canti-Trump\u201d but actual excitement over her as a candidate. Plus, now people know what a Trump presidency would be. If Joe Biden of all people could win in 2020, I feel pretty hopeful about Kamala. People are actually voting *for* her, not just in opposition to the GOP. And that\u2019s great and even exciting. \n\nBut this only happens if people vote. You\u2019ve got a few hours. Make it so!",

On top of that, there are decent arguments for \"shy voters\" on both sides.\n\nSo in that universe, how on earth do you model \"likely voters\" with any confidence whatsoever?

Noncommited Puerto Ricans seem to be moving to Harris due to the garbage comments while a whole lot of committed Jews seem completely unmoved by what sounds like a threat). \n\ncomitted Trump voters believe that Trump will solve their grievances. They hang on the words he says that support their hopes and laugh at any words which scare/enrage \u201cthe libs.\u201d  Therefore, at least among the comitted, there really isn\u2019t much he could say that would convince them he isn\u2019t their working class billionaire hero. \n\nOf course neither theory really mater now that we are in the end game.

It was impossible to predict just how chaotic and terrible his presidency would be simply because we\u2019d never seen anything like it before. \u201cDuring a pandemic he helped exacerbate, the president will deny the results of an election and order his supporters to storm the Capitol\u201d would have sounded like bad thriller fiction in 2016.\n\nIn contrast, Clinton (who I voted for) was an incredibly well-known quantity, and a lot of people genuinely disliked her, in large part because the GOP had been demonizing her for literally decades. She may have been the most uniquely qualified person to hold the job of President in my lifetime, but she was a poor candidate/campaigner and took a lot of things for granted. Plus she was kind of the ultimate establishment figure, which can be (and was) a turnoff for certain voters, a fact which was made all the worse by Trump\u2019s outsider status.\n\nHarris has made none of the mistakes Clinton did- she\u2019s been campaigning her ass off- and is not nearly so well-known and long-tenured a national political figure as to be instinctively disliked by undecideds or people who are wary of \u201cthe establishment.\u201d And she is running against a version of Trump whose outsider appeal is gone, and who is in fact now all-too-familiar to many voters- he was a terrible President just four years ago, and has been an exhausting drain on the nation\u2019s psyche in the four years since.\n\nI share your concerns, I really do, and maybe I\u2019m saying all this to reassure myself as anything else.

In 2020 Biden won the popular vote by over 7m votes. I would argue that Hillary was a much less popular confidante than Kamala has turned out to be. \n\nThat was before J6 and before Trump doubled down on all the same, and in many cases, worse rhetoric that made the gap between 2016 and 2020 so large. I would be very surprised if Kamala doesn\u2019t have Trump beat by well over 10m votes, if not 15m or 20m. \n\nThe 2022 elections proved that Donald Trump was losing voters.",

He is, and always has been, the person he is now (okay, he's probably somewhat worse now with the dementia he's been falling into, but he started off an unadulterated sociopathic narcissist), and it was utterly predictable that such a depraved man would be such a terrible president.

I didn't think he'd be that bad a President because I thought there wasn't a chance in hell it would actually happen.\n\nWhich was part of the problem too.

It's a good watch and it's hard to come away from it with the impression that anything less than prison would be a suitable outcome for a guy who treats witness tampering as a personal right. This is not something that happened once or twice, the guy has a hit team of professional witness intimidators who are proud of what they do. Every one of those fuckers should be doing time.\n\nWhat you are reminded of in that documentary is that many of these goons have already plead guilty. It makes it hard to pretend nothing happend when most of your former lawyers have plead guilty to criminal charges. In several instances, these sociopaths are proud of themselves and seem to attach their identities to their role as Trump enforcers. That's cult-like behavior and those people are a danger to themselves and those around them. \n\nJohn Eastman. . . well watch the video and find out who that is if the name does not ring a bell.

That said,  ultimately, I think that the votes that are successfully cast in Texas will be counted correctly.  I think the reason that they do this isn't to actually fuck with the votes.  It's to make you worry that they will and reduce your trust in the system.  \n\nBecause then it make more people open to the idea of making it harder to vote - and that allows them more ways to control HOW you are able to cast your vote and who they'll allow to do it.",

Harris County mail-in ballots that they wanted to send out were 2.5 million, those were all illegal and we were able to stop every one of them,\" Paxton told former Trump adviser Steve Bannon during the latter's War Room podcast on Friday.\n\n> \"Had we not done that, we would have been in the very same situation\u2014we would've been on Election Day, I was watching on election night and I knew, when I saw what was happening in these other states, that that would've been Texas. We would've been in the same boat.

         "This is more on the Founding Fathers than the current DOJ. States can effectively do whatever they want with elections. If it is not against their State consitution they can literally throw out the vote and just send whatever electors they want.\n\nNone have (recently) because it is too obvious, but I would not be surprised to see efforts to that effect this year.

(Such a vote by their state legislature.)\n\nThe limitations are also largely based on interpretations of the Equal Protections clause of the 14th, which means that they are largely up to the discretion of whichever Supreme Court exists at the time.",

Quotes from back then where trump bragged about how they share a love of beautiful young women. He was found liable for sexual assault. Years of stories about how he'd enter dressing rooms at his beauty pageants with underaged women. The \"grab em by the pussy' tape. He cheated on his pregnant wife with a pornstar. \n\nHe is so thoroughly immoral I'm not sure that aspect would even move the needle.",

         "It's crazy they never even defend Trump, they just say everything is fake. It honestly just makes Trump look more guilty, and that lots of the GOP literally wouldn't care if he is a child sex predator they would still devote their life to serving trump.",

Thanks all you jerkoffs who\u2019ve made me so cynical that I now doubt anyone I hold in high regard. \n\n\n\nMy opinion would still be the same - anyone who harms a minor should be locked away in a solitary dungeon with little to no human interaction. No matter who it is or how beloved they were - zero tolerance.",
