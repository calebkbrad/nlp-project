And she absolutely wrecked Trump in the debate. She made very few mistakes. Her team has been very professional and competent. And she's upped her game quite a bit as a candidate.\n\nPeople forget. Biden was the candidate up until late July. I can't imagine trying to put together a billion+ dollar campaign in basically 30 days. But she did it.

Mostly they laugh at him, but they also know how stupid, demented, and fascist he is, and the untold damage he could inflict in the US and on the rest of the world. This is not only a US issue, it is a *planet-affecting* matter.\n\n\nWhen a Democrat is in office, the US is afforded respect -- especially in the case of Obama, a highly intelligent, compassionate, well-spoken President.

         "So glad of course for the outpouring of voting.\n\nI just wish people weren\u2019t so disconnected or complacent in the first place to ever allow Trump to be president, hijack the Supreme Court, and overturn Roe. \n\nFixing a problem is great but it also didn\u2019t need to even happen. \n\nI just wish Americans voted often for stability and peace or the society they want to maintain instead of retroactively after the shit hits the fan.\n\nMaybe we\u2019ll be more progressive moving forward. Who knows.",
         "If true, then it\u2019s over for Trump. Women have out voted men by 10+ points in early voting and as of last night 82 million have already voted with that gender gap on turnout. That means 51 million of those 82 million early votes are for Harris which cannot be overcome today assuming this late poll is correct.",
         "How many last minute polls are goona come out with Harris having a stunningly large gain? Nothing happened in the last week or two outside of Trump being fine with Puerto Rico being called garbage. Somehow I don\u2019t think that plays heavily on the minds of the average Iowan voter.\n\nStarting to feel like those pill suppression stories were true. Suppose we will find out tonight.",

         "Wait. This is Newsweek\u2026. It it credible?\n\nI want to believe!",
         "For America I think one of the most important questions is: Who looks more presidential? And I must say deteriorated quite a bit in the last weeks. While Harris looks like a typical president in one of those melodramatic natural disaster movies.",
         "I will finally up vote pro-Kamala poll articles, since it's too late to give people that false sense of security that would make them not vote.\n\nFUCKDJT",

         "The polls have been astounding this cycle. Always COMPLETELY TIED at the national or swing state levels (even though that\u2019s statistically impossible that all polls with fairly wide MOE find the exact same result) but dive into the segments and there\u2019s always been a very clear picture.",
         "I find it strange that all the betting odds around at the major betting places have trump as a favourite to win. \n\nMaybe that\u2019s just because his supporters are heavy gamblers.",

         "Time will tell",
         "What time do results start coming in? I mean if so many people voted early they should have some numbers already right? Or are they not allowed to say anything until polls closed in case people are swayed somehow? I don\u2019t get it. I feel we should already have a decent idea with actual numbers instead of handpicked \u201cpolls\u201d that are about as accurate as a statistic you make up to prove a point",

         "I just can\u2019t imagine that over half of men don\u2019t have women or queer people they give a shit about in their life, or lack the empathy to help strangers. As a man this is so sad to me, but I\u2019m happy to see the gap is closing at least. Progress starts somewhere",
         "How is he leading in any demographic?\n\nIt\u2019s insane that any sane person would even consider voting for him.\n\nRemember when that one dude who screamed kind of funny during his campaign years ago lost his campaign right then and there?",

         "I had a dream that Harris won and Trump just went MIA, news agencies everywhere reporting \"Harris won, but where's Trump??\"... presumably fled the country.\n\nI wonder how possible that might to happening be in reality.",
         "Jfc\u2026 If this and the Iowa poll and the turnout for women all holds true then it\u2019s gonna be an \u201808 level outcome for Harris.",
         "Wives were ready with divorce papers if their husband voted for Trump.",
         "Trump is going all in on young men who historically dont vote at scale. \n\nWouldn\u2019t be surprised if half the Rogan/tate bros polling for Donald aren\u2019t even registered.",

         "If this is true wouldn\u2019t that mean like a 15%+ blowout when women are included?",
         "You know what would be fucking hilarious? If Trump were given a prison sentence, and all of a sudden every conservative from Sean Hannity to Ted Cruz to Trump himself are asking President Harris to pardon him.",

         "Don't get complacent, don't let others get complacent that's what happened to us in 2016.... VOTE!",
         "That's an insane drop though. From 16 points to 4 points? Goddamn Trump is fucked.",

         "why does it say he\u2019s narrowing the gap with women tho in the same article",
         "Brutal for Trump if true, his entire electoral strategy was make a play for uneducated white men working blue collar jobs",
         "I don\u2019t even care if Trump goes to prison at this point. \u00a0I just need to know America is good enough collectively to send this orange clown back to Mar a Lago for good. \u00a0\n\nI need to know my country that I love is better than Trump.\u00a0",
         "...and:\n\n> The former president has, however, narrowed Harris's lead among women, from 18 points in the October 3 poll to 11 points in the latest one.\n\nSo +7 Harris, except more than that because women vote more than men anyway, consistently.\n\nIf this is real it's GGs for Trump.",
         "Neither Trump nor any US president is ever going to prison.",
         "I think when it\u2019s all said and done, the popular vote will be somewhere between 60/40 - 70/30 in favor of Harris.\n\nEveryone\u2019s been ignoring the fact that this is the first woman person of color, I do think she will be able to unite America in a way that few have done before.",
         "Damn that\u2019s big",
         "That would be huge! I have to admit I don't see that playing out at least in my life and circles, but that would be amazing!",
         "They're really ought to be safeguards in place to prevent Trump from escaping the country. I hope that his secret service detail has strict instructions to ensure that he stays so that he can face justice.",
         "The same poll also showed a 8% drop in Harris\u2019 lead with women. Let\u2019s not count chickens yet.",
         "So she\u2019s winning in the following demographics, women voters, young voters, elderly women voters, Latino voters, black voters, Asian voters, and is only behind men by 4 points. There\u2019s no chance this election is as close as they say.",
         "It\u2019s TRULY the only demographic that he has a lead on.\n\nIf he loses even a few then his chances are insanely small",
         "I literally exclaimed \"wow\" after. Honestly I'm shook, as a man voting for Kamala I feel severely in the minority. To know more men have woke up and said \"damn my wife/sister/girlfriend/mother could be in trouble with Trump in office\" is a huge positive step for Kamala. I'm hopeful!",
         "These are the Democrats you\u2019re talking about. If they win they\u2019ll want us to \u201cheal\u201d and \u201cmove on,\u201d there definitely won\u2019t be any consequences",

         "He'll try another insurrection before he picks up a new set of diapers. Don't rule out congressional fuckery this week. MAGA is going to try to go out loud. He's trained these idiots to not believe their eyes.",

         "the winner of the gender gap has won every election this century and maybe even the ones before, not sure, but this is huge",
         "Funny how you chose to leave out the part where Harris\u2019s lead for women voters was slashed as well. Constant propaganda, pick and choose whatever pushes your agenda and mindset.",
         "Who cares.  The polls are not reliable.",
         "I swear, I am not trying to perform some major copium here. Because I'm about to argue that I believe in narrowing gap for men, but I don't buy the loss of support for women in the exact same poll. This poll was completed between 10/31 and 11/02 and Trump has gone full on sexist these past few days. This poll will not reflect that.\n\nI firmly believe Trump has managed to piss off a shitton of men while also pissing off a shitton of women. This guy is going to be slapped silly in this election. It's really gonna be a landslide....ohhh sorry...it's going to be the closest election in history, wink wink",
         "Well, I\u2019d like the reasoning for Trump picking up female support. Like what?",
         "Assuming these final polls end up more correct than the ones from a few weeks ago it'll be interesting to see if this is mora a case of the undecided voters voting hard for Kamala or pollsters making inaccurate assumptions.",
         "Turns out, some men actually care about their mothers/wives/daughters/women in general and dont think of them as incubators and child rear-ers., but as people deserving of bodily autonomy and respect.",

         "How does this compare to how the male vote backed Trump/Biden in 2020?",

         "I\u2019m a white male brought up in a conservative family in a conservative town. You couldn\u2019t pay me to vote for that orange piece of shit.",
         "Wasn't that Trump's only remaining reliable demographic? I read the other day that swing state seniors were breaking for Harris, we know women and black voters are going for her in a landslide, presumably Puerto Ricans and Latinos are as well given his rhetoric and the youth vote as a whole leans heavily democratic.",

         "This. The conventional wisdom is that women are going to fight back because of losing their rights, and I've seen nothing to indicate that's not true. But as a man, I kinda expected men to fight back more. I almost can understand a woman voting for Trump if there are other things they like about Trump. \n\n\nIt makes more sense to me for someone to say \"this impacts me personally, and I'm going to vote for him anyway because I think these other things are more important, so I'm going to do what I think is right even though I'm putting myself at risk.\" That's proverbially putting your money where your mouth is.\n\nWhat's been harder for me to grasp is the men who say \"I don't give a single fuck about women's rights because I won't ever suffer, therefore I'm just gonna vote for things I want because I don't care about anyone else.\" It just doesn't seem like a very manly thing to do.\n\n\nMaybe it's a generational thing. Maybe this new generation of men who made a whole category to feel sorry for themselves called \"incel\" don't actually understand manhood. Maybe the generation that grew up looking up to pussies like Andrew Tate have no idea that manhood isn't about some bogus \"alpha\" facade, it's about putting your head down and handling your business.",

         "Even if I had none of those things I'd still think he's a terrible choice. He's not got a single legitimate strategy to improve people's lives and he's probably the weakest person to sit behind the Resolute Desk in the past 200 years.

Most of his supporters have jobs and lives that will be destroyed if they end up in jail for months to years.  \n\nOur election are bureaucratic AF, specifically because of how people have tried to cheat in the past.  Trump doesn't have any power over state or federal law enforcement or officials to try and derail the process.  The processes will grind away until a new president is sworn in, just like last time.",

         "I can't find any verification of that, but taking your word for it, the \"allowing the fist pump\" thing happened fairly recently so to some degree I believe my point still stands. If they were not invested in giving him a photo op, he would have been completely shielded from sight after that event.",
         "I have lots of friends/family in the airline industry.  Despite being major beneficiaries of collective bargaining, many pilots are also ex-military, lean older, and predominantly white.  Add in marinating their brains for years in Fox News, and it's not difficult to imagine Trump being able to find some MAGA faithful pilots.  \n\nAfter all, Trump has gotten more than a few otherwise successful attorneys and public officials to destroy their own lives over his lies.  What's one escaping \"persecution\" trip if you get the promise of a stack of cash and being a \"patriot\".  He'll renege of course and they'll lose their licenses but not that difficult in the grand scheme of things.",
         "I\u2019m not advocating that anyone *let* him, but as far as I know Secret Service protection is offered to all former presidents but it isn\u2019t mandatory, so he can easily dismiss his guards.\n\nAnd unless he\u2019s literally a wanted man with a warrant, the secret service won\u2019t arrest him or stop him from flying. Hell, Trump can just lie and file a flight plan to go somewhere in America and then just abscond and go to Russia\u2026 it\u2019s not like the US is going to shoot down his plane.",
         "I feel an obligation not to impose myself on others, whether I personally agree with them, understand them, or even know anyone pertaining to the group being affected. It's really that simple for me.\n\nA woman's decision over her body? Not my place to have a voice. An adult's decision to marry another consenting adult? Not my place to have a voice. What someone wants to do to their own body to feel more comfortable with themselves? Not my place to have a voice.\n\nAnd you know what? It makes my life a hell of a lot easier. I'm already overwhelmed by life, the last thing I need is more bullshit to deal with.",
         "The FBI wont do shit if he wants to flee. If he leaves from Florida everyone knows Desantis will block extradition. \n\nFlorida will protect him way more than Russia will.",
         "Not having a passport doesn\u2019t stop him from boarding his own private jet and telling the pilots to fly him overseas. If Russia wants him then not having a passport wouldn\u2019t stop them from admitting him either.",
         "I hate that it works this way, but no judge wants the optics of being the first to jail a former president and current presidential nominee for a major party right before the election. Most *legitimate* judges are going to bend over backwards to avoid appearing even the slightest bit political and let\u2019s face it there\u2019s no way to jail Trump right now without it looking political. They were always going to punt until after the election.",
         "Unfortunately, the USSS isn't exactly a beacon of protecting democracy at the moment.",
         "It is almost like a service of secret members of the government, right? Would be totally neat if we could instill something like that to just travel and protect him.",
         "Imagine you're a Secret Service agent and you have the choice to aid Trump in fleeing the country. This will get you a felony and you would have to give up your high -paying, respectable job to live in Russia. If you're lucky you don't end up in the front lines used as a meat shield.\n\nI don't see anyone going for that option.",
         "He was literally being dragged bodily off the stage by the USSS and threw his hand in the air. They didn't all stand back and let him do it. Try moving a 300+ lb giant sack of wet garbage like that in one direction while it's actively trying to get a photo op. It's not easy. Especially with cameras shooting from every single direction. At least one was guaranteed to get a \"good\" photo.",

         "In 2016, the New York Times published a very detailed precinct-by-precinct online map of the vote totals in NYC.\n\nMost of it was very blue, as expected.  There were a few red pockets that didn't surprise me.  The vast majority of Staten Island went for Trump, which wasn't surprising because Staten Island has been a Republican stronghold for decades, for some convoluted set of reasons.  \n\nAnother unsurprisingly red chunk of the map was a neighborhood called Breezy Point, at the far western end of the Rockaway peninsula.  That neighborhood is literally a gated community on a private beach.  In NYC.  It's clearly the kind of absolutely insane wealth where people's main concern is \"When I die, I need to leave my yachts to my children, without them having to pay taxes on it.\"  So, no surprise there either.\n\nThere were however 2 other little red pockets within the city that made me scratch my head, and dig deeper to figure out \"What's going on there?\"\n\nOne pocket was Brighton Beach, just a little east of Coney Island.   I'd been Coney Island a handful of times.  I'd walked along the beach down to Brighton Beach from Coney Island.  That whole area always seemed like Mets-fan-working-class-NYC to me. It made no sense that Brighton Beach would be Republican.  But... I learned, that Brighton Beach is also known as \"Little Russia.\"  Not the explanation I was expecting to find, but certainly a clear explanation, of why that neighborhood would break for Trump.\n\nAnother red area that surprised me was a neighborhood called Middle Village, smack dab in the middle of Queens.  I had no experience with this area, and thusly didn't have any preconceived notions of how / why it would vote this way or that.  After a bit of googling though, I found out that back in the 70s and 80s, when NYC was genuinely a rough place... when Times Square was more like a red light district, than Disneyland... back when crime (both petty and violent) was genuinely out of control... The one safe neighborhood in the whole city was Middle Village.  Why?   Cause that's where all mafia top brass lived.  Every two-bit mugger and car thief and tweaked out addict knew not to fuck with anyone in that neighborhood, because the mob would find you, and respond 10-fold.\n\nSo... that's who voted for Trump in NYC, in 2016.   Russians, and the mob.  (And Staten Island and the insanely wealthy of Breezy Point).  The rest of the city knows him as the shitty grifter that he is.\n\nEdit: Some words and some grammar.\n\nEdit 2:  Apparently I made so very wrong assumptions about the demographics of Breezy Point.  Turns out it's not a super wealthy neighborhood (despite being a gated community on a private beach).  Apologies.",

To them, as long as it's clear that they, a white person, control the interaction and the Black person will do what they're told, the racist is generally cordial. \n\nTo your actual point, it depends on how closeted their racism is. Where I grew up, there was a lot of racism, but it mostly happened outside of actual interactions with Black people. They'd bitch and moan about the Black person to their own family and friends, but in public they were civil. Some wouldn't acknowledge a Black person existed until circumstances called for it. Some wouldn't shake a Black person's hand or make any physical contact with them. If they had Black neighbors, they'd either eventually decide that they're some of the *good ones* or blame them for everything that goes wrong with their house/neighborhood and call the police on them for any minor thing. \n\n*Most* ^([citation needed]) racists I know just want Black people to stay *over there* and to *know their place* but it's never backed up with anything besides whining at home or with their friends. \n\nSince Trump has made it more socially acceptable to be racist in public, there's been a lot more overt racist things, like refusing to move out of the way on the sidewalk, spitting behind their backs, and generally loudly voicing complaints about \"those people\" when Black people are around. \n\nI haven't seen a resurgence of burning crosses or throwing bricks through windows, but if Trump ends up as president, I'd expect those events to follow.",

But, it's impossible to argue that her influence didn't help Biden win in 2020, which is why I was so critical of her for not endorsing Harris earlier in the race. She had already set a precedent by endorsing Biden in 2020, and to top it off, Trump was blatantly lying about her endorsement and posting fake AI images of her. Her reluctance to take a stance in the face of all of that was disappointing and frustrating.\n\nAll of that being said, I still appreciated how important it was for her fanbase to mobilize in this election in the same way it did in 2020, so I was relieved and grateful of her finally announcing her endorsement of Harris. Every vote matters so better late than never.\n\nBut now, today, on Election Day, when the final push is needed as much as possible and people need to be mobilized to finally, actually vote for ***Harris***, the candidate Taylor very publicly endorsed...all she can muster up is a single throwaway line about a reminder to vote? You already endorsed Harris! What could possibly be the motive to not highlight that?? Remind people of it! Remind them where their demi-god idol stands in this race! Make your Trump fans uncomfortable! Force them to reckon with their decisions! Shove it in their faces! Go big! Say it with your chest and let Brittany Mahomes hear it! If there were any \"damage\" to be done by endorsing Harris, it's already been done! What are you holding back for at this point??\n\nI just don't understand her logic with this election. A reminder to get out and vote is good, but it's so lukewarm and conspicuously non-partisan. Yes, as I mentioned, she did very publicly endorse Harris already, so who's to say another message about it on Election Day would move the needle much at this point. But it just feels so strange and unnecessary to...avoid it? It goes back to everything being so meticulously curated. Leaving out any mention of Harris/Walz is absolutely deliberate and it brings me back to that same feeling of disappointment and frustration. It all just feels directly contradictory to the curated persona of feminist ally, and it bothers me to see another powerful billionaire quietly hedge their bets at a time that demands principled stands.",

They've heard loud and clear that the GOP is the party of \"we don't care if carrying your rapist's baby to term kills you.\" *All* her friends early voted for Harris. \n\nI'm not sure if older folks realize how pissed off and politically active young women are now. The GOP took the mask off and flat out told millions of women \"You don't fucking matter one bit to us except for the pretty white ones, because we gotta get enough white babies to ensure we're not replaced.\" \n\nAnybody who thinks that young women are somehow oblivious to the 24/7 misogynistic and hateful rhetoric pumped out by the right-wing in this country has their head up their ass.",

         "The only ones holding back abortion rights and student loan forgiveness are Republicans.  Harris is simply pushing reproductive rights as a referendum to push Dem control of both the WH and Congress.  If she had that, yes, she absolutely would restore those rights (and it was a right before, so to say it was unconstitutional is not factual).  That and it would put the Democrats in a much better position to replace a SC slot with their own if one comes up.  And, as I said before, no one wanted abortion left to the states.  That's just an excuse Trump is pushing to women Republicans to temper the furor within his ranks for overturning Roe.\n\nAnd the Republicans don't do the same?  Look at their platforms.  Can't talk about the economy as a whole because it's improved, so they harp on inflation while ignoring that it was a global issue related to Covid.  They harp on immigration, which has never been a traditional first tier issue, but conveniently never mention the fact there's a sweeping bipartisan immigration bill in Congress waiting for them to sign.  They can't talk about infrastructure, so they talk about Israel and Ukraine.  They can't talk about healthcare or lowering prescription drugs, so they talk about Afghanistan.  They can't talk about job creation, so they talk about LGBTQ+ rights and boys on girls teams.  They can't talk about lower crime rates and instead complain that the data is corrupt.  They can't talk about the Covid response, so they discredit science.  They can't talk about manufacturing jobs and tech initiatives, so they discuss losing jobs to China and immigrants.  They can't really talk about the debt, so they talk about tax cuts (which overwhelmingly benefitted the very wealthy).  \n\nTrump talked about a passing infrastructure legislation. He didn't get it done.  Biden did.  Trump couldn't figure out how to distribute Covid vaccines, and then left a federal emergency up to the states and his son-in-law.  Biden immediately took control and got it done.  Trump talked of repeal and replace of the AFA, but he couldn't repeal it and then had to admit Republicans had no actual replacement plan. The number of uninsured Americans reached record lows under Biden.  Trump promised to decrease prescription prices.  Biden ACTUALLY decreased a number of prescription drugs and became the first admintration to negotiate drug prices with Medicare.  Trump signed zero immigrations laws during his tenure.  Biden got 3/4 of Congress to accept the most sweeping bipartisan immigration bill in 30 years (and was killed not because it was a bad bill, but because it made Trump look bad...because, you know, Republicans care about immigration).  He wanted gun control, a staple of the Democratic platform and a wildly political topic, and still got a modest bill signed to law.  Biden got environmental provisions, always a Dem platform, into the Inflation Reduction Act. \n\nSo when you say that Democrats campaign on things that can't be fixed, I don't know what the hell you're talking about.  BTW when the last three Republican presidents blew up the economy, and then Democrats promised to fix it, what happened?  I'll wait here...\n\nI don't know if sweeping student loan forgiveness will ever be supported, but if the Dems get Congress and the WH, they will absolutely codify abortion rights (which is supported by an overwhelming majority of Americans).   And states aren't forced when it's federal law.",

         "Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell acknowledged in a private meeting on Wednesday that Trump\u2019s animosity toward the yet-to-be-released border deal puts Republicans in a serious bind as they try to move forward on the already complex issue. For weeks, Republicans have been warning that Trump\u2019s opposition could blow up the bipartisan proposal, but the admission from McConnell was particularly striking, given he has been a chief advocate for a border-Ukraine package.\n\n  \n\n\nNow, Republicans on Capitol Hill are grappling with the reality that most in the GOP are loathe to do anything that is seen as potentially undermining the former president. And the prospects of a deal being scuttled before it has even been finalized has sparked tensions and confusion in the Senate GOP as they try to figure out if, and how, to proceed \u2013 even as McConnell made clear during party lunches Thursday that he remains firmly behind the effort to strike a deal, according to attendees.\n\n  \n\n\n\u201cI think the border is a very important issue for Donald Trump. And the fact that he would communicate to Republican senators and congresspeople that he doesn\u2019t want us to solve the border problem because he wants to blame Biden for it is \u2026 really appalling,\u201d said GOP Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, who has been an outspoken critic of Trump.\n\n  \n\n\nHe added, \u201cBut the reality is that, that we have a crisis at the border, the American people are suffering as a result of what\u2019s happening at the border.

Let me take credit for solving it later.\u2019\u201d\n\n  \n\n\nGOP Sen. Todd Young of Indiana called any efforts to disrupt the ongoing negotiations \u201ctragic\u201d and said: \u201cI hope no one is trying to take this away for campaign purposes.\u201d\n\n  \n\n\n\u201cI would encourage (chief Senate GOP negotiator) James Lankford and other conservatives to produce a work product with which they will shortly allow conservatives like myself to review it and take heart that there are a number of us who won\u2019t be looking to third parties and assessing the propriety of passing this bipartisan proposal,\u201d Young said\n\n  \n\n\n[https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/25/politics/gop-senators-angry-trump-immigration-deal/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/25/politics/gop-senators-angry-trump-immigration-deal/index.html)\n\n  \n\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Republican senators made it clear Tuesday that they will kill the border security bill their party negotiated with Democrats, a stunning turnaround less than 48 hours after it was released by Sen.

If he didn\u2019t vote for it they could blame open borders on him, so they had to make it to where he couldn\u2019t approve it, because it in fact would not have secured the borders. \n\nI love to use many different sources when researching politics.

CNN has got to be the worst station I have ever seen, they twist words and blatantly lie with 0 consequences, hope mark robinson wins the case against them even if it\u2019s only 25k, it\u2019s the principle.\n\nI just wish more people could see that they\u2019re being manipulated by the Democratic Party. Independent research is important.\n\n\nEdit: damn sorry got locked in again and started ranting."

So now it MIGHT be the case (based on some of these highly reputable polls showing completely different data) that those polls are heavily weighing their polls toward Trump so they aren\u2019t wrong again. Also, it\u2019s possible they just want clicks and/or don\u2019t want to be wrong so they say \u201coh it\u2019s a coin flip! 49/49 or 48/48 with 2% undecided!\u201d",
         "You can read about it on a lot of technical wonky/statistics blogs (meaning this isn't some super secret), but the short answer is that they don't know how to get Trump right in polls.\n\nThe basic fear is that they have overcorrected, because they were wrong in both 2016 and 2020 (Biden won but they had him winning by more than he did in 2020, for example). So, the idea is that they have now overcorrected for it and are weighing Trump voters more/too much. Now, they could have gotten the models right this time, but there are a few reasons that might not be the case:\n\n1. They aren't capturing some demographic that is behaving in a non-traditional manner (in 2016/2020 they weren't capturing the male white working class pissed off voters that broke for Trump). If Iowa is right, this time they might not be capturing pissed off white women correctly. This could be an across the board problem, but because Selzer does her polls in a pretty different way, her model is hard to replicate outside of Iowa (also note that Iowa just banned abortion, I think).\n2. It's unlikely that every state everywhere is statistically tied: again this would be connected to overcorrecting, but we should see a little more variation than we are seeing.\n3. There are weird things going on with down-ballot races. If you look at 538 and at a few polls you'll see it. In Nevada for example the Senate race is looking pretty good for Dems but Trump is up on the presidential ballot. That means that 4-8% (in some states), will have split votes heavily favoring a Dem in the Senate and Trump at the top. This just seems odd. It could be possible, but is odd.\n4. The big one: Nobody knows how to poll anymore. The under 45 crowd doesn't answer the phone. Apparently, even when Gen Z does answer the phone they lie or just say undecided when they aren't (this could go either way). People that never voted seem to be voting this year too.\n\nBut, all this tea leaf reading at this point. Just need to vote and see what happens. Anyone acting certain at this point isn't being honest.

Definitely not anyone in America's history, or most first world countries for that matter. The combination of circumstances that created his personality, created his career and image, and led to his election feels like some kind of black swan event.\n\nThis is why I don't get too upset at people being blindsided by his victory in 2016. How and why would you possibly prepare for a phenomenon like him?\n\nInternationally, I feel like he has a lot in common with Berlusconi. He was also (seen as) a successful businessman, political outsider, populist, brash, \"impolite\" etc. I don't know that much about his political career but I'm aware of those basics.\n\nYou also have populists like Bolsonaro, and rogue soft authoritarians like Netanyahu and Erdogan where you could draw some comparisons, but many differences too.\n\nIf I'm taking a long view, I personally think and hope that history will remember him as a bizarre blip more than anything. Sort of like how Spain was randomly a fascist dictatorship for like 40 years, but a democracy before and after. Or how Oliver Cromwell overthrew the monarchy but then it was reinstated after him.\n\nTl;dr my take is that W and Reagan are more representative of our political system, and Trump is more of a bizarro detour.",

Only three pickups this time, no hooting or hollering, and most of the flags just whining about the 2020 election they'd already lost.

They'll be like, \"Trump? Trump who? ***I*** never voted for the guy\" or something to that effect. \n\nThe usual GOP policies, however, will continue on after Trump. There are plenty of other people in various positions outside of Trump. You have the majority conservative Supreme Court, you still have plenty of shameless GOP senators/governors, and you still have The Federalist Society. \n\nI think the one way that the Republican party could \"collapse\" would be if one of the other currently existing \"Independent\" parties gained a massive surge in public membership/endorsement by traditional GOP members, put forth competitive candidates in state level elections, and put forward a competitive candidate in the election after Trump is a fuzzy memory.

A Trump vote in Massachusetts or a Harris vote in Oklahoma hold the same impact as a Chase Oliver or Cornel West in the majority of this country. \n\nThe main difference? \n\nVoting third party means that if a third party gets five percent, they get federal election funding. Meaning this two party system everyone bitches about but still bizarrely still want to protect (the vote blue no matter who or better red than dead crowds) would be a thing of the past. \n\nHowever, in my experience, most voters don't actually care about 'fixing the system' any more than voting for one of the two major parties, more often than not the Democratic party. \n\nWe can act upon the work that Fairvote does and advocate RCV too, but we much rather mindlessly go 'TEAM BLUE OR TEAM RED' instead. Neither the Republican or Democratic parties want RCV, though, because it would squash their holds on voting power in the US. Both parties want you to be compliant, pick a side, and just shut up. The true fact of the matter is that we have an 'illusion' of choice and that's all that it will be until real reform is done and we have parties and candidates that represent more than just the far right and whatever the democrats feel like running as that current cycle.",

The real power at the top, who are paying for and circulating the disingenuous and fake Republican polling over the past couple weeks are also fooling the political power brokers who think these fake(to use an easier word) polls are real.\n\nSo when a legit poll breaks through the propaganda screen and hits the idiots who are high on their own supply, of course it's going to shake them.\n\nIt's that whole reality thing piercing the propaganda network for the first time in years.",
         "That\u2019s why the Selzer Iowa poll is so seismic; it\u2019s not about Iowa itself, it\u2019s about everything around Iowa.\n\nIf that Iowa poll is accurate, Trump is well done cooked.",
         "Right, Iowa barely changes paths for Harris. I toyed around with the maps and the only thing winning Iowa opens up for her is if she loses Wisconsin, she would only need Nevada to win. (and as a bonus, it eliminates the Nebraska 2nd district risk, but that seems pretty safe)\n\nHard to justify dumping money into a high risk / low reward state when there are obviously more competitive, bigger prizes.",
         "> Insulting comment aside, if the Harris campaign thinks Iowa is close then they surely think bigger prizes are even closer.\n\nTHIS is the news from her poll. If Iowa actually goes close to what she said it means trump is unabashedly screwed in every swing state, and also has a very good chance of losing NC (if not more).\n\nI never saw this poll as \"okay maybe iowa is in play\". I always saw this as a canary in the coalmine.",
         "Oh no doubt, I don't blame her for ignoring Iowa. I thought us a lost cause anyways up until the polls started thinning a few weeks back. We definitely weren't worth the effort. \n\nTo see we're in play is nothing but a shock to me.",
         "Right. Same thing with all the \"why isn't she chasing blue Texas more? I feel it for real real this time!\" People \n\n\nAny reasonable universe where Texas goes blue she never needed Texas. So it just doesn't make a lot of sense to put any focus there.\n\nYou don't get to be super president if you hit 400 Evs.\n\nIf we're waiting for the last Houston precincts to come in to see if Texas flips we've all passed out 2 hours ago from the party that started 5 hours ago because she locked up 270  4 states ago.\n\nI think most people realize this is probably an outlier. But she can be 9 points off and this is still pretty damning for trump. Even that is still a 2 point shift leftward in the region that was blue the last time.",
         "I think he\u2019s referring to the fact that Iowa has been pretty firmly red since 2016 or so. We used to be purple, and hopefully we are moving that way again, but the Republicans clearly took for granted that the shift was permanent.\n\nSource: am Iowan.",

         "As an Ohioan, I sure hope you are right.",
         "I fear that is actually a reason that there will be less Republican women voting against Trump in those states.\n\nThose states have abortion rights protected. I think what you're seeing is in the states that have seen abortion rights taken away after Roe V Wade was overturned you are more likely to see a larger amount of Republican women (or right-leaning Independent women) oppose Trump.",

         "I wish I had your optimism.",
         "Exactly, I watched some clips of them melting down of women voting for Harris and how that\u2019s just as bad as *them* cheating not their husband cheating.  I don\u2019t know how any woman can vote for him or be a republican.  \n\nWho they vote for is their own business but they have shown disdain for women not just the ones in their party but for all women.   They wrapped their misogyny and bigotry in *Traditional Values* and people flock to it.  \n\nThe GOP is now in their *final form* that is a party of misogynistic, racist, homophobia dipped in some bro culture and incel vibes.  Yet they still don\u2019t get it that trying to strip away autonomy from women and preaching some bible verses is doing the exact opposite.",

         "I\u2019m a woman and my only coworker is a misogynist. I just don\u2019t understand this mentality in this day and age.

I mean, I\u2019m glad in my own way, please keep digging yourself deeper into a hole, but it\u2019s crazy how little their voting strategy makes sense. They won\u2019t suddenly gain any extra male voters this way but might lose more women each time. Crazy",
         "Except she was totally on point the last time. She showed him in 2020 winning the state by 7 points and he ended up by 8 points.\n\nThe actual thinkers in his team are probably very rattled as it suggests their internals are off and that it might be a systemic error so all their data could be off in all the states.",
         "That\u2019s my thought as well. Is it probably an outlier? Yeah. Will Kamala likely win Iowa? Nah. But if a quality poll finds that level of support for Harris in Iowa, it bodes well for Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, etc.",
         "> Trump is well done cooked.\n\nBeen looking forward to seeing trump's goose cooked since 1987!",

The fact that the Selzer poll looks like this and the Harris campaign spent **zero time in Iowa** also is beyond telling.",
         "It's not about Iowa.  It's about Iowa being a right leaning state that looks a lot like the rust belt blue wall states.\n\nIf Iowa goes blue, it's likely that WI/MI/PA all follow a similar pattern.",
         "I think he actually just means that it's cheap to buy airtime there, compared to other markets.",

         "Not only did you get that deer and a replacementID but you got that username?? \n\nWinner. I want to be you.",
         "Maybe, but Ohio tried to prosecute a woman for a miscarriage and literally came and took the blood and let\u2019s say remains out of her bathroom after she was turned away at the hospital and then ratted out by a nurse for the crime of\u2026 miscarrying. So if they read the news at all they\u2019ll be pretty damn pissed off.\u00a0",
         "But why vote to protect women's health care and then not come out to prevent trump from tearing it down? \n\nThe people who want to protect women's rights will need to come out every election until Republicans credibly drop their anti-woman crusade",

The thing is is he\u2019s already been president for four years and it was an unmitigated disaster. \n\nThat worked when he was running against a pretty unpopular candidate who bombed her own campaign with assistance from Comey.",
         "I mean, Vance just straight-up called Harris trash last night at his sad little rally. They're not even bothering to pretend they respect women any more.",

I also have this strangely odd belief that Trump doesn't give a shit about anything or anyone but himself, so if I care about all the peoples here knowing peace and prosperity Harris/Walz gives that a chance at least. Trump, well, lol.\n\nAnyway even if Trump takes Iowa, I just love that it is this close BECAUSE of *women*.\n\nTrump and the GOP have just done everything in their power to make live a literal living hell for women in America, and it would be pretty sweet to have a woman defeat them and a woman bring back some sanity to our healthcare for women and our reproductive rights and again democracy is pretty cool (as a Lebanese, I don't know democracy, but as an American I'll literally die first before I give it up. I've seen the other side of things, and this is not a life worth having. But a democratic system of institutions? Definitely worth dying for as our American ancestors proved, because by dying for it, they expanded the American dream, expanded the reach of our constitutional rights, and expanded our individual freedoms and protections. All things Trumpists want to absolutely annihilate).\n\nOk, I may have gone on a **bit** of a tangent lol. Sorry. I'm excited  for tonight but also scared because - warzone  and all lol.",

         "I live in Maryland so I have it pretty good in terms of voting access. The most difficult part of voting I have is we have two polling places basically across the street from each other (elementary school and senior center. I can literally see one from the other) and every year I forget which one I\u2019m supposed to go to. I usually guess wrong and have to spend a whole 5 extra minutes",

         "Jeez, I didn't know every American was getting in the same line and all waiting together to vote one at a time. Wow! \n\nPrecincts can be more numerous and smaller, which means that one polling place serves fewer people leading to shorter lines.

I was just watching a doc series on the Earp brothers and the Cowboys and newspapers back then wanted crazy and dramatic things to print. What else but that sells? At the same time, people are more able to see how incompetent Trump is thanks to social media. I think the election would be even closer without being able to blatantly see his fumbles.

He has got used to the idea that he can do whatever the hell he likes and he will never be held to account for it in any meaningful way.\n\nThe time has now come for all that to change. He needs to be locked up and taught that there are indeed consequences and he is absolutely not immune to them.\n\nApart from anything else a message has to be sent to kids growing up in this world that if you seriously misbehave - as Trump has done repeatedly - you will face serious consequences.",

He's oscillated between voting and not voting, but he just couldn't bring himself to not vote, and he couldn't bring himself to just leave the president blank.  Anyway, we talk politics all the time and I am a political junky so I follow this stuff very closely.  Even I can't keep track of this stuff.  My dad wishes he joined the military like forty years ago, and regrets it, and so he sort of transfers that to my service, for which he is proud.  I meant to bring up all the anti-veterans stuff the last time we talked, thinking that would be something that might gain some traction with him.

And every year under Obama, bar two, there were far fewer bombs dropped than every year under Trump.

Kamala Harris was the deep exhale dems needed, and even in the first days clever analysts pointed out the unstoppable momentum of a deeply relieved electorate. Changes have clearly been made, a younger guard has been handed the reins of the DNC, and they absolutely smashed this out of the park - brilliant strategy, seizing on that need for change, and goddamnit Kamala Harris makes me feel like Obama did - smart, human, reassuring as hell, with a running mate who only stoked the fire. It's not a miracle, it's a razor sharp strategy. I'm not celebrating, I'm scared as fuck and I hate it, but I have felt more optimism and hope in the last 90-something days than Ive felt since \\~2012. \n\nWe can only hope. The chaos is going to be infuriating. If the coup is successful, I as a gay man with guns have no idea what I'm going to do, but I know there will be bitter, frustrated tears. There's gonna be tears either way, I hope they're from the joy and pride of my country electing a nonwhite woman of character like we rarely see.",

Not because she was trying to fly under the radar, but because she was not even *on* the GOP's radar.\n\nThey truly see her as an inferior human, due to her race/gender, and would never have considered someone like her for a higher office.  So she was able to *define herself* when the time came.  The GOP hadn't spent decades attacking her, and when the GOP tried to define her (DEI hire, low-IQ, etc) none of it stuck because it was too late.\n\nThey never in a million years would have run a Kamala Harris so they assumed nobody else ever would, and left a huge blind spot open.",

We needed someone that could, as Harris has done, spar and win against Trump during a debate.

The entire Dem Party was preparing for the worst, for Biden to take his campaign all the way to election day, but instead he swallowed his pride and stepped down. Not only did he do it early enough that the party was able to then take the critical steps of solidifying behind Harris, but it was all still while he was probably still in his heart hurting from admitting that he was no longer up to the task of leading this country.

As much as the two major parties would like to make you think otherwise, they are private organizations, not part of the government.

They couldn't actually stop them from using their own money, but they could absolutely disqualify them for doing so, which would have the same effect."

         "I'm a Christian. My wife is an ordained pastor.  I spent the better part of 10 years working for 'the church' in a few different ways. I went to seminary (but didn't finish with COVID and a job change). \n\nConservative Christians buy into the 'war' imagery in the Bible. They are adversarial in nature and consider their faith journey to be one of adversity. Conservative Christian denominations are also the largest in the US - Evangelical Protestants being the bulk of them - making up roughly 25% of the US population. \n\nWe often look to folks like Joel Osteen, but the truly despicable central figures were people like Oral Roberts - who promoted the Prosperity Gospel. The PG basically morality is tied to wealth. God gives wealth to good people, so the wealthy must therefore be moral, while the poor must therefor be amoral. \n\nSo in the 80s and 90s when most of us were disgusted by fictional characters like Wall Street's Gordon Gekko - the people were quietly fetishizing having their own wealthy elite. \n\nThose of us in the real world recognize that no person can get that amount wealth without being highly unethical - think insider trading, ponzi schemes, etc. But because Conservatives equate wealth with morality, they see those failings as acceptable because they lead to a higher purpose - and if God gives you wealth, God must consider you to be okay. \n\nMeanwhile, the more liberal pockets of American Christians are busy feeding the poor, housing the homeless, etc. They see it as their mission to uplift their fellow humans and consider it important to live and play within the rules.\n\nOne of those rules (mostly unspoken) is that we don't discuss politics or religion in public. So these folks go to church, give to charity, do their thing, and go home. Quietly leading a life of faith as they see fit, without wanting to inadvertently impose it on anyone else. The most vocal and famous ever would be Jimmy Carter, and he got pretty beat down in the political spectrum after one term in the WH. But he played by the rules.\n\nAnd he of course lost to Ronald Reagan. A Christi-racist himself, RR was a big proponent of Prosperity Gospel and ingrained in deeply into the law of the land. There's a reason he's still the poster-boy of the Right. \n\nSo of course all of this to say, lots of Christians DO stand up to Trump. But we do it quietly, because that's the rule. You don't make a show of your religion, you don't make a show of your faith, you don't pick fights in public, etc.\n\nIt's obviously problematic and I would never argue otherwise, but this is why it is the way it is.",

If you really want to stop abortions (at least what I qualify as contraceptive abortions) you have to focus on the root cause.  Why are you wanting an abortion?  Did you have fun with someone and now regret the consequences of those actions?  What led you to believe you had to have that fun to begin with?\n\nBut to focus on those questions is harder to do than to just blindly oppose abortion and move to make ALL abortions illegal.  Being a Christian isn't always about taking the easy action - in fact it rarely is.\n\nI weep so much for what these Christian followers of Trump are doing to the Christian movement.  How can we as Christians look to bring people to Christ when we follow someone with the character and moral flaws of Trump?  Worst yet, how can we bring people to Christ when so many Christian Trump followers are imitating the very mannerisms of Trump?\n\nThe Bible teaches us that we will know Christians by their fruits:  Love, Joy, Peace, Longsuffering, Gentleness, Goodness, Faithfulness, Meekness, and Temperance (Galatians 5:22-23).  Which of these fruits does Trump - a man that says he doesn't need forgiveness because he's never done anything wrong - exhibit?  If you are a Christian, which of these fruits are you showing your fellow man?",
         "Why? MAGA is almost wholly a Christian fundamentalist/evangelical movement.  ~75% of that group support Trump. Christianity is a problem. So are other fundamentalist religions.",
         "It was defintely Lincoln!",
         "That is exactly why the GOP plays the anti abortion games.    This is to keep evangelicals voting GOP, because to vote not-GOP = baby murder = sin in their manipulated equation.   Disgraceful to use women\u2019s health as a tool to glean power for themselves.",
         "The problem is that the GOP doesn't care about life either.  \"Pro-life\" was always a lie.  It's a scam used to trick people who don't think too hard.\n\nRoe v. Wade was overturned, and there are MORE abortions now than there were when it was legal.  Is that what you wanted?  There have been hundreds of cases of women who had miscarriages, and instead of getting hospital care they get arrested for having abortions.  There have been women with non-viable pregnancies who died because the hospital can't treat them.\n\nHow do you pretend for five seconds that you care about life and vote to support the people who did all that?\n\nIf you're against abortion, there are lots of sensible things that could be done to reduce the number of abortions, starting with comprehensive sex education.  But the same people who say they are against abortions are also against actually teaching sex education to kids; they want to teach \"Abstinence-Only Education,\" which essentially means that they think the best thing is to keep children ignorant of their own bodies and how they work.\n\nYou know when you see people saying that Christians are immoral anti-science hypocrites?  Stuff like \"Abstinence-Only Education,\" voting for people who increase the number of abortions and get innocent women arrested and killed, and talking as if \"more abortions and more dead women\" is the only morally acceptable choice is WHY people say that.  Because it's true.\n\nIf you want people to stop saying it, stop making it true.",

There actually is a surprising amount of [commonality](https://www.benjaminlcorey.com/could-american-evangelicals-spot-the-antichrist-heres-the-biblical-predictions/) between Trump and the evangelical interpretation of *The* Antichrist, but he is at the very least *an* antichrist in Christian Theology.\n\nHe has supplanted Christ for Chritians and is acting as a false messiah leading the church down the path of destruction. I was a fundamentalist for most of my life, only breaking out after attending Bible College and realizing that the massive cognitive dissonance I was under (caused by science and social issues) could only be resolved by dropping my acceptance of inerrancy and sola scriptura, but I stayed in the church after that, just as a \"Liberal Christian.\"  \n\nThe fall to Trump is the reason I lost all faith in the church. It is not a \"well they are wrong about some stuff.\" Their behavior is a complete refutation of the entire saving grace of Jesus and the holy spirit.

Election organizers announce they're throwing a party and if you don't RSVP you can't go. If you have RSVP'd then when you go to vote you just say \"I'm on the list\" and don't necessarily have to show ID.

Bad-faith actors are running amok in the absence of a  confident American presence, hamstrung by this ludicrous election process. \n\nThe World has, for a long time, extended a respect to the US as a moral and even military arbiter. That respect is under enormous threat. Another Trump administration will end it, without question. The dollar will not survive as the global reserve currency.

Specifically the first one. So much talk about how the secret service wasn\u2019t prepared (and I\u2019m not saying they were) but for me the obvious thing was how all these institutions, regardless of resources are made up of regular old humans making low-middle class wages. \n\nObviously they\u2019re a different organization and can do a lot more planning for something like protecting specific buildings with more specific time tables, and monitoring large groups of communication is far easier than lone wolves. But i find it extremely hard to find comfort right now.",

         "Watch the videos of the first barrier that went down, the police were outnumbered 50 to 1. That is Rambo action movie fiction levels, you cannot hold such a mob back. And the reason they were so understaffed is because that's how Trump and his goons wanted it to be and took steps to ensure."

They can sane-wash the ramblings of Trump while playing small flubs from democrats on repeat, and vilify them in their opinion pieces, and there's nothing anyone can reasonably do against it.\n\nDominion and Smartmatic sued Fox News for defamation, and while the Smartmatic suit is ongoing, Fox News settled with Dominion out of court for almost 800 million dollars, and Tucker Carlson got fired in the process, so at least they've been proven not to be invincible.\n\nWithout Fox News as their primary source of (mis)information, conservative leaning people will no longer get a warped view of the world they live in. Fox News would be *required* to give them real news, and not hit pieces and opinion pieces masquerading as news stories. Buffoons like Jesse Waters and Sean Hannity should get reprimanded for misleading or outright false statements, and the network should be fined heavily for each deliberately false piece they air without proper fact checking.\n\nThe Fairness Doctrine that Reagan axed in the 80s (because of course it was Reagan, it's always Reagan), would ensure that Broadcast networks gave equal time to opposing viewpoints, but on the other hand, \"equal time\" is a bit of a double edged sword, because there is no point to have a NASA scientist and the local moon-landing-denier share equal air time simply because it is required. So I'm not sure the Fairness Doctrine is the right solution, but a new piece of legislation designed for more modern times would be a good idea to implement.\n\nApply it to all news networks equally, and you'll probably find that it will hit conservative leaning networks harder, because they simply don't fact check to the same degree as more liberal-leaning networks.\n\nSo yeah.

Because another piece of early voting is that early/mail in  ballots cannot counted until after polls close. They can be opened and smoothed out for processing, but not actually tabulated until the end of in person voting, which delays the final count.\n\nSo instead I see my neighbors, support the school bake sale, and get a sticker to wear to work on Election Day \ud83e\udd85",

It starts with the idea that people are only betting money if they have a strong sense they\u2019ll get something out of it, not because they think it will change the outcome. So if this huge number of people (or small number of very rich people) are betting on one horse, you\u2019d probably start to think that horse is more likely to win. When it\u2019s a presidential candidate, people are going to assume there\u2019s information out there that is convincing enough for a win, otherwise why would people risk so much loss? It\u2019s more about perception than simply thinking they\u2019re changing the outcome. Better public perception will help a campaign, and in my opinion, this particular situation is more about getting trump supporters riled up and use it as another metric to try and prove there was election fraud when they lose. The billionaires placing these huge bets don\u2019t even care about the money lost, it\u2019s practically just a donation to the campaign.",

If that person does win, your \"stock\" is worth $1 but if they lose, it's worth nothing.\n\n\nThe cost of this \"stock\" is what changes when people buy yes/no \"stock\". The more money someone puts towards a candidate increases the price by lowering the supply of the \"stock\".\n\n\nSo the TLDR is, basically the betting odds on these sites are useless metrics because they are are just showing the price people are paying for the \"stock\". A 65% odds that these websites are reporting are just saying people are spending 65 cents to win a dollar if their candidate wins.\n\n\nHopefully that's not too confusing \ud83d\ude05",

As the result of a long and still ongoing legal dispute, if you registered to vote this summer using\u00a0[a form](https://www.eac.gov/voters/national-mail-voter-registration-form)\u00a0that the federal government produces to be used around the country, you would be allowed to vote in federal elections, but not in Arizona state or local elections, unless you also provided papers proving your citizenship.\n\nRead more: [https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/happy-election-day-voting-us-too-hard-rcna178304](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/happy-election-day-voting-us-too-hard-rcna178304)",

         "I had an amazing time voting in California.  More places should do it like this.\n\nBallot drop boxes are everywhere in the city 2 weeks before you even get your mail in ballot.  Everyone gets a mail in ballot if you are registered 2-3 weeks before Nov 5th.  You can drop off at any of these drop boxes at any time.  So far as I can tell, they pick up from these boxes daily.  And my vote was counted right away.  There's even a text alert that tracks my ballot and tells me when it's been counted.\n\nIf you want to vote in person, you can do so Mon-Sat starting a week before Nov 5.  You can even go to any polling location and cast a provincial ballot if you're going to be out of town.  It'll get counted a bit later, but you'll still be able to vote.\n\nI had time to research every candidate and measure from home.  I had no line, no stress, and cast my vote at my convenience.  Even had the sticker on the instructions so I could add it to my car window once I dropped it off.\n\nVoting should be easy.  Zero reason it shouldn't be like these nationwide.\n\nEdit: oh and we have same day registration if you're not registered.",

         "\n\nfrom the article:  \n> But why does the difficulty of voting depend upon where you live? The answer is that we have a hyperdecentralized system of running elections in the U.S. We don\u2019t run a single election or even 51 elections (for each of the 50 states plus Washington, D.C.). We instead run over 8,000 simultaneous elections, often on the county level.",

Then it\u2019s off to the armored Dropbox surrounded by security cameras. That was 3 weeks ago and I\u2019ve already got email confirmation that my ballot was accepted after being compared to a history of my signatures.\n\nThe rest of the nation looks like it\u2019s stuck in a different century.",
         "It's phenomenal. I live in a 100% vote by mail state. I placed my ballot in a drop box 15 days ago, and received confirmation of receipt and verification later the same day. I don't have to go stand in line today, and I already know my ballot has been counted. \n\nI have zero security concerns with it. Between signature confirmation and ballot tracking text notifications, I have full confidence in the accuracy of our system. And the actual physical paper ballot I filled out exists for recount purposes should that be necessary for either machine or hand recounting.",

Due to the nature of the bug and the demographics of Arizona, the overwhelming majority of those voters are legal US citizens. There was an attempt to require all of them to reregister, which would mean many of them would have to show up to the polls with citizenship documentation. They may not even be aware their registration was revoked and they need to reregister.",
         "Michigan too has made voting a breeze, with easy mail in voting and early voting options. But this only happened after a Democrat was made governor.",
         "And those 8000 elections are ran by and rules setup by partisan secretaries of state \n\nInteresting that you failed to mention that.  Almost like it blows the agenda you're trying to push completely out of the water",

         "So whats the solution? To limit who can vote for it to take less time?",
         "Is a state issued ID not a \"citizenship document\"",
         "Because issues dont occur in areas where the secretaries of state is a Dem (like Arizona - which is the 1st example in the article). Or do you want to ignore those because it \"blows the agenda you're trying to push completely out of the water\".",

         "I've had to wait over an hour to vote during early voting. That same location had a 3+ hour line election day.",
         "Depends on the reason for the wait.\n\nI think it's Ohio that doesn't scale the number of polling locations based on population. So an area with 15,000 people gets the same number of polling locations as an area with 150,000 people. It's by design to disenfranchise big city voters.",
         "It is not. As another example at the federal level, employers file an I-9 document when hiring a new employee. The purpose of this document is to prove eligibility to work in the United States by proving proof of identity and of employment authorization (citizenship or other authorization like a work visa). State issued ID cards can prove identity, but not citizenship. A birth certificate proves authorization (citizenship) but not identity.  A US passport does both.",
         "For most states, no. Your DL is not proof of citizenship. Even RealIDs are just proof of legal resistance. Enhanced IDs are proof of citizenship but few states offer them and few people get them.",
         "What is the reason or reasons behind the long wait?",
         "Lets assume thats true. Besides for inconvience of waiting so long why is it hard to actually vote? Once youre in is the actual ability to vote and process to vote hard?",
         "I looked into it apparently, if you're ID is post 1996 they classify that as proof. Pre 1996 you need a supporting document to vote for locally, but if you just want to vote federally you can swear under penalty of perjury that you're eligible to vote... Seems like a non issue",
         "Too many people not enough polling locations.\n\nYou can also find stories every election of locations running out of ballots and people having to wait hours for the county to figure out what to do about it.",
         "That's enough. Not everyone has 3-4 hours they can give up. It disenfranchises those with greater needs for being able to have their voice heard.",
         "That's where we are now after the successful legal challenges to the purge. The entire reason this came about is because for 200k Arizonans the post 1996 ID is not actually proof of citizenship due to a bug.",
         "okay that has to be fixed. But is it happening in a majority or even close to a majority of cities? The article headlines makes it as if its a widespread issue for almost everyone",
         "so whats the solution?",
         "It's usually a rotating issue. People in the city effected finally get pissed enough to speak out backed by media support for positive change to happen. Meanwhile in the background another state will reduce the number of polling locations which will go largely unnoticed until election time when lines are hours long.\n\nIt's a reoccurring issue for blue cities in red states.",

Whatever she does, she's going to piss off one side.  And whatever side she choses, the Republicans are going to second gues instantly.",
         "I'd wager that that's exactly the same sentiment as it's been with Biden. Neither of them wants this war to continue. To claim otherwise is tinfoil-hatted at best, outright malicious most of the time.\n\nThe issue at hand is: It's bloody complicated to actually make happen - particularly when the leader in charge of one side is banking on the political opponent's return to power to get a blank cheque to escalate the crisis further while turning a blind eye to whatever violations happen in the future. \n\nAnd on the other side you have a terrorist organization backed by enemy nations, while one of them is actively conducting a war and trying to do what it can not only to interfere with the ongoing election and destabilize not just the US but the West as a whole, the other nation being led by religious zealots who will never acknowledge the right of the other side's people to even exist, period.\n\nI *wish* this utter shitshow was over, had never even escalated to this point, but this is *not* something that the USA can simply *decide* to end - it's a process that the current administration - alongside other big nations' leaders - has been pursuing for the past year and longer. A process which has been sabotaged time and again by new events and decisions outside of the administration's control taking place and exacerbating the situation time and again.\n\nWhich is to say: I firmly trust that Kamala Harris will do her utmost to bring this all-around humanitarian tragedy to an end. I do not believe she will sit idly by and let this shit continue. \n\nAnd hopefully, once she wins the presidency and gets into power, she will be able to put proper pressure on the ones responsible without it directly benefitting the other candidate who has made it abundantly clear that he would rather see Gaza razed to the ground with indiscriminate slaughter than actually strive for a stable, peaceful solution to an age-old conflict in the region.\n\nI know Kamala Harris will do her best to move things in the right direction. It might not be enough, who can say, but the effort will be genuine.\n \nI know that Donald Trump will do his worst to escalate things further and that he will never so much as attempt to genuinely care for human suffering, aside from his own grievances.",

It would have been nice to see her say something like this 3 months ago as opposed to, like, 2 days before the election. \n\nIt\u2019s not like she didn\u2019t have a million chances to approach the issue with more empathy toward Muslims. She had a chance during the DNC to allow a Palestinian-American to speak on their behalf with a pre-vetted speech that wasn\u2019t going to incite any inflammatory comments toward Israel, and they still didn\u2019t let that happen. Even with an entire Undecided delegation protesting outside feat. Ilhan Omar, they still didn\u2019t let that happen.\n\nBy all means, I would *hope* that more Arabs veer toward Kamala with this strategy, but considering how late in the game showing empathy towards the Gazan and Lebanese victims in her speech has come, I\u2019m going to assume that this is going to end up ringing hollow after a year\u2019s worth of genocide with no promise for a change in approach or rhetoric.",

The project was done on a cost plus basis, which means that Haliburton would profit no matter what at the expense of the taxpayer and one of [Haliburton\u2019s subsidiaries (Kellogg Brown and Root) didn\u2019t even provide quality products like what was expected.](https://youtu.be/IctIgY3QtNg?si=Jea32KOrLmty0xvG)\n\n>A cost-plus contract is an agreement where a buyer agrees to pay the actual costs of a project plus an additional fee to the contractor. Here\u2019s how it works:\n\n\t1.\tActual Costs: The buyer covers all the contractor\u2019s expenses needed to complete the project, like materials, labor, and equipment.\n\t2.\tPlus Fee: On top of these costs, the buyer also pays an extra amount, usually a percentage of the costs or a fixed fee, as the contractor\u2019s profit.\n\nSo, in a cost-plus contract, the contractor doesn\u2019t charge a fixed price up front. Instead, the buyer pays as the project progresses, based on real expenses plus a bit extra for the contractor\u2019s profit.

So many innocent lives lost. Desperate, hungry people fleeing for safety, over and over again. The scale of suffering is heartbreaking.\n\nThis does not center the rhetoric on the suffering of Gazans. We hear more about Hamas did October 7th and how it\u2019s actually a good thing that Israel is defending itself (ie, using a terrorist attack as an excuse to commit human rights violations next door, and then later on managing to spark a regional war with the rest of its neighbors) than we do about the suffering of Palestinians. All we get for that is that they\u2019re starving and scared, even though, by the point Kamala had made this speech, Israel was already bombing their hospitals, stopping aid and bombing independent aid workers, and the crossing of Biden\u2019s supposed red line with the invasion of Rafah (which they crossed and then he proceeded to do nothing on anyway).\n\nIf you don\u2019t understand why this might not be good enough for Arab-Americans who she needs to convince to go vote for her, then I do not know what to tell you. She made it clear over and over again that she was not budging on the issue, deviating an inch from Biden, who is already unpopular for his approach, all the way up until the very end where she finally changed her rhetoric to focus more on the Palestinian victims of the war.\n\nAgain, if she cared about Arab voters, she would have let a Palestinian-American speaker have a few minutes at the DNC. She gave a spot for an Israeli-American to talk, and it would not have cost them PR points to set up a few minutes for someone directly impacted by the war to be able to speak. The Undecided delegation even said they sent the DNC a copy of their speech to vet over for inflammatory language or anything that goes against the state\u2019s foreign policy on the matter and the DNC still wouldn\u2019t work with them.\n\nIf I was an Arab-American who is looking at the current administration  potentially helping bomb the shit out of my friends and neighbors overseas, and the official position has not been kind toward them, I\u2019m capable and empathetic enough to sit in their shoes to see why Kamala changing her rhetoric right now after seeing Trump trying to court Muslims might ring hollow to them.",

The only leverage USA has over those countries is that USA can go to war and kill them. Why is North Korea sending troops to fight for Russia in Ukraine? Why is Iran funding proxy militias to conduct terror campaigns all over the middle east?\n\nBecause *what the fuck are you gonna do about it*? Sanction them? They're already maximally sanctioned.

It\u2019s not like we entered the Middle East in the early 2000\u2019s promising to bring freedom into the region for people who deserved to live in peace and prosperity.\n\nThat portion is meaningless.

I do not believe she skew any further left in general than she has been, but I especially doubt she would suddenly change her mind on something she was adamantly committed gambling her election about.

         ">Is your argument acknowledging that the genocides in Yemen and Syria are bad while simultaneously holding the position that Israel should not be criticized for their genocide?\n\nNo, my position is that nothing happening in all 3 wars can be properly constituted as a genocide. Furthermore, my position is that the morality of either side in the Yemeni and Syrian Civil War is mixed while the morality in the Gazan war is clearly on the side of Israel. Israel didn't start this war. Hamas did. If Oct 7 didn't happen, there would be no war right now. Are there atrocities committed by the IDF? Of course. No war in history has ever seen completely moral conduct from either side. Allies committed war crimes during WW2, IDF has committed some war crimes during this war which must be prosecuted. After the war has been won. \n\n>Do you think if the genocides in Yemen and Syria got more coverage you would find criticism of the genocide by Israel to be acceptable? \n\nAcceptable in the sense that the criticizing parties are not hypocritical, yes. Acceptable in the sense that the irrational and vicious hatred of Israel is justified? No. \n\n>Like I don't get this position at all\n\nQuite simple. Most of the criticism against Israel right now is hypocritical when the same parties are mum on the Yemeni and Syrian Civil wars. Basically they have no legitimacy to criticism Israel for something Yemen, Syria, and Hamas get a pass for. \n\n>all genocide is bad\n\nYep. And what's happening isn't a genocide. Never was, never will be. \n\n>having relatives or ancestors who experienced genocide under the Nazi regime does not give Israel a genocide \"freebie\"\n\nTrue. And no grievance can possibly give its Arab neighbors, including Hamas, the moral right to cleanse Israel or fight for 'river to the sea'. \n\n>if anything it should make Israelis more critical and conscious of the apartheid and genocide their government is conducting.\n\nYes, which is why the government isn't committing genocide, unlike its Arab neighbour's and unlike what Hamas would do if they took over Israel, as they clearly showed on Oct 7",

         "Ah you seem to be heavily Israel-pilled so I will only give this one response since I don't expect to see you criticize Israel's genocidal campaign in any meaningful (or good faith) way.\u00a0\n\n\nLet's start with the definition of genocide:\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \"Genocide is the deliberate and systematic destruction of a group of people based on their race, ethnicity, nationality, or religion. Acts that constitute genocide include:\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 -Killing members of the group\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 -Causing serious mental or bodily harm to members of the group\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 -Deliberately creating conditions of life\u00a0 that will lead to the group's physical destruction\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 -Preventing births within the group\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 -Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group\"\n\n\nSo far, Israel has massacred an estimated 40,000 Gazans of whom over 50% of the population are children. Prior to Oct 7, the IDFs *own* estimates of Hamas' numbers was around 15,000 so if their \"most precise munitions in the world\" and \"most humane amount of civilians killed in history\" claims were actually true, they'd have wiped out Hamas ages ago and still have killed over 30,000 civilians/15,000 children. That's not including all (and there are a lot) of the instances of journalists clearly-marked in press vests as well as children being deliberately killed by IDF snipers (weapons that are incredibly accurate at long range and allow you to clearly see your target being a child or journalist from afar with a scope). They are killed because they are Gazan (nationality) and then there are also killings of Arabs in West Bank based on their Arab ethnicity. Hospitals and schools are bombed which is a war crime and the same excuse provided by IDF every time that \"kHamas was using these buildings as headquarters\" but not allowing 3rd party investigations to confirm these claims, only internal investigations. So no real proof but if you're Israel-pilled hard enough you'll believe these claims without needing proof of investigations by 3rd parties. IDF also had Gaza in blockade for decades restricting access to building supplies (forcing them to live in squalor and rubble unable to rebuild their infrastructure that Israel destroyed), their own fishing waters, and at times even food which qualifies as \"Deliberately creating conditions of life\u00a0 that will lead to the group's physical destruction.\" They terrorized Gazan civilians by telling them too evacuate to southern Gaza for safety, then bombing those same civilians on their way to seek refuge and bombing them again once they've formed camp. That covers \"Causing serious mental or bodily harm to members of the group.\" Point is, there is absolutely a case for genocide here and multiple human rights organizations have already decried it as a genocide. Only someone approaching this discussion with incredible bias or simple bad faith could claim it \"never was, never will be\" a genocide.\n\n\nYou spoke about grievances that might cause an attack from Hamas without acknowledging the Nakba, decades of blockades preventing the area from rebuilding at even getting food at times (Israel has claimed kHamas was using things like pasta, yeast, flour, cooking o oil, canned tuna, beans, black pepper, sugar, and rice were being used to make bombs. Literally trying to starve them out) and border massacres as recent as 2018. Yeah let's pretend none of these happened and Israel was just minding their business maintaining their border blockades for the good of the people. So innocent.\n\n\nYou probably don't know this since you seem to be just repeating taking points without any context or critical analysis, but the \"from the river to the sea\" slogan was originally a Zionist saying that the Palestinians co-opted. It was a saying Zionists used to rally behind while conducting mass ethnic displacement (a form of genocide Americans also conducted in the Natives and has happened to many other Natives across the world). Today, it is used at pro-Palestinian protests to call for the freedom of the Palestinian people. The only people who claim it is genocidal are Zionists who have an obvious motivation for doing so. Little bit of education for you there.\n\n\nTo use amorphous fears of \"what they would do to us\" to excuse massacring, terrorizing, and displacing large populations of civilians is immoral btw you have no guarantee that will happen and in similar historic situations this fear has shown to be unsubstantiated. Bit to mention that at face-value it is still not a good enough excuse to conduct genocide.\u00a0",

The FBI conducted a yearlong investigation into my emails. They concluded there was no case. He said the FBI was rigged. He lost the Iowa caucus. He lost the Wisconsin primary. He said the Republican primary was rigged against him. Then Trump University gets sued for fraud and racketeering. He claims the court system and the federal judge is rigged against him. There was even a time when he didn't get an Emmy for his TV program three years in a row and he started tweeting that the Emmys were rigged. This is a mindset. This is how Donald thinks. And it's funny but it's also really troubling. That is not the way our democracy works. We've been around for 240 years. We've had free and fair elections.

Wade?\n\nQuite possibly. People are generally far more motivated by being personally impacted at an existential level. What was driving a lot of the culture war in the late sixties and early seventies was the draft and Vietnam. As soon as we got out of Vietnam and successfully deposed a President the wind left the sails of 'the Movement'. Nixon had been duly punished by 'the people' and no one was being personally threatened by the possibility of being drafted and sent to Vietnam to die in the jungles for some abstract idea like \"making the world safe for democracy\". \n\nThe thing about abortion is that it's as existential for women as Vietnam was for men. It's a decision that no woman comes to lightly. They may not like abortion and they may not want to abort but they see no other choice under the circumstances (circumstances that are almost totally a result of external pressures). The freedom to choose was always there if you had to resort to. Publically you could say how awful it is etc but it's still a safety valve if you need it. And it has been there for 50 years. Generations of women have grown up assuming that the right to choose will be there if they need it.\n\nMy hope is that an Equal Rights Amendment will be the unanticipated result of the Republican/Christian dog catching the car being driven by liberated women.",

If Trump had appointed reasonable jurists who might lean conservative but still weigh their rulings according to the merits of the case, a second term for a president who would appoint such judges (instead of judges who would give him blanket immunity for all official acts, or even for any acts that would require using official acts as evidence) would not be nearly as scary.",

But that said, we can\u2019t even see from here who it will be.  JD Vance is a Peter Thiel tool.  I don\u2019t know that random backwoods racists are going to want to die for him.   MAGA must be defeated, but I will truly relish a Trump defeat as our D-Day in the war against MAGA if Kamala wins tomorrow.",
         "Yup. I think this is something I continue to struggle with. My partner and I have had a lot of conversations about what we'll do if trump were to win. Putting Harris in office would prevent trump's day-1 agenda and give us at least one branch of government protecting our rights. But so what?\n\nTrump is simply the figurehead for a much larger, longer-term issue. The idea that we can have an experienced, level-headed, multiracial history-making candidate who is backed by nearly every celebrity of note on both sides of the aisle and run a nearly flawless (though short) campaign... and yet still be neck-and-neck with a microphone-fellating elderly criminal means the problem isn't Trump, it's like... half the american people who agree with his views and his message.\n\nEven if he goes away, what do people expect for the next election? The republicans will put another extreme right candidate up, probably a smoother talking one who's more outwardly palatable to the independent voters. The novelty of a female president will have worn off and the urgency that stems from \"Trump the Enemy\" will be gone, making it a challenge for Harris's re-election. Fear and division will still be effective republican strategies. The man will be gone, but everything else about the MAGA folks will still be around and more strategic than ever.\n\nI have no idea what the plan is to change the minds that need to be changed. I don't know how to get people to stop caring about trans bathrooms, or equating immigrants with crime. I'm not sure how we as a nation can get to a place where presidential elections are about boring policy disagreements and not have one side radically trying its best to dismantle democracy.",
         "Yepp. They're gonna find a more palatable face to put the same bonkers ideas behind.",
         "While this is going to be unfortunately true, I think Trump himself was an important part of making it have such a resurgence. Like people seem to forget that prior to his first term(and even during it) he was very charismatic, funny to listen to, and just generally a really good candidate in a \"Lets troll shit\" sorta way. And coming against so many kinda blah bureaucrats he had a novelty that really propelled him with Independents. However pretty quickly he butted heads with the moderate and established people he had on his team, got rid of them, and RAPIDLY took a turn towards ever darker extremes of the Conservative side, and all of this before his clear cognitive decline, and the overwhelming bitterness that consumed him after the Election loss and his cornucopia of felonies in an attempt to keep power. But without Trump as a lightening rod, i don't see anyone with the personality to herd the roiling mass of Right wing groups. And i think MAGA kinda just ends up eating itself for a tad.",

The pump was primed for the uninformed proletariat to accept him as an anointed economic and political genius, the poster boy for American Royalty, the guy with an infallible eye for what works and the solid steel balls to separate the wheat from the chaff and send the weak links packing. You can\u2019t buy 40 years of cultural image-building, and PR Firms can\u2019t build it from scratch. \n\nLikewise, his pathology, the charismatic psychopath with malignant narcissism, gives him unique power over an audience that basically grew up with him as a household name.

I remember a lot of people thinking \"well, I have to vote for her, but I don't want to.\"  A lot of people stayed home. Donald Trump won and a lot of people wished they'd voted or not voted third party or whatever.  Yet, he still didn't \"win win\", he failed to get the popular vote and barely managed to squeak out an electoral college win. \n\n2020 and Donald has the incumbent advantage plus he's using the bully pulpit for all it's worth and using the presidential office resources to campaign for a second term.  I won't go so far as to say the Republicans cheated but they definitely put their finger on the scale as hard as they could.  And they *still* lost. \n\nThen you have all the shenanigans after the election and leading up to Jan 6.  Fox News has done a great job of sanewashing that shit but it still turned off a lot of moderate voters.  Even quite a few non-moderate Republicans saw it as a bridge too far.  \n\nThen Dobbs happened. Women are fucking rightfully pissed.  He's trying to juke and jive around the topic but we all know which party wants to limit reproductive rights and who's responsible here.  People really do believe Republicans would push a nationwide ban even if they say they won't. \n\nThen the midterms were supposed to be a red wave.  The economy was shit and that usually spells disaster for a sitting president and everyone knows presidents lose congressional support in the mid-terms.  Didn't happen. \n\nNow we are into 2024.  The Republicans want us to believe that somehow Donald Trump has more support than ever and it's going to be a landslide victory for Republicans.  I don't buy it. I can't see it.  When I drove through red country in 2016 and 2020, I knew something was up.  The amount of grassroots advertising for Trump was absurd.

         "> Decent people are different than the delicate balance of national security.\n\nTrue. Also irrelevant.\n\n> SpaceX is a leader in an insane amount of technologies that the state department are keen on keeping state side.\n\nYou packed a lot of bullshit into that sentence that you didn't understand.\n\nThe State Department is concerned with US diplomacy with other countries. It doesn't give a rat's ass about SpaceX. SpaceX isn't involved in interstate diplomacy. The only reason the State department *might* get involved with SpaceX is with the import of a satellite from another nation, but the US Customs Department's got all of that handled 99.999% of the time.\n\nSpaceX being a leader of technologies is true, but the US is not even *slightly* worried about keeping it \"stateside.\" If Elon Musk attempted to remove it from the state, for any reason, the US would not allow such a move. If he's threatened to, or sold SpaceX's secrets to a non-US state, he's probably violated US law on export restrictions of military industrial secrets - ITAR and similar laws prohibit the transfer of certain kinds of sensitive technology, including rocket engineering. \n\nI could go on, but really, what's the point. Two vacuous sentences shouldn't need as much reply to discredit, but, here we are.",

         "You think the military contractor is going to be allowed to just head to Russia the second Musk wants to? The government practically has authority to nationalize SpaceX in an emergency it ain't going no where.\n\nMusk security clearance is the only issue but that's nothing special about him specifically.",
         "Right, but those were a fraction of the 90% of staff he laid off. My point is that twitter could have survived completely fine if he didn\u2019t intentionally tank it.\n\nMost large tech companies inflate wages and hire way too many employees just to prevent those people from working at some other company which could make a product that competes with them. If you talk to some engineers at these big companies, you\u2019ll find they often have very pointless roles. \n\nI know one dude whose job was to look through other people\u2019s code to find opportunities for efficiency. That being a full time role is very superfluous.",
         "[538](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2024-election-forecast/) has it as 50% Harris to 49% Trump with the tie breaking states being Pennsylvania with Harris leading by 0.1% chance and Nevada with Harris leading barely above dead even. \n\nI wouldn't be so pessimistic. It's a literal coin flip and turnout on early voting has leaned heavily toward Harris. Dems have a 51% chance of taking back the House but are unlikely at all to take back the Senate if 538 ends up being accurate. The map will be more in favor of a Dem Senate victory in 2026.",
         "It\u2019s clear you don\u2019t live in this country. Outside of manufactured hype, there\u2019s a strong movement against his hate. All data outside of paid pollsters shows a Harris victory.",

They could potentially stop starlink from operating in the US and launch investigations into Tesla. Unless he completely divests from any company with a federal contract. \n\nMost government contracts also have a provision about felons not being allowed to get these contracts so even a plea could trigger the same.",

         "SpaceX isn't his main agenda for pushing Trump. His main agenda is that he wants to stop BYD from taking storm and absolutely destroying tesla. This is why he wants trump to hard ban things from china. They've already created a vastly superior EV that cost a fraction of a tesla, it's only matter of time BYD takes over.",
         "None of that has anything to do with whether the company is publicly traded or not.  X, SpaceX + Starlink, The Boring Company, and his neural implant company are all privately owned.",

It\u2019s not about tech debt, he\u2019s working on the same codebase that has been worked on for many years and has already been decently well optimized.  Most social media are technically simple products, their difficulty arising in scaling a simple product to billions of users. That is a hard issue, but not one it takes 10\u2019000+ engineers to figure out.",
         "And Joe Biden has blanket power to do whatever\u2019s in the best interest of this country \u2014 and no court in the land can stop him. So, if we\u2019re playing hypotheticals your fantasy won\u2019t work.",
         "Untouchable he is not, not even close... Real question is how does he want his goose cooked - with or without the gravy from the derailed gravy train that is about to land this prick in prison? Roll on 6th November.",
         "It\u2019s not the case when at the core you have one simple product with one simple offering scaled up. Twitter has one product which is relatively unchanged throughout the last 5 years. Insta/facebook/google have had more meaningful changes to their products, but not enough to justify 10s of thousands of employees. Just think about how large that number is. \n\nMost employees are pretty heavily mismanaged too. I know someone close who left Google because by happenstance he was being overwhelmed with work whilst some colleagues essentially did nothing all day. He\u2019d also have to attend meetings with US teams even though he was based in the UK - this is normal in corps but it happened very frequently due to projects which should be with US ending up in UK due to bad project management/resource allocation.\n\nIt makes sense for these companies to hire as many people as they possibly can, as they literally have more money than sense, and even still it makes sense to keep competition at bay by keeping the best engineers in your own org. But it\u2019s not very healthy for the market.\n\nAs an aside, this is also why Google churns through products then quickly abandon them - some talented engineer with nothing to do and a want for visibility would work on or create some new app/feature, gain internal clout from its initial success and move to a better role, at which point the product is dumped with a team who didn\u2019t make it, don\u2019t understand it and don\u2019t care about it - it becomes unusable, then Google drops it due to low usage."

         "The Character and Eligibility of Donald Trump: A Critical Examination.\n\nThis paper examines Donald Trump\u2019s character and constitutional eligibility to serve as president, focusing on the disqualification clause in the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. A central argument is that his impeachment by Congress unequivocally establishes his ineligibility, as he engaged in insurrection on January 6th, 2021. He conspired with others to have Vice President Pence reject state-certified electors and incited his supporters into rebellion. Under the Constitution, such actions disqualify him from holding public office, mirroring historical precedents where Congress or governors have refused to certify the elections of individuals deemed by them to be insurrectionists. America\u2019s most esteemed presidents, like George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, are celebrated not only for their leadership but for their unwavering integrity and commitment to democratic principles. Washington\u2019s humility and dedication set the foundational values of the nation, while Lincoln\u2019s moral conviction preserved its unity during its most perilous times. In stark contrast, Trump\u2019s conduct\u2014both during his tenure and specifically on January 6th\u2014reveals a profound deficiency in character. His reckless and divisive actions pose a direct threat to the very fabric of democracy. This paper argues that, based on constitutional mandates and the essential qualities required of a president, Trump\u2019s character and actions categorically disqualify him from the presidency, irrespective of policy positions or partisan affiliations.\n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/384473246_The_Character_and_Eligibility_of_Donald_Trump_A_Critical_Examination/stats",

And I\u2019m seeing his ability to say anything with no repercussions waining more and more and even Fox News has started being out of step with him periodically. Even the people on his peripheral are causing blowback on him. The Tony Hinchcliffe standup seems like it really angered a large portion of the Puerto Rican community. If even a quarter of them in the swing states decide to stay home and not vote for trump that is a major blow. \n\nI grew up outside Springfield Ohio and much of my family and extended family is still there.

Instead he has been a constant laughing stock and keeps diving in likability and it feels like Ohioans and even folks from his home town don\u2019t care for him. \n\nAnyways I hope I\u2019m right, but from my personal observations, I can\u2019t see him performing better than he did in 2020, while Harris and Walz have reinvigorated democrats apathetic over Biden and it\u2019s now much more than just never Trump.

         "No data that I'm aware of, but the theory is at least workable.\n\nAt minimum, we know an unprecedented number of senior Republicans have supported the Democratic nominee, including high level officials from Trump's own administration.\n\nThe assumption is that this represents an unprecedented portion of the Republican electorate that wish to oppose Trump even to the point of supporting a Democrat. Either folks that have come to that on their own, or were influenced by these senior Republicans.\n\nThere are lots of anecdotes of people knowing conservative friends or family members that are voting for a Democrat for the first time, ever, for some of them.\n\nAnd there's clearly a lot of support for abortion within the Republican electorate. This is made plain when protection for abortion is on the ballot alongside positions to be filled. The politicians get voted on in what is close to the normal political lean of the location, but abortion gets somewhere in the neighborhood of 70% support. It's not necessarily super crazy that those people that both vote red and support abortion would vote against the guy that facilitated the end of Roe.\n\nSo, put all that together, you've got pretty strong evidence of some crossover voting, and who might be doing that crossing over, but no great sense of how much or what the final impact will be. Could it legitimately be like 15% shift toward Harris? That would be crazy. Is it impossible?... probably not.\n\nNot likely. Probably much less. Will it turn this election into a landslide?\n\nThere's a viable theory how it might. And, my own personal opinion being that it should have been a landslide back in the Republican primary in 2016, barring Trump from even getting the nomination, it's of course attractive to me to think that theory has some merit.\n\nBut margin of error being what it is, it's equally likely that this is going to, yet again, be a much closer election than I believe it has any right to be.",

         "**From Hugh Dougherty, author of the article:**\n\nTwo of television\u2019s biggest names broke through days of silence from their networks about the bombshell tapes revealed by the Daily Beast in which\u00a0[Jeffrey Epstein](https://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/jeffrey-epstein/)\u00a0speaks about his relationship with\u00a0[Donald Trump](https://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/donald-j-trump/).\n\n[Rachel Maddow](https://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/rachel-maddow/)\u00a0on MSNBC and\u00a0[Jimmy Kimmel](https://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/jimmy-kimmel/)\u00a0on ABC both spoke of their shock at the tapes, with the late-night host complaining that they had not been widely covered by other outlets.\n\nOn MSNBC, Maddow listed what she termed \u201cOctober surprises,\u201d comparing the tape to the revelation that Trump\u2019s former chief of staff John Kelly and the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mark Milley, said\u00a0[Trump is a textbook fascist](https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-is-a-hitler-loving-literal-fascist-says-ex-chief-of-staff/), and to the Iowa poll that put Harris\u00a0[three points ahead in the deep-red state](https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-is-a-hitler-loving-literal-fascist-says-ex-chief-of-staff/).\n\nOn ABC, Kimmel, who is not bound by news standards, spoke freely about his shock at the recording and hinted at the silence that surrounded the Beast\u2019s bombshell.\n\n\u201cWe heard a bombshell audio tape in which Jeffrey Epstein says he was Trump\u2019s \u2018closest friend\u2019 and shares a bunch of crazy stories. This barely moves the needle,\u201d Kimmel said. \u201cRemember when\u00a0[Mitt Romney](https://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/mitt-romney/)\u00a0went down because\u00a0[he put a dog carrier](https://www.thedailybeast.com/romney-dog-loved-trips-atop-car/)\u00a0on the roof of his car?
