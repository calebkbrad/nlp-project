They didn\u2019t care whether the government banned it, just how their Christian faith guided their own actions.\n\nI am not going to engage in victim-blaming; no human being deserves what happened to this young woman. But what I want to point out is the craven brutality of \"exception for the life of the mother\" that some anti-abortion people like to spew. Because it's sounds great in theory, it helps them resolve the moral quandary of wanting to control other people's bodies without coming across as cruel bastards. \n\nBut think about what \"exception for the life of the mother\" mean. Imagine we took the same approach for all other medical issues. No treatment for headaches & migraines unless the life of the patient is in danger. Imagine a shark bites off your foot and you're taken quickly to the hospital and doctors just stand around waiting for you to be near death before intervening. Imagine how much fucking pain people will be needlessly subjected to and how many people will die for no reason at all. Next time you hear that bullshit phrase, realize what the person is saying: I want women to suffer needlessly till they're at the point of death before we give them routine medical care.

How are legislators able to block doctors from upholding the Hippocratic oath is my question? They have no experience as physicians yet they're dictating medical practice?

Her (divorced) mother had schizophrenia, and disappreared without warning one day when she was only 8, leaving neighbours to find her father and send her there. \n\n(The other cases I know were life of the mother, with severe kidney disease, and one where twins had basically half a brain between them, unlikey to survive outside the womb for very long.)\n\nNo woman decides at the 7th or 8th month -\"I changed my mind, I don't want a child\". When the Republicans trot out that lie, they are just lying to create fear.  Nobody murders a baby after birth - in no state is that legal.  All sorts of misinformation is said by the side that wants to control women. \n\nAlmost nobody uses abortion as birth control, when you condsider the cost and the toll it takes on a woman's body.  Some women may be OK with an abortion when they consider what it could have done to their life to have a child at that time, but never is it a casual decision. \n\nAnd we are seeing today, there are often valid serious medical reasons why treatment around pregnancy problems should never be complicated by legalities. It's dangerous. It can be lethal. \n\n(And a a side note, many states that do have such onerous laws are having trouble attracting new doctors.

You can love the unborn and advocate for them without substantially challenging your own wealth, power, or privilege, without re-imagining social structures, apologizing, or making reparations to anyone. They are, in short, the perfect people to love if you want to claim you love Jesus, but actually dislike people who breathe. Prisoners? Immigrants? The sick? The poor? Widows? Orphans? All the groups that are specifically mentioned in the Bible? They all get thrown under the bus for the unborn.\u201d",

The only thing they'll advocate is abstinence until marriage because it's not about abortions or families or babies or any of that, it's about making sure people who have sex are punished.\n\nCorrect. One of the biggest eye-openers is how much they are against funding for chronically underfunded foster care systems, and even the very idea of expanding ideas like WIC to all parents, medical coverage for child birth, and so on.\n\nMake it easier to have or give a child up for adoption in good conscience?

So, even though she told me she is a Republican because she is pro life she actually thought everything with Roe (along with Hyde and Casey) was reasonable and good, she was just ignorant of what Roe did all together. Or so she says, my mom plays dumb to avoid accountability all the time. Regardless, it was infuriating. \n\nAnyway, I went on to tell her great you should know that you are actually totally fine with what they just took away and as a result my life is much more dangerous. I read to her about the purposeful and senseless death of Savita Halappanavar. Our family has Irish origins and we are in contact with our relatives abroad so I was hoping this with resonate with her. As I\u2019m sure you know, Ireland voted to have their own protections for abortion via referendum after she died. A Catholic country!! \n\nShe countered by telling me what she thought was a genuinely sweet story of a young mother she knew who found out she had cancer while she was pregnant. She decided to wait on any treatment until after she gave birth. She gave birth and the cancer killed her, leaving her husband and children without her. MY MOM THOUGHT THIS WAS A NICE STORY. There is no small contingent of people who think women should die. It is fucked.",

         "The Character and Eligibility of Donald Trump: A Critical Examination.\n\nThis paper examines Donald Trump\u2019s character and constitutional eligibility to serve as president, focusing on the disqualification clause in the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. A central argument is that his impeachment by Congress unequivocally establishes his ineligibility, as he engaged in insurrection on January 6th, 2021. He conspired with others to have Vice President Pence reject state-certified electors and incited his supporters into rebellion. Under the Constitution, such actions disqualify him from holding public office, mirroring historical precedents where Congress or governors have refused to certify the elections of individuals deemed by them to be insurrectionists. America\u2019s most esteemed presidents, like George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, are celebrated not only for their leadership but for their unwavering integrity and commitment to democratic principles. Washington\u2019s humility and dedication set the foundational values of the nation, while Lincoln\u2019s moral conviction preserved its unity during its most perilous times. In stark contrast, Trump\u2019s conduct\u2014both during his tenure and specifically on January 6th\u2014reveals a profound deficiency in character. His reckless and divisive actions pose a direct threat to the very fabric of democracy. This paper argues that, based on constitutional mandates and the essential qualities required of a president, Trump\u2019s character and actions categorically disqualify him from the presidency, irrespective of policy positions or partisan affiliations.\n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/384473246_The_Character_and_Eligibility_of_Donald_Trump_A_Critical_Examination/stats",

         "Yup. I think this is something I continue to struggle with. My partner and I have had a lot of conversations about what we'll do if trump were to win. Putting Harris in office would prevent trump's day-1 agenda and give us at least one branch of government protecting our rights. But so what?\n\nTrump is simply the figurehead for a much larger, longer-term issue. The idea that we can have an experienced, level-headed, multiracial history-making candidate who is backed by nearly every celebrity of note on both sides of the aisle and run a nearly flawless (though short) campaign... and yet still be neck-and-neck with a microphone-fellating elderly criminal means the problem isn't Trump, it's like... half the american people who agree with his views and his message.\n\nEven if he goes away, what do people expect for the next election? The republicans will put another extreme right candidate up, probably a smoother talking one who's more outwardly palatable to the independent voters. The novelty of a female president will have worn off and the urgency that stems from \"Trump the Enemy\" will be gone, making it a challenge for Harris's re-election. Fear and division will still be effective republican strategies. The man will be gone, but everything else about the MAGA folks will still be around and more strategic than ever.\n\nI have no idea what the plan is to change the minds that need to be changed. I don't know how to get people to stop caring about trans bathrooms, or equating immigrants with crime. I'm not sure how we as a nation can get to a place where presidential elections are about boring policy disagreements and not have one side radically trying its best to dismantle democracy.",
         "Yepp. They're gonna find a more palatable face to put the same bonkers ideas behind.",
         "While this is going to be unfortunately true, I think Trump himself was an important part of making it have such a resurgence. Like people seem to forget that prior to his first term(and even during it) he was very charismatic, funny to listen to, and just generally a really good candidate in a \"Lets troll shit\" sorta way. And coming against so many kinda blah bureaucrats he had a novelty that really propelled him with Independents. However pretty quickly he butted heads with the moderate and established people he had on his team, got rid of them, and RAPIDLY took a turn towards ever darker extremes of the Conservative side, and all of this before his clear cognitive decline, and the overwhelming bitterness that consumed him after the Election loss and his cornucopia of felonies in an attempt to keep power. But without Trump as a lightening rod, i don't see anyone with the personality to herd the roiling mass of Right wing groups. And i think MAGA kinda just ends up eating itself for a tad.",

The power vacuum with Trump gone and incommunicado will cause the different factions to fight each other, and they won't be able to gain consensus. Trump gone will at least seriously hurt MAGA and may even kill them, especially if it results in them being slaughtered electorally for the next couple of cycles.

There's been so much talk about how women are out to vote because of it, but is there so much voter apathy that we would be staring down the barrel of another Trump presidency had the Supreme Court not buried Roe v. Wade?\n\nQuite possibly. People are generally far more motivated by being personally impacted at an existential level. What was driving a lot of the culture war in the late sixties and early seventies was the draft and Vietnam. As soon as we got out of Vietnam and successfully deposed a President the wind left the sails of 'the Movement'. Nixon had been duly punished by 'the people' and no one was being personally threatened by the possibility of being drafted and sent to Vietnam to die in the jungles for some abstract idea like \"making the world safe for democracy\". \n\nThe thing about abortion is that it's as existential for women as Vietnam was for men. It's a decision that no woman comes to lightly. They may not like abortion and they may not want to abort but they see no other choice under the circumstances (circumstances that are almost totally a result of external pressures). The freedom to choose was always there if you had to resort to. Publically you could say how awful it is etc but it's still a safety valve if you need it. And it has been there for 50 years. Generations of women have grown up assuming that the right to choose will be there if they need it.\n\nMy hope is that an Equal Rights Amendment will be the unanticipated result of the Republican/Christian dog catching the car being driven by liberated women.",
         "> There's been so much talk about how women are out to vote because of it, but is there so much voter apathy that we would be staring down the barrel of another Trump presidency had the Supreme Court not buried Roe v. Wade? \n\nIf the Supreme Court had not buried Roe v. Wade, that would mean Trump hadn't appointed judges who rule with the mindset of forcing their personal ideologies on the rest of the country. If Trump had appointed reasonable jurists who might lean conservative but still weigh their rulings according to the merits of the case, a second term for a president who would appoint such judges (instead of judges who would give him blanket immunity for all official acts, or even for any acts that would require using official acts as evidence) would not be nearly as scary.",

Both parties have corrupt actors but in the Democratic Party it is not tolerated. It is rooted out and the actors are dealt with. A felon could not run at the top of the Democratic ticket. There are consequences for fucking around. There shouldn't only be consequences for one political party. It's gotten out of hand and absolutely ridiculous.",

         "That's actually more likely than it seems, too. The sentencing is happening mid-November, and was clearly moved for political reasons, not because of logistics. \n\nThe judge was clearly reluctant to sentence Trump during his campaign, least of all after he'd been declared the official candidate of the GOP. At best, it'd have been god-awful optics, and more likely it'd have tipped the scales heavily in Trump's favor while he appealed.\n\nThe case was already too far delayed and too close to the election. In that sense, Trump won by forcing another big delay to sentencing. \n\nOn the other hand, Trump made this election his lifeline, because now it's either he loses and the sentence can be as harsh as appropriate for a major felon, or if he wins the sentence will come down in such a way that it'll still hurt him without giving him an opportunity to play the victim from behind bars / turning himself into a martyr. There are other ways to punish him than straight up prison, in that sort of case - and some might be even more humiliating for him.\n\nIn a way, Judge Merchan has made his sentence dependent on the election's results. A loss would make a prison sentence infinitely more likely - particularly with expectations of him refusing to accept the results or staging another coup attempt.",

He was able to dupe the horde because he\u2019s been parading around as America\u2019s Most Brilliant Businessman in books and television since the fuckin 1980s. The pump was primed for the uninformed proletariat to accept him as an anointed economic and political genius, the poster boy for American Royalty, the guy with an infallible eye for what works and the solid steel balls to separate the wheat from the chaff and send the weak links packing. You can\u2019t buy 40 years of cultural image-building, and PR Firms can\u2019t build it from scratch. \n\nLikewise, his pathology, the charismatic psychopath with malignant narcissism, gives him unique power over an audience that basically grew up with him as a household name. Vance is a sociopath, and he\u2019s deeply unappealing. DeSantis is a malignant narcissist but he has net zero charisma. Trump\u2019s kids have brand recognition, but they\u2019re all deeply unlikable and politically stupid. \n\nWithout Trump, MAGA may not go away, but it will definitely struggle.

         "I think rally sizes are considered gauges of enthusiasm among potential voters for a particular candidate.  People who don't care or aren't into a candidate won't go to a rally.  So if there are lots of people going to rallies, we can guess they are enthusiastic about that candidate.  Enthusiastic people tend to vote, so it's a good sign.\n\nIn the past, nobody really talked about crowd sizes at political rallies.  Trump, because he is a crowd size queen, made it out to be a sign of his popularity.  His shiny new Press Secretary told his first lie on his first day at the podium in the press room - he was directed by Trump to lie about Trump's Inauguration Day crowd size being bigger than Obama's, bigger than any Inauguration in history, even though we saw the pictures side by side with our own eyes.  Since then, crowd size has become a constant topic.",

It\u2019s a lot like tailgating before a sporting event. I think that\u2019s why his support is so strong, because people support him like they would a football team. You\u2019re with the team in the good and bad times, you don\u2019t switch sides because your team lost a game (or a debate).

It\u2019s also worrying to me that he still seems to have so many supporters for being such a shit person as a human being and at basically everything. We project what we know everywhere and my projection is most people support him. It\u2019s basically what I see and what I know.\n\nSo that\u2019s where my fear lies. Maybe my perspective is more truthful to how most of America thinks and maybe those oppose to trump are just echoing louder so it seems like a larger number.\n\nI don\u2019t think this is the case but I\u2019d be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t slightly worried my perspective might be more of how America truly is.",

         "Yeah I'm sorry, I'm going to strongly disagree with you here. Trump has a history of packing venues for his rallies. In 2016 and 2020 he was good for packing rallies. Even in early 2024 things were looking normal.\n\nThese recent rallies have died off days before election. Why would folks stop attending his rallies at the most exciting part of the election cycle? His supporters absolutely look at his rallies as a reason to vote for him and support him.\n\nI think they are embarrassed and simply aren't enthusiastic.  Trump got 77 million votes nationally in 2020. I wonder if he'll even match that number. I suspect Harris exceeds Bidens 2020 numbers though, BTW.",
         "Right but the trend is what's important. Trump has for a very long time had huge draws to his events and it seems attendance has simply fallen off a cliff recently. Conversely Kamala's rallies have continued to grow in size and membership (if we look at the diversity of artist guests and Republican politician attendees). It is the trend and rate of change in these events' attendance which is more useful for gauging support. Still it's a soft indicator, but it absolutely the trend Dems want to see as opposed to Trump increasing his numbers at this stage.",

         "I think we're at the perfect knife-edge. We have a very real chance of winning if everyone pulls together, and if you do your very best to turn EVERYONE out we might get a surprise result that's way more than we hoped for. That latter possibility completely evaporates without our own action, without our WORK, and that's a stressful but ideal place to be the night before.

Lots of American flags, lots of racism, their candidate is bigger and meaner and will \"kick ass\". So to Trump's voters, seeing this lack of support at these rallies matters. It matters more than it should.",

So you get these ever escalating costs because the point becomes to spend as much money as possible in as many different states and districts as possible, rather than to actually build the damn thing that NASA needs to fulfill its objectives. SpaceX isn't saving money by \"causing humanitarian crises around  the world\", they're saving money by building what NASA needs rather than whatever buys Congress critters the most votes.",

         "This reminds me of the fox domestication experiment. A very long running project in Russia where foxes were selected for their absence of fear when approached by a human instead of cowering away in fear and allowing the human contact and even show the curiosity you mention.\n\nSelective breeding increased this. The brains of the tamer animals showed neurochemical changes like increased serotonin levels.\n\n>Perhaps the most important observation emerging from this series of experiments is the fact that tame females exhibit statistically significant changes in certain neurochemical characteristics in such regions of the brain as the hypothalamus, midbrain, and hippocampus. The level of serotonin and its metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid turned out to be higher in tame than in unselected females. This fact fits the type of behavior, since serotonin is known to inhibit some kinds of aggression. Serotonin plays a role in the central regulation of the hypothalmic-hypophyseal-adrenal-sexual system. Thus, selection for tame behavior is associated with changes in both the central and peripheral mechanisms of the neuro-endocrine control of ontogeny.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domesticated_silver_fox\n\nInteresting is that the opposite was also tried.\n\n>Breeding for aggression\n\n>After initiating his selective breeding program for tameness, Belyayev also began breeding a line of fearful, aggressive foxes. In addition, he started domesticating other animals. He and his team started working with rats in 1972, and later with minks and, briefly, with river otters, although this last experiment was abandoned because the species \"proved difficult to breed\". The experiments with rats and minks, however, proved successful, with the subjects becoming tame alongside the foxes. After Belyayev's death, his rat experiment was carried on by Irina Plyusnina. \"Siberian gray rats caught in the wild, bred separately for tameness and for ferocity\", reported The New York Times, \"have developed ... entirely different behaviors in only 60 or so generations\".[8] When geneticist Svante P\u00e4\u00e4bo was in Novosibirsk in 2003, he visited the institute, and \"was stunned\" by the two groups of rats. \"After just 30 years of selection\", P\u00e4\u00e4bo said, \"the IC&G researchers had fashioned two populations that could hardly be more different.\"\n\nWhat if more peace loving Democrats and more agressive Republicans prefer partners from their own group and this results in selective 'breeding' causing similar enhancement of these traits as was achieved in these animal experiments? Could we expect the extremer behaviour to become even more extreme over the generations? A chilling thought.",

         "The Character and Eligibility of Donald Trump: A Critical Examination.\n\nThis paper examines Donald Trump\u2019s character and constitutional eligibility to serve as president, focusing on the disqualification clause in the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. A central argument is that his impeachment by Congress unequivocally establishes his ineligibility, as he engaged in insurrection on January 6th, 2021. He conspired with others to have Vice President Pence reject state-certified electors and incited his supporters into rebellion. Under the Constitution, such actions disqualify him from holding public office, mirroring historical precedents where Congress or governors have refused to certify the elections of individuals deemed by them to be insurrectionists. America\u2019s most esteemed presidents, like George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, are celebrated not only for their leadership but for their unwavering integrity and commitment to democratic principles. Washington\u2019s humility and dedication set the foundational values of the nation, while Lincoln\u2019s moral conviction preserved its unity during its most perilous times. In stark contrast, Trump\u2019s conduct\u2014both during his tenure and specifically on January 6th\u2014reveals a profound deficiency in character. His reckless and divisive actions pose a direct threat to the very fabric of democracy. This paper argues that, based on constitutional mandates and the essential qualities required of a president, Trump\u2019s character and actions categorically disqualify him from the presidency, irrespective of policy positions or partisan affiliations.\n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/384473246_The_Character_and_Eligibility_of_Donald_Trump_A_Critical_Examination/stats",

         "Wonder why it got downvoted then? Too many people on reddit can\u2019t handle something being bad for both sides. They\u2019re so programmed that preventing a vote for Trump should be done at any cost and by any means, even if said means is considered unacceptable if it prevents a Harris vote. At least you\u2019re not that insane.s",
         "I do feel like we should address that the polls that tend to show that are often missing some critical data points. We are at a much higher rate of having suffered abuse, yes, but we also have a large cohort of us will try to date men to be \"normal\" and because we don't have attraction to men we tend to just kind of pick one, based on peer pressure or what have you. That puts us at a much higher risk of experiencing abuse from an intimate partner before we start dating women. I'm not saying abuse doesn't happen in lesbian relationships between two women, but people who love to bandy that point around (often right wingers) miss critical explanatory context.",

Trump openly calls for violence against people he doesn\u2019t like. Most recently he called for someone to shoot at the media while he cowers behind bullet proof glass from the monster he foments. Only one party is putting our ads saying \u201cWomen, you can vote for whomever you want, your vote is secret.\u201d because they know their husband could very likely abuse them for it.\n\nThe whataboutisms like the one you threw at me are hollow, tiresome, and disingenuous.

         "I think people believe that many women with Republican husbands are not in situations where they feel they have a choice. This comes because of the Theocratic ideologies that often exist in Republican households.

         "The Character and Eligibility of Donald Trump: A Critical Examination.\n\nThis paper examines Donald Trump\u2019s character and constitutional eligibility to serve as president, focusing on the disqualification clause in the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. A central argument is that his impeachment by Congress unequivocally establishes his ineligibility, as he engaged in insurrection on January 6th, 2021. He conspired with others to have Vice President Pence reject state-certified electors and incited his supporters into rebellion. Under the Constitution, such actions disqualify him from holding public office, mirroring historical precedents where Congress or governors have refused to certify the elections of individuals deemed by them to be insurrectionists. America\u2019s most esteemed presidents, like George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, are celebrated not only for their leadership but for their unwavering integrity and commitment to democratic principles. Washington\u2019s humility and dedication set the foundational values of the nation, while Lincoln\u2019s moral conviction preserved its unity during its most perilous times. In stark contrast, Trump\u2019s conduct\u2014both during his tenure and specifically on January 6th\u2014reveals a profound deficiency in character. His reckless and divisive actions pose a direct threat to the very fabric of democracy. This paper argues that, based on constitutional mandates and the essential qualities required of a president, Trump\u2019s character and actions categorically disqualify him from the presidency, irrespective of policy positions or partisan affiliations.\n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/384473246_The_Character_and_Eligibility_of_Donald_Trump_A_Critical_Examination/stats",

Some tidbits,  \n\n> But this cycle, with former President Donald Trump and Co. discovering it might be smart to encourage Republicans to vote early and even by mail (the horror!), the GOP vote has been frontloaded. The inverse is true and the question is whether the Democrats can overcome a 43,000-plus GOP ballot lead as I write this.\n> \n> But my theory of the case is there are still a lot of Clark County mail ballots to be counted that favor Democrats and the GOP partial cannibalization of its Election Day vote will propel some Democrats to victory but perhaps not quite get there with others.\n> \n> I have been calling this The Unicorn Election because of the unusual voting patterns.   \n> \n> The key to this election has always been which way the non-major-party voters break because they have become the plurality in the state. They are going to make up 30 percent or so of the electorate and if they swing enough towards Harris, she will win Nevada.  \n> \n> I know some may think this reflects my well-known disdain for Trump, heart over data.

They are dynastic orders so each order can only be led by the head of each dynasty. \n\nThe titles they use are Italian titles and those were legally extinguished after Italy became a republic so they might just be commoners who call themselves \u201cprince\u201d and \u201cduke\u201d.  There are quite a few of these pretenders in Europe but there are quite a few of those in the US too. It\u2019s a bit doubtful whether they qualify for the purposes of the Titles of Nobility Clause. They are also princes of two states, the Kingdom of the Two Scillies and the Duchy of Parma and Piacenza, that were abolished back in the 1800s due to getting annexed during Italian unification. \n\nIt seems Carlos, Duke of Parma is legally a noble due to being part of the Dutch royal family with the legal title Prince Carlos de Bourbon de Parme. But it looks like both claimants to the head of the other branch of the order are both legally commoners who just use \u201ccustomary titles\u201d.

         "If we go with Alito's originalist/textualist mode of thinking then, sadly, this isn't a hard argument to rebut. The word \"Prince\" in the clause doesn't mean people with the literal title of \"Prince\", it's the legal shorthand for a monarch of somekind, generally one who is not fully sovereign but has a liege with some sovereign power over them, like the various counts, grafs, dukes, etc of the Holy Roman Empire at the time the constitution was written. The context of placing it alongside \"King\" and \"Foreign State\" shows the intention is to ban receiving titles from a sovereign power, whether monarchy or not, with whom the government would have relations as a foreign state. The House of Bourbon Two-Sicilies has not been a ruling royal house since the 1860s, and the state that gave them their name died with their rule, and if we accept that Papal sponsorship of the order satisfies that criteria then we have to interrogate a number of Catholic officials of the US government, including numerous ambassadors, who have accepted membership in various other papal orders, including Bill Donovan (head of the WWII O.S.S), and multiple US Ambassadors to the Holy See. \n\nBeyond that there is the debate whether being offered membership in a chivalric order is the same as being offered a 'title' because it confers no differentiated legal rights or privileges, excepting perhaps the fancy cosplay.\n\nBeyond a shadow of a doubt Alito accepting this 'honour' violates the spirit of the clause about public officials accepting baubles, honours, and trappings that undermine public confidence in their credentials to serve as leaders of a free people in a republican state, but the method for determining that is a more arduous impeachment proceeding looking at all their conduct. Alito should undergo that process for numerous flagrant displays that he has no care for that confidence, but he can't be hung on the word \"Prince\" alone.",

         "And, as a textualist, Alito would point out that the statues of the Order specify that the \"Merit\" division of the order is explicitly for \"commoners\", and that there are *separate* divisions for nobility, so that he is not being elevated with a title of nobility, far from it, he's explicitly being honoured as a 'common citizen'. Moreover the 'plain meaning' of \"Prince\" at the time of the constitution was \"sovereign ruler\", which the Bourbon Two-Sicilies are not, far from it, they can't even agree which of their number *would be* based on the laws of their own royal house.\n\nAll this is to say that there isn't \"true textualism\", because constitutions aren't mathematical formulae in which everything has a meaning that is exactly fungible person to person. They capture and attempt to enshrine a particular imagining of the way that government should work, or can work. It's always worth remembering that any way of working envisioned by a constitution is also a way government could work without it by mutual understanding and agreement. Constitutions are written because the imagined ideal, however imperfect in execution, is held to be more important than necesseities of moment that might demand compromises in that vision to achieve a specific policy objective. Put simply \"it's better we have freedom of speech than to have anything we could get more quickly by sacrificing it\", is a founding principle of America.\n\nTextualism is nothing more or less than a political project to provide a veneer of the inevitable and sacred to contemporary conservatism by making its objectives appear to be the intended fulfillment of that vision. If the broad mass of the people accept that reasoning then it follows that to question their objectives is to question the national project of America, which is a trap Democrats fall into constantly. It's core principle is that in saying \"it's better we have freedom of speech than to have anything we could get more quickly by sacrificing it\" we are not being appropriately specific, we should say something like \"it's better we have freedom of speech *(defining \"freedom of speech\" according to an arbitrary external rule for defining words) than to have anything we could get more quickly by sacrificing *(defining \"sacrificing\" according to an arbitrary external rule for defining words) it\". \n\nIn a sense it's a clever trick, because the debate becomes about the 'arbitrary external rule' and justifying which one to rely on, but that rule is not, in itself, a question that any case or law will touch on directly, so there's no 'precedent' concerning the specific rule, just on whether or not to use a rule at all. Therefore conservatives can rely on the same rhetoric and semantics to get an outcome they've decided they want, even if it's entirely at odds with how they reasoned the semantics of comparable cases before. You can see this in the move to reasoning from \"historical traditions\" in overturning Roe, which was the same line they rejected when it was employed to argue in favour of gun control by pointing out the militia context in the plain text of the second amendment.\n\nAll this is to say that there are a huge number of ineffective arguments to employ against Alito and his methodology, and inconsistency is amongst them. Far better to go straight for the jugular and point out you have, amongst the highest justices in the land, the people who should most carefully arbitrate in the interests of the people as a whole and the republican vision of the nation,  a man who thinks his job is to play clever word games.

One which is probably obvious, is that a lot of men think women are just emotional, and that once they get over their emotions they'll \"be rational\" and align with the way they think. The other is that they think this doesn't actually affect a lot of women directly, especially Republican women, because most women don't get abortions and once they're past their child bearing years they wont need them. For their base, they assume that they don't WANT their daughters and grand-daughters to get abortions.\n\nUltimately its that they can't put themselves into women's shoes and see how much of a threat abortion bans are to them, and its even harder for them to see how women who won't need abortions can empathize with women who might. I think a lot of this boils down to a lack of empathy. They can't see how an safe and legal abortion service is this super important and relief giving safety net that yes, no one wants to have to use, but so many are thankful and feel safer when they know they can if they need to.",

Fundamentally this is a concept that should have never been allowed for anything, but because most people figured they wouldn't actually go as far as to tamper with Roe nationally anyone raising the alarm was written off as an annoying feminist nag. Which was really popular to do circa 2015, even if many of those folk love to call themselves leftists today.\n\nBecause these were never intended to actually take effect, always just empty virtue signalling to Evangelicals, they were often written to be crazy extreme.

Polls, pundits and even Democrats (I think convinced by the polls) were saying it was going to be a humiliating night for Democrats across the country. The reality was completely different. Women and the yooths controlled the outcome:\n\n \"Among the youngest Americans, Democrats have held an advantage in votes for House of Representatives candidates in every midterm or presidential election since the late 1990s. Yet in 2022, the 18- to 29-year-old age group (made up of Gen Z and the youngest millennials) showed an even more pronounced shift toward Democrats. It is one of the few demographic groups to show a higher D-R margin in the nationwide House vote than for the 2020 presidential election (D-R value of 28 in 2022, compared to 24 in 2020). This is amplified by the fact that this age group\u2014as in the 2018 midterms and 2020 presidential election\u2014registered a rise in turnout compared to pre-2018 elections, according to a Tufts University analysis. \"\n\nhttps://www.brookings.edu/articles/midterm-exit-polls-show-that-young-voters-drove-democratic-resistance-to-the-red-wave/",

         "Oh, fiddlesticks. There are plenty of smart farmers. But shifts in the farming sector have weakened farm labor, so there's a chance for protectionist ideologues to move in. And the information environment that farmers in a particular region inhabit depends on all sorts of factors, including what kind of farms they have and what other firms of land use they compete with. \n\nOf course, Trump paid them off last time when his tariffs nearly broke them.\n\nI'd like to know more about Iowa farmers, and the rural Dems should absolutely engage them and get them organized.",
         "Iowa isn't Pennsylvania, but I'm betting farmers are just as smart there as anywhere. If you think you don't have to be smart to be a farmer in modern America and you think they're stupid, lazy and have life on \"easy mode\" you, respectfully, are misinformed.",

Dick was probably going to vote for Harris either way, since just about everyone who has ever held a prominent position in any administration is, but by answering the question he\u2019s also being a supportive daddy.",
         "Part of that is the structural advantage the Electoral College gives to Republicans, so for Democrats to have a shot, they need to be winning by 3-5% nationally, and given the number of swing states with similar demographics, they tend to move together.\n\nIn terms of the number of votes needed to change the result, Biden's victory in 2020 was closer than Bush's victory in 2004. Biden won by something like 45,000 votes in three states while Bush won Ohio by over 100,000 votes."

         "I think it would probably be more accurate to say women\u2019s right will save democracy. \n\nThere is a lot of focus, and rightly so, on the gap that trump has with women. At the same time, I don\u2019t see how higher male turnout only benefits trump. \n\nLook at the stories of women dying in Texas. I\u2019m pretty sure I have counted three this past week alone? Regardless of how much they may hate minorities, and I will fully admit to making this as an assumption and don\u2019t have any data to back it up, I think as a whole conservatives tend to have larger families than progressive and liberal minded people. \n\nThose deaths could play a big impact on how they vote. They don\u2019t want their daughters or granddaughters to die either. I think the idea of abortion as a legitimate medical service and not just for people that like to casually have sex and abort afterward (which I imagine is a fringe abuse case to begin with) could open at least some peoples eyes.",

You can never under-estimate racist Christians falling in line on voting day.\n\nI'm Kamala all day everyday, and this country is going to be saved by women. And LOTS of men don't deserve to be saved by the very women who have been oppressed for most their lifetimes, but it's just a side effect of women needing to have self-respect and make the right vote.\n\nThey came at women directly and are about to find out the consequences.",
         "It's not going to be as close as the polls show when all is said and done, tons of first-time voters are piling on Harris.

Her whole thing is just that Trump is absolutely a threat to democracy, and on that one issue, she's absolutely right. I can't help but hope that maybe her treatment by conservatives and the Republican Party will cause her to reanalyze all the conservative dogmas she believed in for so long. I was a lot younger than her when I did that, but it still gives me hope that it's possible. I'm sure it'll be a lot harder at her age, but if anything could give her the \"shock therapy\" to completely overhaul her entire worldview, this would be it.",

Criticize her all you want for that which she earned criticism, but co-chairing the committee that investigated Jan 6th and campaigning with Harris has been a huge help since we needed Rep voters too, to win. So credit where credit is due.\n\nIt doesn't forgive or whitewash her past, it just recognizes that today she is doing the right thing. That's it. Nothing in life is black and white.",

If they win, they gobble up more of the stock with their preferred stock options and preferred profit shares and then it's all theirs.\n\nTaxes?

         "The Character and Eligibility of Donald Trump: A Critical Examination.\n\nThis paper examines Donald Trump\u2019s character and constitutional eligibility to serve as president, focusing on the disqualification clause in the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. A central argument is that his impeachment by Congress unequivocally establishes his ineligibility, as he engaged in insurrection on January 6th, 2021. He conspired with others to have Vice President Pence reject state-certified electors and incited his supporters into rebellion. Under the Constitution, such actions disqualify him from holding public office, mirroring historical precedents where Congress or governors have refused to certify the elections of individuals deemed by them to be insurrectionists. America\u2019s most esteemed presidents, like George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, are celebrated not only for their leadership but for their unwavering integrity and commitment to democratic principles. Washington\u2019s humility and dedication set the foundational values of the nation, while Lincoln\u2019s moral conviction preserved its unity during its most perilous times. In stark contrast, Trump\u2019s conduct\u2014both during his tenure and specifically on January 6th\u2014reveals a profound deficiency in character. His reckless and divisive actions pose a direct threat to the very fabric of democracy. This paper argues that, based on constitutional mandates and the essential qualities required of a president, Trump\u2019s character and actions categorically disqualify him from the presidency, irrespective of policy positions or partisan affiliations.\n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/384473246_The_Character_and_Eligibility_of_Donald_Trump_A_Critical_Examination/stats",

Through vilification of what they don\u2019t know. Trump vilifies immigrants, the LGBTQ community, Black people, Hispanic people, Latin people, Arab people, women, Democrats, muslims, And people of different religions. I would say the only exception, is he doesn\u2019t have strong opinions about religion. The only reason he doesn\u2019t inherently, vilify religious beliefs. Is because he doesn\u2019t know anything about them. He is not a religious man, and he doesn\u2019t have a clue what is said in the Bible. His moral compass is non existent, but ultimately you have to be a scared person to be a Trump supporter. Trumps helps these people turn their fear into hate, by providing them a target. Everyone is in pain, we all have pain, but how we work through our struggles defines us. By vilifying anyone and everything, he distracts his base with an outlet to direct that pain and fear. That hate stemming from fear, appears to blind them as well, and for some reason allows them to live with one eye open and one eye closed.

An economic approach that weakend the economy, he didn\u2019t make the country money, he just spent through all the countries equity.

Why is it, a black and East Asian minority, needs to be flawless, and Trump can be lawless. I\u2019ll tell you, it\u2019s because of an implicit Bias that we all have to some degree, but we as people try to be better than to allow these insecurities to drive our decisions or thoughts. This Candidate has created a venue of immoral value where that is acceptable, and he has successfully normalized it. That is wrong, his base are the ones who coined, ALL LIVES MATTER, does that no longer hold true? Because even that statement was a response to BLACK LIVES MATTER.

He just needs to shut up and go away, forever.",
         "If it helps any, just know this:\n\nA **lot** of Republican voters have clearly expressed that they fully want Trump to go away if he loses. Well, I'm sure they want him around, but ***not*** in the political realm *as a Presidential candidate*. Wanna know why a lot of them are starting to say this much more frequently?\n\nIf Kamala wins, that then means there will have been 4 *more* years of yet another Democrat winner. When you look outside of this vacuum of time right now and look at the much bigger picture of the last **2 decades**, you then see Republicans only had a measly 1-term stint of 4 years with a Republican President, sandwiched in between **16 years of Dem Presidents.**\n\nKnow why *this* is important?\n\nTrump:\n\n1. Will not simply opt-out of running for President for 2028. 0 chance this happens. Even his supporters mostly agree. They know \"the game\" by this point and have been honest (from what I've been reading) about their estimations for 2028's run. They are (seemingly) around 80% to 90% fully understanding that Trump **will** be the candidate for the next run. For the 2020 election, he had started sending in the official paperwork, etc. to run for President **on the very first day it was possible that anyone could sign up and do the paperwork**. No other Presidential candidate has ever done that. He did this because he \"lets out trial balloons\" (feels things out ahead of time in a type of \"testing the waters\" way) and he figured **that** specific \"trial balloon\" would be beneficial to him *no matter what circumstances surround him because he can always rescind or double down later. It's a \"back pocket\" thing for him.*\n2. This is **going to** result in Trump being the candidate for 2028 when he will be **82** and even WAY more gone than he is currently. This is going to drag the Republican party into further depths considering, if Trump loses THIS time....I mean his \"brand\" is going to start getting a ton of their supporters to be very resentful towards their own party. They want to **win**, and they are perfectly fine with whining and bitching....as long as it gets them to have their way. If you keep getting them pissed off, but you then also can't **ever** deliver....I mean Trump's candidacy for 2028 is going to be **Armageddon for the Republican party.** They're only going to call \"fraud\" for as long as it feels (to them) like it \"might possibly work\". Don't underestimate their understanding of what they, themselves, do. They're fully aware that Trump didn't win in 2020, but they had seen him lie about everything under the sun **before that** and that he wound up skating away from consequences nearly each and every time, so they figure \"the ends justify the means\", so as such they just resort to lying. So, they figure if it gets them what they want, they'll lie too. *Voting in Harris/Walz is the literal best possible way to tell Trump to fuck off*.\n3. IF Dems can either take the house or keep the Senate (or, miraculously, do both of those things)....I mean there is going to be some SERIOUS infighting with Republicans. Which will then help Democrats to divide Republicans. Best part, THAT division will be self-inflicted. We don't even have to do anything **except; WIN.**\n\nIf we win, we can make sure this all happens. I don't know about you, but I want to be part of history, I want to be a part of how it is we drove out a chaotic, piece of human trash, mango-tinted shit stain.\n\nThis is the ONE AND ONLY thing Trump would EVER \"lower himself\" to ask of anyone and it's only because the choice of who wins is not up to him.\n\nHe won't have that problem in 2028 if he wins. **That will be OUR problem**.\n\nTrump's only true skill = outsourcing problems to people who (bafflingly) are willing to simply....take it on as their responsibility for him. Even when they know it's a crime. Even when they know it won't work. They still do it.\n\nSo, as such, we need to make **US** *be* his problem. Vote Harris/Walz. Start the downward spiral of the Republican party. If they lose this election, **that party is going to be absolutely shattered and isn't that precisely what we've been wanting for a long, long time?

But I\u2019m scared as hell\n\nEdit 2\n\nThe other reason I\u2019m slightly optimistic about NC is that Robinson is a trash candidate and is going to lose big time I\u2019ve heard maybe by as high as 20 points, let\u2019s say half slit their tickets that 10% of their vote for use and even half that 5% would be all we need to take it\n\nThis is why Trump is spending his final days in NC, the split ticket % is going to be epic even for Nc which is no stranger to split tickets",

He's nothing new- and we've seen his tricks already that he has done nothing to update. Kamala however, IS new. She's different. SHE has the biggest rallies. Also we have experienced the consequences of Trump's actions and most of us really don't like it.",

Once Laura Trump took control of the RNC, the Republican Party's money became Trump's money, and he won't spend his own money on lawyers.\n\nIMO Trump's legal options to overturn a 2024 loss are significantly smaller than in 2020 when he was the outgoing president and other people were footing the bill. His followers are going to be really confused and pissed at him when he doesn't fight as hard as he's promised.\n\nI think he leaves the country to somewhere nice and warm without an extradition treaty and just plays golf and trash talks America for the rest of his days.",

There's more.) The third time it plays, you're thinking maybe someone's playing \"What's New Pussycat\" again. The fourth time it plays you're thinking, \"Whoa.

And they banked everything on running against Biden, but made the dramatic mistake of suggesting he should drop out while not realizing what would happen if the dog actually caught the car. They didn't anticipate how quickly the Democrats were willing to pivot, or that Harris would prove to be a much less divisive figure among Democrats than they thought (they vaguely remembered the 2020 primaries and were under the impression that people still cared about the 'Kopmala' stuff, when even people like me who loathed her at the time don't give a flying fuck anymore). And then their immediate response was a really transparent 'NO FAIR' that did nothing to improve the campaign's image and kind of laid bare how cynical the concern about Biden was. Plus Trump immediately showed how senile he was. and then they reacted badly to Walz. And then they didn't leash Vance at all and let him make three or more gaffes a week. \n\nand they should have told state Republicans to ease up on the abortion restrictions this year. That would have been smart because if Trump won, they could freely do as much as they wanted, but continuing to go hard on it now made the issue perpetually salient to female voters.

I thought everyone that should have voted for Hillary will have learned their lesson and 2020 would be a blowout. But of course, we have goldfish memories and narrow minded vision, so moderates thought since the country wasn't burning, we might be ok with him and almost got him a second term. \n\nBoth of those elections proved that being comfortable with vibes and polls, means ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. The only thing that seems to work is everyone putting in massive effort, and not letting the bad news distract you. We have a shit ton of positives in our favor: first major election since Jan 6, first major election since roe overturned, larger crowd sizes, way more visible enthusiasm, a positive and hopeful candidate versus a vindictive, boring, meandering, disgusting candidate, and many more! What have we learned about positive data? Absolutely nothing. The only way I'll be confident in the enthusiasm, is if we absolutely destroy him tomorrow. Anything else is a disappointing reveal of my country's failures in recent years.\n\nI think that's why everyone's on edge. We've been here before, the polling was wrong in his favor, and now we're apparently tied with no indication either way whether the polling is wrong in either direction. Historical results have chipped away at our confidence, and now a tiny victory seems almost like a loss.

And you have to pray that burgers manages to just barely eke out a win, or we're all eating junkie shit.\n\nThe fact that this is even *remotely* a close decision makes me weep for humanity.",
         "A coup, exactly.  There was no legal way for Trump to stay in office.  \n\nTrump is really saying that he wishes that his followers had engaged even more bloodshed and that he had established martial law.  B/c he couldn\u2019t have stayed in office any other way.",

         "Not going to happen.  That very moment was supposed to happen after Romney, a rich cis, white male and former governor lost to Obama, a relative newcomer to politics.\n\nThe presumption was that the republican party would take steps to marginalize its extreme elements (i.e. the racists, nationalists and radical evangelicals), but they quickly realized that the extreme elements had become the plurality in their party and that many independents and centrists weren't buying the crap they were selling due to the grotesqueries of the propaganda machine (Fox News, Limbaugh, etc) associated with the party.\n\n  \nThe viability of teaching out to the center died on the vine when Jeb Bush failed to secure the nomination.   Republicans knew that they had lost the popular vote 3 out of the last 4 times at that point and that the stops had to be pulled out in order to energize whatever base was rallying behind Trump.  Well, it worked for one term.\n\n  \nFast forward to today.  The GOP has been amping up its voters on divisive rhetoric and extremism for almost an entire decade at this point.  So much so that they attacked a government building trying to assault the legislative branch of government.   It took \\~6 years for the Tea party to morph into the MAGA movement and it will take at least as long to start the process of reckoning what the platform will be going forward.\n\n  \nIts become clear to me that the oligopolists would rather financially support fascism rather than try to build a 3rd party up from the ground.  Its going to take a long time for those relationships and attitudes to languish, and I don't ever expect the MAGA voters to abandon what has become a cult/religion for them.   These people are stuck with each other for a long time.    Folks like DeSantis and Cruz and other copycats will try to rebuild Trump's coalition in order to win the nomination.\n\n  \nNot that I really like 'traditional' republicans very much, but they don't have the numbers, money or willpower to turn back the clock on what the party has become.",

Biden got 3.45 million votes in 2020, so to reach that same number, Democrats need to get about 2.4 million election-day votes tomorrow.\n\nAnd considering that the 2020 election-day vote (in PA) split 80-40 for Trump, tomorrow could make the result *very* close.",

You also need to account for Republicans going Harris, which may be a lot higher than Republicans who went for Biden. Plus Independents, etc. You are literally doing nothing but throwing numbers as if 2020 and 2024 exist in a bubble, and everyone only votes on party lines.",

         "The Character and Eligibility of Donald Trump: A Critical Examination.\n\nThis paper examines Donald Trump\u2019s character and constitutional eligibility to serve as president, focusing on the disqualification clause in the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. A central argument is that his impeachment by Congress unequivocally establishes his ineligibility, as he engaged in insurrection on January 6th, 2021. He conspired with others to have Vice President Pence reject state-certified electors and incited his supporters into rebellion. Under the Constitution, such actions disqualify him from holding public office, mirroring historical precedents where Congress or governors have refused to certify the elections of individuals deemed by them to be insurrectionists. America\u2019s most esteemed presidents, like George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, are celebrated not only for their leadership but for their unwavering integrity and commitment to democratic principles. Washington\u2019s humility and dedication set the foundational values of the nation, while Lincoln\u2019s moral conviction preserved its unity during its most perilous times. In stark contrast, Trump\u2019s conduct\u2014both during his tenure and specifically on January 6th\u2014reveals a profound deficiency in character. His reckless and divisive actions pose a direct threat to the very fabric of democracy. This paper argues that, based on constitutional mandates and the essential qualities required of a president, Trump\u2019s character and actions categorically disqualify him from the presidency, irrespective of policy positions or partisan affiliations.\n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/384473246_The_Character_and_Eligibility_of_Donald_Trump_A_Critical_Examination/stats",

         "The Character and Eligibility of Donald Trump: A Critical Examination.\n\nThis paper examines Donald Trump\u2019s character and constitutional eligibility to serve as president, focusing on the disqualification clause in the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. A central argument is that his impeachment by Congress unequivocally establishes his ineligibility, as he engaged in insurrection on January 6th, 2021. He conspired with others to have Vice President Pence reject state-certified electors and incited his supporters into rebellion. Under the Constitution, such actions disqualify him from holding public office, mirroring historical precedents where Congress or governors have refused to certify the elections of individuals deemed by them to be insurrectionists. America\u2019s most esteemed presidents, like George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, are celebrated not only for their leadership but for their unwavering integrity and commitment to democratic principles. Washington\u2019s humility and dedication set the foundational values of the nation, while Lincoln\u2019s moral conviction preserved its unity during its most perilous times. In stark contrast, Trump\u2019s conduct\u2014both during his tenure and specifically on January 6th\u2014reveals a profound deficiency in character. His reckless and divisive actions pose a direct threat to the very fabric of democracy. This paper argues that, based on constitutional mandates and the essential qualities required of a president, Trump\u2019s character and actions categorically disqualify him from the presidency, irrespective of policy positions or partisan affiliations.\n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/384473246_The_Character_and_Eligibility_of_Donald_Trump_A_Critical_Examination/stats",

(The other poster who pointed out that the bell-curve extends beyond the edges of the MoE is also correct.)\n\nHowever, one key thing to remember is that MoE \\*only\\* measures random sampling error, and assumes that the sample drawn reflects a perfectly random sample (like drawing marbles out of a bag). MoE was a really useful measurement back in the days when survey response rates were over 50%, because a poll behaved a lot like a random sample. Now, it's much less useful because response rates are so low and likely non-representative. Pollsters have attempted to correct for low response rates by ensuring that their their samples demographically fit what they think turnout will be (using quotas to make sure their survey fits the electorate, and/or adjusting the weights of different demographics after). However, this process can be prone to error because it relies on pollsters making assumptions about turnout. MoE does not at all address errors from assumptions made about turnout, or non-representative samples.",
         "This has been confusing me as well. Fivethirtyeight is forecasting a 50/50 split on EVs with Trump slightly ahead, but their 95% confidence band is centered roughly on Harris 300, Trump 238.

The MOE doesn't mean that the result is *absolutely* within those margins. It means that that the MOE range contains the true result with the confidence level given.\n\nSo a 95% CI with a 60 +/- 3% MOE, means that there's a 95% chance that the true result is within 57 to 63.",
         "The MoE is really the Standard deviation one might expect if the \"experiment\" of the poll was run over and over again.  In this case, about 69% of the results would fall within 3.5 points on either side.  So if a poll shows Trump up 2, if you rant that poll a thousand more times, you'd expect that 690 of the results would give anything from Haris  by 1.5 to Trump by 5.5.\n\nThat leaves the universe of the other 30% which would be more than one SD outside.

The example vantage gives is that historically Senate and Presidential voting are highly correlated, and polling has historically reflected that, but this year the Presidential polling is completely uncorrelated to the Senate polling.\n\nWe're also seeing massive turnout pretty much everywhere, which historically is good for Dems, and the GOP has outsourced their canvassing to paid groups which are imploding. \n\nHigh turnout, minimal GOP ground game, and suspect pro-Trump polling point toward a Harris win.

I was envisioning the same exact result you are worried about.

And her pick of Walz was a master stroke for NOT repeating the rust belt failures of \u201816.\n\nHarris has proven to be orders of magnitude more likable and in-touch than Hillary. More charismatic, and more talented as a politician. I really can\u2019t identify any of Hillary\u2019s failed 2016 strategies and tactics in anything Harris has done since receiving the nomination.\n\nTherefore, whatever happens tomorrow, this is not a 2016 rerun. I can assure you of that much. \n\nObjectively, not just me subjectively, Harris has run a very good campaign. Maybe even an \u201cexcellent\u201d campaign.

How do you factor in a variable you can't know the number of? Adjusting data to try to make it fit a target literally makes it biased and irrelevant no matter which way that skew tilts. You take the data you have and report it, that's it. It shouldn't be any different from any other survey.\u00a0I think polling is falling victim to what I call the stock market effect, where it's a simple concept that's made to sound more complicated than it is by the people that profit from it.\n\n\n\nBut, the biggest problem with polling is that people forget it's probability. It's an educated guess. People need to stop taking them as infallible gospel.",

Not speaking more directly to those concerns and separating from Biden, I fear is a bigger deal than dems want to accept.

While the admin is doing things, it hasn\u2019t broken through nor have any responses to his rhetoric and simplistic ideas.\n\nAlso, she didn\u2019t address trade and Trump hammers on it. His tariffs are a bad idea but you have to explain why we still kept the Trump tariffs or what you will do to improve trade. A lot of people see it as an issue that affects their ability to get good manufacturing jobs. Not talking about it vs. Trump was a mistake.\n\nAll in all, the biggest issue I see is the campaign made it more about him and how unfit he is. While I agree, you aren\u2019t changing minds with that sadly. People are responding to the economy and immigration; you don\u2019t need to convince those that see democracy as the biggest concern. \u201cTrump bad\u201d is so tempting but I\u2019m not convinced it\u2019s going to work. \n\nAnyway, I\u2019m preparing for him to win. I think that polls are underestimating his support and all he needs is Pennsylvania, which is too close polling wise. While this forum has a lot of theories about herding or \u201cjunk polls,\u201d I\u2019m not convinced- he\u2019s still too close and I think he takes the state and with it the presidency.\n\nObviously, love to be wrong and Kamala has run a very good campaign, but I just think \u201cchange\u201d is going to be what people want and they aren\u2019t paying attention to the rest of his bs.

If they are sampling and adjusting based on 2020 then the backlash against Dobbs is not going to be represented.\n\n\nYou're right about the \"See we were right\" thing though.

         ">Danielle Butterfield, executive director of the Democratic Super PAC Priorities USA\n\nOk this is a great name for a PAC. \n\n>none other than Stephen Miller believes that the racist joke at Trump\u2019s Madison Square Garden rally, which compared Puerto Rico to a pile of garbage, was a \u201chuge unforced error\u201d \n\n>Butterfield: A really big difference between people hearing Trump\u2019s words and Trump\u2019s allies words in this context is that ***they have a retrospective understanding of not just his words but his actions*** and how the two can be really related to each other. When we heard messaging at the MSG rally last week, there was a really easy ability to then connect that to how he handled certain situations when he was president. ***It\u2019s not just a flippant joke but a representation of how he actually acted.*** For example, we\u2019re running an ad right now targeting Puerto Rican voters in partnership with Somos Votantes across the battleground, particularly in Pennsylvania, that really ties together the joke about Puerto Rico being an island of trash up against how Trump handled Hurricane Maria. That ad is testing really well amongst Latino voters, in particular Puerto Rican voters, because it reminds them, and it really contextualizes, ***that this isn\u2019t just words, it\u2019s his actions.*** That\u2019s a really big shift that we\u2019re seeing this year in terms of our ability to show Trump\u2019s impact. \n\n>One other thing that we are seeing is that ***young voters are hearing audio from Trump\u2019s Billy Bush interview where he said grab them by the p-word\u2014they\u2019re hearing that for the first time this year***, even though it leaked originally in the 2016 cycle. This is really important because these voters who are voting for the first time in 2024 were 10, 11 years old when Trump was first elected in 2016. So when these voters are hearing this horrible sound and this horrible audio interview from Trump with his graphic depiction of how he views women, they\u2019re hearing it in the context of him being proud of overturning Roe v. Wade. The context of how his words have actually had a disastrous impact, it\u2019s just landing a lot differently in this cycle.\n\n>It certainly felt good to see that Iowa polls, particularly her numbers with white suburban women and older voters. Even if we don\u2019t win in Iowa, it\u2019s a signal that we\u2019re going to do well in the upper Midwest. It\u2019s a great sign of what\u2019s to come for Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania. But it doesn\u2019t change our strategy. Neither of these polls change our strategy at this point, which is that we need to continue to persuade and mobilize these voters in the final stretch. ***The thing that doesn\u2019t necessarily get reported as much is that we\u2019re doing it with such joy.*** Seeing all these Harris volunteers out on the doors with their rogue merch that they made at home and their friendship bracelets and having just an amazing back and forth on SNL last night about Harris\u2019s ability to drive joy in this final stretch.

I feel like every interview with an \"undecided\" voter that you see on the news is someone who knows damn well who they are voting for, and has for a long time, they just want their 5 minutes of fame on CNN.\n\nOverall I feel like this is an aspect of the election that is driving the very bad polling and herding phenomena we're seeing. Polling models make some big assumptions about undecideds and their propensity to vote. In this election cycle though, I think that in reality very very very little of America is or has been undecided for a long time. As soon as Trump made it official that he was running again I think that close to 100% of the public that was ever going to vote was decided. Maybe a chunk of Biden voters waffled a bit when they saw him visibly deteriorating in the first debate, but that was completely cured by him dropping out and being replaced by Harris.\n\nIt just doesn't make logical sense. Show me a person who honestly voted for Biden in 2020 but now wants to vote for Trump. Maybe you can find a handful of people but I think that it's very obvious that the opposite scenario is more likely. So I don't buy any of these polls showing \"a dead heat.\" Trump is a known quantity and the majority of Americans despise hearing his name at this point and want him to go away. More than anything, this election is going to come down to that. I believe Harris is going to win very soundly and we wont have to wait days for the results.",

         "Astonishingly, people aren\u2019t flocking to support a candidate who, by all appearances, embodies every quality one would avoid in a leader. After all, who wouldn\u2019t want a head of state with an impressive record of *indictments on multiple felony counts*? In August 2023, for example, a federal grand jury indicted Donald on four felony charges tied to efforts to overturn the 2020 election\u2014a shocking but strangely fitting credential for someone claiming to defend democracy (U.S. News Staff, 2024).\n\nOr take the candidate\u2019s $5 million liability for sexual abuse and defamation\u2014another feat few could achieve, awarded by a New York jury in May 2023 for abusing writer E. Jean Carroll (U.S. News Staff, 2024). But perhaps nothing quite displays \u201cpresidential qualifications\u201d like a 37-count indictment for mishandling classified documents. After all, who wouldn\u2019t entrust national security to someone facing federal charges for obstructing justice with sensitive government secrets (U.S. News Staff, 2024)?\n\nYet, somehow, the irony only deepens. Donald has accused opponents of corruption and dishonesty, rallying a base that seems blind to the glaring accusations of *fraudulent business practices and tax evasion* directed at him. Multiple investigations have scrutinized his finances, revealing practices that, for most of us, would mean not just a loss of reputation but likely bankruptcy and financial ruin (U.S. News Staff, 2024). And speaking of bankruptcies, Donald's businesses have filed for protection several times, raising questions about his financial savvy and business ethics (Bennett, 2022).\n\nHere\u2019s where the propaganda model, as outlined by Noam Chomsky, fits neatly into the picture. Chomsky noted how influential figures deflect their faults by accusing others of what they are guilty of. Donald doesn\u2019t just deny these accusations\u2014he turns them into proof of his victimhood, claiming to be the one true patriot under attack by a corrupt establishment. This is propaganda at its finest: flipping accusations into badges of honor and reframing felony indictments and court rulings as evidence of a larger conspiracy (Chomsky, 1988).\n\nThe propaganda machine doesn\u2019t stop there. Donald frequently promotes baseless conspiracy theories, eroding public trust and creating a reality in which his supporters see every indictment and investigation not as a disqualifying offense but as \u201cproof\u201d that he\u2019s \u201ctelling it like it is\u201d (Petersen, 2024). This tactic shifts the narrative so effectively that supporters come to view even allegations of *discriminatory housing practices*\u2014like the Department of Justice lawsuit for racial discrimination against his real estate company\u2014as part of an elaborate plot against him (Bennett, 2022).\n\nDrawing parallels to historical figures, it's noteworthy how leaders like Guatemala's Carlos Castillo Armas, Nicaragua's Anastasio Somoza, and Venezuela's Nicol\u00e1s Maduro have risen to power. These leaders often employed divisive rhetoric, portraying themselves as saviors against perceived threats while consolidating power through undemocratic means. Notably, U.S. involvement has played a role in the ascent of some of these figures. For instance, the CIA orchestrated the 1954 coup in Guatemala, leading to Castillo Armas's rule (Wikipedia contributors, 2024). Similarly, the U.S. supported the Somoza dynasty in Nicaragua for decades (Timeline of US-Latin American Relations since 1823, n.d.). Chomsky's analysis highlights how propaganda and external backing can facilitate the rise of such leaders, drawing concerning parallels to current political dynamics.\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nChomsky, N.

They're disengaged, not undecided.\n\nDisengaged voters, in my experience, aren't apathetic out of disinterest, but disillusionment. Many have lost trust in the powerful institutions that structure our society - whether government, media, schools, corporations, or all of the above - and, as a result, don't believe that they, who would see things remade in a very different way, can ever hope to be truly heard. It\u2019s not a lack of awareness or of concern but a response to feeling consistently let down and overpowered by our society. I think this kind of apathy is rooted in a deeper sense of hopelessness: a belief that the system is broken beyond repair and a belief that individual voices simply can't make a difference because of that.",

The polling and media trends tracking the performance for the candidates just never seemed to reflect realistic conditions of how people would be approaching this election. The only period where I felt like we started getting genuine reads on the public polling was right around after Kamala became the candidate.\n\nWhen you look at all the factors heading into this election and how either campaign handled themselves, it should have been obvious that Trump was on a major back foot the whole time. He came into the election as a loser and a very viscerally disliked man by a huge portion of the country and proceeded to do nothing at all to court people to his side.\n\nSure he\u2019d say stuff here and there that vocal morons would lean to and there would be plenty of bad media on whatever new supposed blunder Democrats would say, but he never was able to push major policy or ideas that would bring in a large demographic he didn\u2019t already have.\n\nIf all you did was follow the election on Twitter then yeah it seemed so so close. On paper though, Republicans have probably run the worst campaign in modern American history while also coming into the election with a proven loser with an explicit political resume now that he didn\u2019t have last time he actually won.",

The former national security advisor John Bolton, for example, said Trump once asked whether Finland was part of Russia.\n> \n> Similarly, Trump's former White House chief of staff Gen. John Kelly also once said Trump \"doesn't know any history at all, even some of the basics on the US,\" says Hill's new book, \"There Is Nothing for You Here: Finding Opportunity in the Twenty-First Century,\" which was published last year.\n> \n> In the book, Hill writes that Trump's meager comprehension of international affairs was a \"major liability\" for US national security.\n> \n> \"Whenever he got to meetings and the conversation started, it seemed like the first time he was hearing things from world leaders,\" she writes.",

This is a long known issue and the media has consistently tweaked large national polls this way (if the sample has a disproportionate number of D v R, they will skew the numbers to match the population). This dilutes independent voters who actually make up about 1/3 of the voting population. Independents almost always end up favoring one candidate over another and this gets factored out in these polls. The second reason which is unique to the last two cycles is that Republicans and Trump have spent millions on public polls (polls where the results are released to the public) to shift the polling in their favor by a few points. This is why there was a Red Mirage in 2022 and Republicans had a historically bad year. Trump alone has spent millions on these polls this year and more than half the swing state polls consumed by 538 are polls he paid for.",
         "I\u2019m with you that someone is trying to keep it close but also reminded that before Biden dropped out the polls showed Trump building a lead and it was partly this polling that motivated Biden to hand the baton to Kamala.

Because neck and neck encourages young people to get out and vote and further gets the Uncommitteds and othet disenchanted leftists to not risk a vote on Stein or a similar grifter. But it also sets up Trump's argument that she CAN'T possibly win, that's not what polls say! So we still have a problem.",
         "There is a well established, symbiotic relationship between politicians, pollsters, and the media. \n\nSome of it is that, for both sides, there is an incentive to cook the numbers to make it appear as a close race, because it keeps voter motivation and engagement high, regardless of what their internal data actually suggests. Like you said. That\u2019s probably one of the biggest parts. \n\nAnother group is the other ones you mentioned, the ones who don\u2019t want to look bad or lose credibility by making a bold prediction and being wrong. They would rather make generic predictions in line with what everyone else is saying, even if they end up being wrong, because it doesn\u2019t hurt them so much when literally everyone got it wrong. \n\nReally though, there is little incentive for anyone involved to tell the actual truth of what their data is telling them unless their candidate is already almost a certain bet and they believe that they are close enough to the election that opinion and outcome aren\u2019t likely to change. \n\nThat\u2019s why we are suddenly seeing all the last minute polls agree on this \u2018out-of-the-blue\u2019 surge for Harris. It doesn\u2019t matter anymore, because Trump is fucked and nothing will change that. And, even if that did change, and he won, the numbers wouldn\u2019t really make any sense because they were already bs anyways. They\u2019d just come out and say that it was a crazy fluke no one could have predicted. \n\nBasically, a lot of how they make their decisions is based on two general things: partisan strategy\u2026 and maintaining their own credibility, with the latter usually being the priority. \n\nThey do whatever they have to to appear legit, the media waves it around to give their own narratives legitimacy, and then, if it\u2019s favorable anyhow, candidates get to brag about their poll numbers to their supporters. It\u2019s a win-win-win scenario.",

         "The situation you're describing is unfortunately likely the worst in the short-term. If the pollsters indeed did adjust the numbers to be closer, and it actually ends up being a landslide in her favor, all it will take is Trump saying it is \"evidence\" for fraud before the violence starts, and I don't think it's going to be limited to the capitol this time.\n\n\nLong term, it might be the best, but we won't get there without yet another historic black eye.",

Still I'm hopeful on PA, so we can just call it a night.",

Equally importantly is that the PA Dems have been putting them to use when they\u2019re here and not just letting them sit on their thumbs.\n\nFolks have come from overseas, including the manager of the Northwest Philadelphia campaign office who has lived in London for 30 years and told me it was too important to not let this get fucked up so she came back to work this last one.\n\nIs this dispositive question who knows but we are cautiously nauseously optimistic here in RoxYunk. \n\nIf you happen to be in Philly, and want to say hello, I\u2019ll be holding down the 21st 12th division voting table at North Light community Center.

I look around the porch thinking maybe I got a delivery and see a Trump flyer on my door handle. I pick it up, look at the driver who is staring at me. He doesn\u2019t initiate anything. I don\u2019t have any signs in my yard so by all means he doesn\u2019t know who I\u2019m supporting but the dude just doesn\u2019t bother. I lift the flyer up, march to my trashcan and throw it away.

But the relevant law was updated in 2022.  The threshold to maintain such an objection was raised significantly and the process for such objections were tightened immensely.  There is little to fear here.\n\nThe article you linked provides ample meat for those who must get their fix on fear.  But what it suggests is that the law does not matter because people will simply sue to overturn it.  The antidote here is to reflect upon the success ratio of Team Trump in the courts as it pertains to this sort of nonsense of the Big Lie.  Although folk can point out some of the recent actions from SCOTUS as benefitting Trump, his overall track record with SCOTUS is abysmal.  Furthermore, despite dozens of lawsuits stemming from the 2020 election, Team Trump won almost a clean zero from all of that.",

So if they lose solidly this time, there's a good chance they're stuck out in the wilderness long enough for most of the rest of the boomers to die off.\n\nThat's why we're going to see an absolute balls to the wall effort this year to stay in power no matter what.

         "this article by Nate Silver, who has been very bullish for Trump this year is a good start in general for explaining the unprecedented degree of herding we've been seeing, along with a good explanation of what herding is and why it happens.\n\nhttps://www.natesilver.net/p/theres-more-herding-in-swing-state\n\nThe remainder, unfortunately, requires quite a bit of digging, but I'll explain my methodology if you want to repeat it.   The first thing to do is look at the demographic makeup of the early vote we're seeing coupled with earlier surveys of what groups of people are saying they are voting on election day vs early.  \n\nThen with that data in hand, compare that to the sampling methodology of the likely voter models used by the Seltzer poll versus some of the other more credible pollsters like Emerson, Ipsos, and NYT/Sienna.    \n\nWhat you'll see is that in these polls, their turnout models have two problems that have been addressed in the Seltzer poll.  One is that they haven't updated them a great deal since Biden was in the race, and I think you'd agree that Kamala is going to turn out more and different people than Biden would have.   And it's also becoming increasingly clear that the likely voter models they are using are hugely underestimating the gender gap we're going to see in the actual voting.  They're assuming the average 4-6% higher female vote that we saw in 2020 instead of the 10-12% we're actually seeing be the case.  I'm betting they're also very much  undercounting the African American vote, but I don't have as solid data on that.",
         "Yep, I call it \"Pulling a Rasmussen\"",
         "according to my understanding half of the polls out there are conducted by right leaning pollsters. Like Nate Silver said, the Iowa poll doesn't change anything, because right after that was released there's another new poll that shows Trump is winning Iowa.",
         "Yeah, I get it.  You can't swing a cat without hitting a conflicting analysis of the polls lately here.   Really, the only thing you can do is not take ANY of it very seriously right now.  The polls will either be right or they'll be wrong. And if they're wrong, it will either be in Trump's favor or Kamala's. \n\nAnd in either case, at this point the results will be what the results will be.  Vote if you haven't, get others to vote if you can.  But otherwise,  just take care of yourself and see how things turn out, and stay safe.",
         "So, is there a point attached to that link?  Mine is that the data you just linked is heavily skewed. \n\nThough actually it's also impacted by a whole other problem I haven't discussed above, which is that right wing pollsters have been flooding the zone with garbage polls favorable to Trump in order to shift the polling averages and control the narrative.",
         "Really, I think the most persuasive one is this from Nate Silver three days ago.  It doesn't make the strongest case of those available, but the fact that it's coming from someone who's been extremely bullish on Trump all year lends it weight in my opinion because you can't claim he's biased for Kamala.  https://www.natesilver.net/p/theres-more-herding-in-swing-state",
         "Really, I think that the short takeaway from all of this is that there are so many confounding factors that it's probably nearly impossible to build a halfway decent likely voter model at all.  \n\n * 2020 data is jacked as a baseline because of Covid, but it's all they really have to work with.  \n\n * The Dobbs decision is obviously going to do 'something' but it's pretty difficult to estimate how much that would impact female turnout and cross over vote, but both are critical. \n\n * There's the unprecedented political earthquake of the Democratic candidate being replaced mid-race, and that person would be the first Woman President in an election that's all about women's rights...\n\n * We have a Republican candidate that is running with 34 felony convictions and multiple other felony court cases hanging over his head.\n\n * We have the first Presidential election since the failed January 6th attempt to overthrow our government. \n\n\nLike... what the hell are you going to make of that?   I'm not sure I'd be doing much different.  At least if you predict 50/50 nobody says you predicted a win that was contrary to what happened.",
         "None of the actual internal polls have been released.  That in itself is actually a bit of a data point.  Campaigns tend to only release internal polling data if it shows there's a lot of work to do in a state, in order to motivate volunteers and voters.   The last thing they want to do is release internal polls that say they have it in the bag, because that would de-motivate their voters. \n\nAll we have as far as the internals is what we can extrapolate from the campaign's choices and the rare bits of info that insiders who are working on the campaign let slip.",
         "That's basically the short version, yes.",
         "Well,  we'll know soon enough.  \n\nWatch Iowa and North Carolina.  Both should have results fairly quickly tomorrow night, and if either of those goes blue, Trump's about to get his ass pounded.",
         "Yep.  If they have more favorable polls, it would have been political malpractice to release them.  As irritating as it is, they need the close race as much as the media does to drive turnout and get those low propensity voters to the polls.  \n\nBut yeah, there's going to be a price for that.",

And anyone who cares about this issue yet cannot get pregnant is voting against Trump as an act of empathy and solidarity with their fellow Americans' right to be alive or have bodily autonomy. And lest we forget that while this may be about ending abortion bans right now, it could down the line be about restricting other human rights down the line.",

PA, GA, and NC are the (alleged) tightest of the swing state races, so if those states are all won, other states should have even better results, with the potential for some surprising flips sprinkled into the mix as well.  \n\nIf she doesn't win PA, GA, and NC, she still has a chance at winning, but it will be a much closer nail-biter.",

A sample size of two is *nothing*. Polls also significantly overestimated Republican advantage in the 2022 midterms. The tendency toward \"herding\" toward the middle is in part a reaction by pollsters to try and shore up the data they might have missed in the last two races. Even right-leaning pollsters like Atlas, Trafalgar, and Rasmussen seems less bullish on Trump than in 2020, but I'd have to dig into the data a bit more.",

There are groups that are more likely to vote early and groups that are more likely to vote on Election Day, so to look at the part of the data we have so far, it isn\u2019t just a clean representative sample of the final voting demographics. It\u2019s quite possible that the democrats and women have done a majority of their voting early and the majority of the republicans and men waited until Election Day.

Trump's pushed for early voting this time (probably so husbands can check their wives' mail in ballot choices in you listen to some Republicans), while some Democrats are concerned about delays or challenges to their votes if they try to mail in.\n\nCovid's also not really a factor this year, which really drove up Democratic mail in voting I think (after all Republican's didn't believe Covid was a big deal).\n\nSo I think that's another reason to be slightly optimistic over the early voting numbers, but like you said, we won't know until we know.",

         "This is the article for anyone who wants to save a click.\n\nDonald Trump Has Lost His Sh*t\nThere is no \u201ccontext\u201d for performing fellatio on a microphone. He\u2019s gone batty. The only remaining question is whether enough voters recognize it.\n\nMichael TomaskyNovember 4, 2024\nDonald Trump points enthusiastically.\nI woke up Saturday morning, as you may have, to the sight of Donald Trump performing fellatio on a microphone (no, I\u2019m not linking to it). The clip that was making the rounds on X was 27 seconds. As I scrolled down, I noticed a tweet from a MAGA person scolding the non-MAGA world and offering a clip that ran to about two minutes. This \u201ccontext,\u201d this person suggested, would explain why he did this and prove once again how diabolically slanted the media was, and how unfair the world was to Trump.\n\nI watched the longer version. Um, news flash: The \u201ccontext\u201d didn\u2019t help. His mic went out. Someone handed him another one. He griped about his mic for a while. He held the working mic at his side and started to speak, I suppose demonstrating what it was like to be standing on a stage speaking without being heard, when suddenly he did that \u2026 thing he did.\n\nSo no, there is no context. There\u2019s no conceivable explanation that would leave us thinking, \u201cOh, OK, sure, so that\u2019s why he emulated a blow job. Who among us wouldn\u2019t?\u201d\n\nWell, maybe there\u2019s one.\n\nTrump is fully losing it. Watch any of his recent speeches for five minutes. He\u2019s completely incoherent. He has been this way for months, but it keeps getting worse. The only thing that\u2019s different now is that it\u2019s a news story\u2014finally!\u2014and more people are recognizing it. Also, his crowds are walking out on him now during these rambling speeches that run to an hour and a half or more.\n\nHis campaign is a mess. Over the weekend, The Atlantic published a devastating piece by Tim Alberta about the infighting in the campaign. You really should read it if you haven\u2019t, it\u2019s full of stunning details. The bottom line is as you might guess: The chaos emanates from the top.\n\nBut the most interesting thing about the Alberta piece is not any specific anecdote that appears in it. The most interesting thing about the Alberta piece is that it exists at all. That is to say, that all these key players in a presidential campaign are taking time out in the last month of the race (assuming that Alberta has been reporting the piece out for a little while) to gripe to a reporter instead of sticking to doing their jobs. It\u2019s insane.\n\nAnd you know what else it is? A sign that they\u2019re preparing for a loss. I suppose it could be argued the other way\u2014that Trump insiders are trying to ice rivals out of potential jobs in a new Trump administration. But I\u2019ve covered lots of campaigns in my day, from president to City Council. The people who are laser-focused on winning never do this kind of preelection sniping. You only get this from people who worry that they\u2019re going to lose and who don\u2019t want to be blamed so they\u2019re still considered employable. I have no doubt there are rivalries and grudges in the Harris campaign too. There always are. But we don\u2019t know about them and won\u2019t until the insider books come out. That\u2019s the key difference.\n\nSaturday was quite a day. First, the fellatio clip. Then the Alberta piece hit. And last and best, as day turned to night on the East Coast, boom, the Selzer poll out of Iowa dropped\u2014Harris ahead by three. In Iowa. Could Kamala Harris really win Iowa? Nah, went the consensus. But this poll just might be telling us something about the momentum of this race.\n\nI\u2019m going to beg to differ. It absolutely might be telling us that Harris can win Iowa. First, Selzer is universally respected. Second, maybe Selzer\u2019s polling method is a little different. Different how? Different in the way that is summarized in the headline Marcy Wheeler put on her write-up of the poll at Empty Wheel: \u201cMale Pollsters Shocked\u2014Shocked!!\u2014When a Woman Pollster Discovers Women Voters.\u201d Consider for a second the landscape in Iowa: Late last summer, one of the most draconian abortion bans in the country went into effect.\n\nIn the Selzer poll, independent women are backing Harris by 28 points. Senior women back her 63\u201328. Sit with those numbers for a second. They\u2019re staggering.\n\nCould they be wrong? Sure. But here\u2019s another question to chew on: Could the rest of the polling, which has tended to base its samples on 2020 turnout and the now-infamous \u201crecalled vote,\u201d and which is painfully concerned with undercounting Trump voters, be in fact undercounting Harris voters\u2014the women who are jazzed about her candidacy and the women (and men) who are post-Dobbs Democratic voters?\n\nWe\u2019ll find out soon enough, but the point for now is that it was a pulverizing piece of news that ended a week in Trump world that started out, you\u2019ll recall, with the fascist, racist, more-or-less-everythingist rally at Madison Square Garden. I\u2019ve been a little chagrined that coverage of that grisly event has focused almost exclusively on Tony Hinchcliffe\u2019s repulsive joke about Puerto Rico, because so many other disgusting comments were vomited out from that stage. On the other hand, that coverage has given us polls like this one, again from Saturday: Puerto Ricans in Florida prefer Harris by 85\u20138. Not a typo. There are around 1.1 million Puerto Ricans in Florida; according to Puerto Rico Report, \u201cThere are now more eligible voters from Puerto Rico in Florida than from Cuba.\u201d Harris\u2019s numbers among Latinos are up 15 points from July to October.\n\nI didn\u2019t even get to Trump\u2019s comments about women and RFK Jr. and his inability to grab a door handle. In sum: The odor that\u2019s emanating from the Trump campaign right now is one of total free fall. And Harris seems to be peaking perfectly\u2014no mistakes, totally on message; great Saturday Night Live appearance; fantastic LeBron endorsement; wonderful cameos by people like J-Lo and Alicia Keys, who made beautiful remarks over the weekend at a rally outside Philadelphia.\n\nThat\u2019s what we have on this day before Election Day: a well-run campaign with a disciplined candidate who is actually talking about people\u2019s lives, versus a Pollock canvas of a campaign led by a candidate who is both losing what remains of his marbles and stewing ever more deeply in the vinegar of his prejudices and hatreds. The only hanging question now is whether enough Americans have taken note.",

Migrants are not a problem in the United States. In fact, migrant workers can get tax codes to create bank accounts and get taxed, who are simultaneously unable to reap benefits like social security, medicade, medicare, food stamps, etc. Migrant workers contribute to our system in many ways. Work the jobs we don't want to work, pay taxes that they don't benefit from and live normal lives like the rest of us. Migrants are not violent, and do not take up housing resources or contribute to inflation. That's just a straight up lie. The rate of migrant crime is a fraction of those of American citizens.  88 percent of Fentanyl that crosses the border is caught at legal points of entry and perpetrated by American citizens. Only 8 percent is caught at \"the border\", and the includes vehicle searches at the point of entry. The Republican party uses Anti-migrant sentiment as a mechanism to divide the labor class from uniting against corporate interest. If you have a boss, you and a migrant are oppressed by the millionaire/billionaire class.\n\nI also want to heavily limit the number of guns in the US.  There are 120 firearms for every 100 civilians in the United States.  In comparison. The second highest country, Switzerland ranks second with only 28 firearms for every 100 civilians. Gun violence in Switzerland is almost unheard of, and one of the major reasons is because firearms are highly controlled. They cannot be kept in a house. They can only be stored at specified shooting ranges. Gun culture in America needs to change. A gun in America is seen as everything between a toy to a device used to save people. In reality, it is a tool designed to end life and should be respected as such. It is a FACT that gun violence and school shootings will fall dramatically if the US were to reach the gun ownership ratio to match Switzerland. Illegal guns that enter the country, and that are used on US citizens are American made. The Republican party pushes Anti-gun law messaging because the gun manufacturing industry has made a killing in profits from the blood of its customer base. It's time to reduce; our children have had enough. \n\nIf you're a Republican voter, don't vote FOR Democrats, vote AGAINST Republicans, because they don't represent your interests, they haven't made your life better. Americans will NEVER see the benefits of Republican tax cuts, because it's a pittance compared the millions gained by the fattening of the 1%.",

Outright propaganda. The term 'fake news' was gaining traction to raise awareness among the public of this phenomenon. Until Trump coopted it to refer to all the other media out there. It both diluted the ability to discuss an actual problem and primed conservatives to absolutely shut out anything that didn't fit their narrative (something people of all persuasions can be naturally good at, but Trump brought us to a unique new place of denial).",

         "Like it or not, every election from president to dog catcher is a choice between the lesser of evils. That's just the way it is.\n\nFor anyone that doesn't like Harris, consider this: Trump made hundreds of judicial appointments (some wholly unqualified), including three to the Supreme Court. The next president is likely to get at least two appointments to SCOTUS.\n\nGetting Trump reelected will badly hurt the progressive agenda. In fact, Trump poses a threat to the existence of Democracy itself.  Harris may not be the first choice of progressives, but she is light years better than Trump. \n\nThe way forward is not by choosing a great leader. The way forward is by maintaining a system with strong institutions that can preserve our democracy even despite a bad leader like Trump. Trump plans to deliberately dismantle those institutions. Harris may not be liberal enough for some, but she will not tear down the institutions supporting democracy. \n\nThe progressive resistance to Harris is based on a badly mistaken way of looking at politics and government. It boils down to Harris not passing the purity test. This is a revolutionary mentality that has never worked and never will. What works is an evolutionary mentality. We can move the country to the left incrementally. But it has to start with beating Trump. \n\nAfter Harris, we elect an even more progressive candidate. With each administration comes new career professionals, new laws, new judicial appointments, new cabinet appointments, etc.  Over time things evolve in a progressive direction.  All of this may fail if those on the left that are hopelessly ideological cannot see the truth of this and refuse to help stop Trump. Ironically, they'll blame this on Harris and the Democrats, but it's their own shortsightedness.  Getting Trump reelected will set the progressive agenda back decades and anyone that can't see that is a damned fool.\n\nI always vote progressive in the primaries. However, I refuse to throw my vote away on a third party candidate in the general election when, like it or not, this is a two-horse race. If Clinton had won in 2016, there would now be a 6-3 liberal majority on the US Supreme Court instead of the nightmare 6-3 far right majority we currently have. Women in this country became second class citizens because Clinton was not elected. We cannot afford to be obsessed with progressive purity or fantasize that ANY candidate we elect will be a saint. Hundreds of millions of real people got fucked over because the lesser evil lost in 2016. Let's not find out what additional injustices will be perpetrated under a second Trump term.\n\nOf course, I wish our system wasn't this broken. Obviously, I wish we had different choices. But do you seriously think Trump getting elected in 2016 and ensuring decades of a far right SCOTUS helped progressive causes? If you cannot see a difference between Trump and Harris, you're a hopeless ideologue and I wager you have the **privilege** of not being affected by the adverse consequences of your own purity-obsessed \"progressivism\" (that is, assuming you're even sincere). You people do know that progressivism means *advancing* liberal causes, right? Progresivism certainly doesn't mean moving us closer and closer to fascism.\n\nHarris is not perfect, but there is no symmetry between her and Trump. Voting for Stein or any other third party candidate serves no purpose better than it serves fascism. It is obvious that either Trump or Harris will win. It's also obvious that choosing Harris will better serve progressivism. This isn't a difficult choice at all.",

Not another status quo liberal. \n\nIt kind of amazes me that people are shocked that this race is so close.. it\u2019s because she\u2019s not even the candidate we truly need to improve the lives of working class people.

Trump winning is horrific, he will profit off it, become more powerful, sell national secrets, pack the courts.\n\nHowever I really thought by the end it would be a nice plea we could all rally behind. I\u2019ve been motivated to donate, call bank, because Harris represents hope.\n\nInstead I got \u201cI\u2019m embarrassed that the first vote I cast as an American was for Biden.\u201d So I should take away he is pandering to a voting block that doesn\u2019t exist? The protests are made up of half people that are on student visas and half young people that don\u2019t vote. So alienate the powerful older Jewish voting block?\n\nYes he made clear in his disclaimer if you are already voting for Harris this isn\u2019t for you.\n\nI just expected more from John, than spending the 11th hour begging people that care more about a country they left behind than their current one? About people that celebrated October 7th than screamed ceasefire!\n\nOliver was really successful in 2016 with Trumpf!

What, is his daughter in law going to step down from her leadership position in the RNC?\n\nTrump will run in 2028. He\u2019ll probably announce his campaign in early 2025.

The respect is lost and it will never be regained unless we do something drastic which Im sorry but Mamala aint a that kind of figure. Our imperialist nature and greed will always cast a bigger shadow than Trump. Trump was just a way for the USA to lose face and he was very very effective if you ask me. The whole country, hell the whole world ate it all up. The fact that Harris is winning by decimals is quite telling. This country isnt dumb for voting Trump or Harris, its dumb because even after all these vultures have ruined this country, the people have not yet realized what their true power is and keep moving from one corner to the next like scared little sheep anytime some politician says or does x or y. The point is they are human just like you and me and no system will ever be perfect but complacency and blind conviction will only cause more problems. I cannot trust either party and neither should you. I will not ever settle for the shit job they do. Our power is not in voting, its in our numbers and the damage we can do simply by boycotting shit we dont need and that includes shitty politicians.",

         "Hated Trump from the very beginning, but for anyone who truly cares about Gaza and Lebanon, this argument doesn't even begin to cut it. The Biden administration has deftly maintained global consensus around Israel, while accelerating the genocide (which was their policy brainchild) in a horrific manner. The Biden admin has orchestrated not just the erosion, but the elimination of all progress in humanitarian law since WWII (Israel just bombed 34 hospitals in Lebanon, did you even hear a peep about it in the news?) They way they expedite weapons shipments, yet pacify the people with false speak of working for peace, has undermined political movements for a better future. On top of that, they are overseeing the growth of the police state, and suppression of speech exposing Israeli crimes across universities, social media, and mass media. \"Left wing\" governments across Europe are following suit: the UK just arrested a holocaust survivor for speaking out against Israel yesterday.\n\nWhen the dems want to kill 100,000 people, they convince people they're trying not to, when Trump wants to do it at least he'll say it openly so people can get off their couch and protest, and he'll be less competent in the crime too. \n\nI am 100% convinced less Arabs will be slaughtered by US bombs if Trump wins, not because he cares, but because he won't be as good at it as the democratic administration.",

It will be difficult for those who have made \u201cthis\u201d their identity to ever let go of it. Many will never. \n\nI think psychedelics might help people to break out of the cycle they find themselves in. I believe they will be an important tool in the chest. \n\nIt is ugly, hateful, morally repugnant and existentially repulsive. I want to believe that in many Trumpers, a part of their subconscious knows how bad it is, but the inertia of it all is far too great to disperse without help and tools. \n\nScared as hell, I am.

But honestly, I hope someone else reads these comments and it resonates with them. I have zero desire to convince you. \n\nThis conversation feels like how you describe a trump supporter. Close minded and locked into their perspective with no desire to try or change and reach out to the other side. You'll say yeah, cause their side is crazy and I'm not wasting my time. Which is exactly what they say. Not to mention willful manipulating what I say to try make it sound like I'm saying something I'm not.",

That's one economic policy to tackle that Biden didn't get to.\n\nThere is nothing on Trump's policy docket that will even come close to positively affecting the average American as what could happen with the first four things on Harris'.",

That's what I'm talking about. \n\nBeing marginalized for your lousy behavior by your friends and family is also an influence. People don't have to endure abuse out of guilt.

He's clearly and obviously experiencing dementia already, and as soon as he does something stupid enough to justify it, the billionaires really running the GOP now are going to get rid of him \"for the sake of the country\" and start implementing their real plan.\n\nThis sounds like conspiracy silliness, and it could obviously be wrong, but to me the writing for this was on the wall as soon as the Project 2025 stuff came out and definitely after they picked that sneering asshole as a VP.",

This is big if it carries throughout the Midwest.\n\n\nFrom my own anecdotal experience in driving around the rural Midwest and other anecdotes I've seen online, rural voters have lost their enthusiasm.

There are many great women in the Republican party for him to choose as well, but he is going to have monster returns electorally among Hispanics, African Americans, and Asian Americans. He has an embarrassment of riches no matter where he goes.\"\n\nGiven that her advice seems to be all over the place, I'm not surprised Trump went with the Appalachian couch-fucker.",

         "The Character and Eligibility of Donald Trump: A Critical Examination.\n\nThis paper examines Donald Trump\u2019s character and constitutional eligibility to serve as president, focusing on the disqualification clause in the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. A central argument is that his impeachment by Congress unequivocally establishes his ineligibility, as he engaged in insurrection on January 6th, 2021. He conspired with others to have Vice President Pence reject state-certified electors and incited his supporters into rebellion. Under the Constitution, such actions disqualify him from holding public office, mirroring historical precedents where Congress or governors have refused to certify the elections of individuals deemed by them to be insurrectionists. America\u2019s most esteemed presidents, like George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, are celebrated not only for their leadership but for their unwavering integrity and commitment to democratic principles. Washington\u2019s humility and dedication set the foundational values of the nation, while Lincoln\u2019s moral conviction preserved its unity during its most perilous times. In stark contrast, Trump\u2019s conduct\u2014both during his tenure and specifically on January 6th\u2014reveals a profound deficiency in character. His reckless and divisive actions pose a direct threat to the very fabric of democracy. This paper argues that, based on constitutional mandates and the essential qualities required of a president, Trump\u2019s character and actions categorically disqualify him from the presidency, irrespective of policy positions or partisan affiliations.\n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/384473246_The_Character_and_Eligibility_of_Donald_Trump_A_Critical_Examination/stats",

Kaplan argued that this feature would lead conservatives to accuse Facebook of bias.[7][5] Kaplan also reportedly advocated on behalf of Breitbart News and the Daily Caller within Facebook.[5][6] Kaplan has helped to place conservatives in key positions in the leadership of Facebook.[3]\n\nIn 2018, he advocated strongly for the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh.[21] Kaplan sat behind Kavanaugh during his Senate confirmation hearings.[21]",

The Dems may remain as a puppet opposition with no real power- but that\u2019s the reality. The GOP needs to be burned to the ground and the rightwing media apparatus needs to go with it. We cannot keep playing these games with false information and a party obviously bought by foreign entities.\n\nIf the Dems can keep a strong lead and message \u2014 which really needs to rally around bringing people who felt left out into the fray\u2014 which Walz does incredibly well, we can combat this and join the rest of the world by splitting the Dems and progressives and having real elections that aren\u2019t based around a precipice into authoritarianism.",

This will involve threats and acts of violence against them and their families, direct attacks on or bombing of storage locations, burning ballot drop boxes, etc.\n\n3. ***Legislative Preemption:*** Convincing the state legislatures that they have a constitutional right to appoint the states electors in the manor of their choosing, and nowhere in federal law or the constitution does it say they can\u2019t simply disregard the vote.  This has sort of been tested before SCOTUS on related topics like gerrymandering.\n\nAll three of these approaches have been tested, all three are *openly* talked about.  I think our next \u201c1/6\u201d is now just a few days away from starting, not two months.\n\nThe coming investigation and the number of trials and convictions that will flow from 11/5 through 12/25 will likely dwarf 1/6/20 by an order of magnitude.  Instead of 2,000 prosecutions that have taken 4 years, we\u2019ll be facing 20,000 or more prosecutions.

He does not have the power that he once did and is not directly in charge of the system and its levers of power.\n\n*Why* do you think he looks so goddamn depressed? *Why* do you think he's whining about how \"he should never have left the White House?\" Big change from the smug asshole bragging at MSG about his secret with the traitorous Mike Johnson.\n\nHe probably found out that not only is he going to lose bigly tomorrow, but he will not have the numbers in Congress necessary to force any last minute shenanigans.

Their goal isn't to get legitimate vote registrants but rather to get as many random people signed up as possible. Then they mail those in on deadline day with the expectation that officials would be too busy to double check, and then when the dubious names appear on the voter's rolls, they request ballots, and fraud occurs.\n\nMy guess is based on what happened in the 2020 election in Muskegon, Michigan, when a Democrat-funded group dropped off thousands of fake registrations in ONE DAY at the Clerk's office with the same handwriting, counterfeit signatures, made-up addresses, etc. The FBI is still investigating, aka covering it up.\n\nThe fact that these things are being caught & announced BEFORE the election is very good news.\"\n\n\nTHIS is what Elon is letting run rampant on his platform...abunch of conspiracy & lies to get these right wing batshit crazy people thinking it's stolen again...",

When we heard messaging at the MSG rally last week, there was a really easy ability to then connect that to how he handled certain situations when he was president. ***It\u2019s not just a flippant joke but a representation of how he actually acted.*** For example, we\u2019re running an ad right now targeting Puerto Rican voters in partnership with Somos Votantes across the battleground, particularly in Pennsylvania, that really ties together the joke about Puerto Rico being an island of trash up against how Trump handled Hurricane Maria. That ad is testing really well amongst Latino voters, in particular Puerto Rican voters, because it reminds them, and it really contextualizes, ***that this isn\u2019t just words, it\u2019s his actions.*** That\u2019s a really big shift that we\u2019re seeing this year in terms of our ability to show Trump\u2019s impact. \n\n>One other thing that we are seeing is that ***young voters are hearing audio from Trump\u2019s Billy Bush interview where he said grab them by the p-word\u2014they\u2019re hearing that for the first time this year***, even though it leaked originally in the 2016 cycle. This is really important because these voters who are voting for the first time in 2024 were 10, 11 years old when Trump was first elected in 2016. So when these voters are hearing this horrible sound and this horrible audio interview from Trump with his graphic depiction of how he views women, they\u2019re hearing it in the context of him being proud of overturning Roe v. Wade. The context of how his words have actually had a disastrous impact, it\u2019s just landing a lot differently in this cycle.\n\n>It certainly felt good to see that Iowa polls, particularly her numbers with white suburban women and older voters. Even if we don\u2019t win in Iowa, it\u2019s a signal that we\u2019re going to do well in the upper Midwest. It\u2019s a great sign of what\u2019s to come for Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania. But it doesn\u2019t change our strategy. Neither of these polls change our strategy at this point, which is that we need to continue to persuade and mobilize these voters in the final stretch. ***The thing that doesn\u2019t necessarily get reported as much is that we\u2019re doing it with such joy.*** Seeing all these Harris volunteers out on the doors with their rogue merch that they made at home and their friendship bracelets and having just an amazing back and forth on SNL last night about Harris\u2019s ability to drive joy in this final stretch. That\u2019s giving me a lot of hope.",

This conspiracy theory (about Biden and Burisma) is why Trump was impeached the first time. He threatened to withhold funds from Ukraine if they didn't investigate Joe's dealings with Burisma. So basically, the whole thing was an attempt to discredit the first impeachment of Trump, and also find anything to impeach Biden for.

To my knowledge that $67 million is more than the living members of the Bidens families worth combined. So Joe sold influence while he could have gained partnership with a country club and made the exact same money, legally.\n\nOf course the MAGAs think the Bidens have way, way, way more bribe money hidden in hidden accounts.",

Why are we giving a felon and sex offender a shot back at the White House? What is America doing? I wish we\u2019d screw our heads back on and use basic 5th grade critical thinking skills and see that this election shouldn\u2019t even be happening, because Trump shouldn\u2019t even be on the ballot. this will NEVER make sense to me.

It\u2019s not that small a thing and it would be SO.dang.good to have something like this to celebrate and be proud about (even if that pride is small right now).\n\nEspecially for the young. For all the Gen Zs and now even the Alphas.\n\nI know that the country is in rough shape (maybe not so bad in global/economic standing but definitely so in a lot of other things that do also matter) and I know that Gen Z and the young today are very aware and recognizing of this (much more so than the previous generations were) and not feeling especially proud of their country\u2026 which is precisely why we need to be able to celebrate making it to 250.\n\nBecause if the democracy for which the U.S. stands can make it, then we have **a chance** to start or keep working toward more things that they, that we all, can be proud about. Not like the old \u2018Murica pride that my generation grew up with, but pride in things that really are special and better.\n\nIt\u2019s a chance at better and yeah, maybe a chance doesn\u2019t sound like much (it really doesn\u2019t feel like much) but, honestly, unfortunately, all good things take work. (The whole point of this country is\u00a0to have a chance, isn\u2019t it?)\n\nMaking it to 250 and beyond will take work and a high degree of awareness and seriousness, but it\u2019s work that can build into something worthwhile and, along with what we didn\u2019t have before: the new self-reckoning that the new generation has, it\u2019s work that can build into something that\u2019s truly pride-while.\n\nBut the only way we can have that chance is \u00a0if the democracy can be preserved, and the only way that can happen is if Harris is elected president.\n\nThere really is no other way.

They just did it, and my colleagues and I had to take the brunt of everyone's anger while trying to pretend like we knew what was going on.

American politics are global politics and if somehow Trump wins this, it'll be a bad time for you and for the rest of the world. \n\nOver here in Europe, Trump will obviously hand Ukraine to Putin on a silver platter. Essentially, Ukraine will be history by the end of January if Trump gets back into the White House. Considering that he has also signalled that he will order the US military from not fulfilling your NATO obligations anymore, this will also spell doom for our Eastern European allies who Putin considers in his sphere of influence, such as the Baltic countries, Poland, Montenegro and others. \n\nIn the Eastern Mediterranean Trump will hand Netanyahu free rein to fully implement his final solution for Palestine and over in Asia-Pacific, Taiwan will get a rough deal where the United States' ongoing protection from Xi will be contingent on how many chips they deliver to the US. That will lead to an enormous strain on international technological development. \n\nEconomically, he has already said that he will start a trade war with all of us at once, which, yes, will hurt us, but will probably hurt you more. Especially when you combine that with the enormous economical downturn precipitated from rounding up and extraditing millions of migrant workers in the US. Combined, this will likely lead to a sustained, global recession. \n\nEcologically, a Trump win will set climate change back by years and will lead to irreversible damage to whatever is left of our fragile ecosystem. Humanity's continued ability to survive the climate catastrophe hinges on your decision tomorrow. \n\nHe has also signalled that he will instate vaccine-denying crackpots into senior roles at HHS, which could lead to an absolute catastrophe for all of us when the next pandemic rolls around. It's only a matter of time until that happens and we can't have someone like RFK jr at the helm when it does.\n\nHonestly, the world needs you not to fuck this up tomorrow. Please, make us proud.",

Talked about how he dealt with white racists and black racists, would get in brawls with self-ascribed nazis and people that would use the n-word since high school. Lo and behold, Obama is president and running for reelection and he starts calling him \u201cblack\u201d like it\u2019s an insult, then cuts himself off from saying the n-word in front me. Told him I knew what he was saying and was disappointed, that\u2019s not the Republican values he taught.\n\nHe thought Trump was the coolest and should be president back in 2011 before he passed away.\n\nI don\u2019t know who these whackos are with \u201cR\u201d next to their name, the true Republicans I guess.

There isn't much accountability at the higher levels, and we give a disproportionate amount of power to land mass because the founders were concerned about the majority trampling the minority at all times.\n\nThe Trump era has exposed the leaks in our media literacy, competency, and accuracy, as well.  There are some natural consequences of capitalism at play in that, but there's also the shift in the Overton Window and not much recognition of it from key players.  Everyone has been treating the republican party like the same old republican party and standards have never been lower.\n\nFor the Boomers among us, that's decades of propaganda at work, among other things like cognitive decline.  For some of the youth, they never have had the chance to get educated and learn any better.  They were manipulated while still particularly naive through YouTube and other social media platforms.\n\nOur entire system needs a fairly hard reset, but there's not many ways to achieve that outside of the most difficult means.",

Trump who'll set the dogs on you for daring to protest for gazans rights; but the plight of gazans will be the least of ones worries when in jail after being pepper sprayed.

Let's not even get into what would be better or worse for Palestinians with a Harris win, but voting for her does not mean you approve her continuing to engage in a 70+ year war that literally ever administration has been a part of and will be a part of regardless of who wins tomorrow.\n\nThis false narrative also implies you can't pressure/protest presidents you vote for when they do things you don't like. Speaking of, a common complaint of leftists when explaining what they won't vote is that they think it's implied that if you vote, that's the extent of your political engagement. However, how many of these leftists are activists and how many of them are keyboard warriors? I do know plenty who fall into both categories so I at least give credit to those who are activists working in grass roots causes.\n\nLastly, when you vote, you need to factor in what will change and what won't. If engaging in genocide (regardless of scale of engagement) is going to occur regardless of who wins the presidency, then it ceases to become a factor when voting. \n\nSo, miss me with that \"I won't vote for genocide\" bullshit. Also, I mean really, since statistically speaking lack of votes supports Republicans, and the current Republican promises to do worse to Palestinians, you actually *are* voting for genocide by choosing not to vote.",

Also recognize, leftists represent a variety of demographics. Personally, I know more of the queer community to lean left further than not, and considering we\u2019re all scared of a second Trump term, we\u2019re voting for the option that doesn\u2019t rebrand a portion of us as pedophiles who deserve to be executed.\n\nNow, if you think we are a significant enough number of voters that we\u2019d throw an entire election, why aren\u2019t you more pissed at Kamala for not throwing single issue pro-Palestine leftists a bone? All she needs to do is play lip service with leftists at the least to get a vote, so why can\u2019t she even bother doing that if she wants to defeat Trump? It would be like if she was for keeping abortion up to the states, and every left-wing woman in the US gets outraged that she\u2019s not doing enough to earn their vote on the one thing. People would think she\u2019s a dumb ass for not pursuing that demographic, but then imagine you have a bunch of hardline democrats telling you \u201cyou\u2019re a fucking idiot if you\u2019re not voting for Kamala because your alternative is worse\u201d\n\nI think that these leftists you\u2019re complaining about are an insignificant part of the voting population that you\u2019ve chosen to over generalize to a point where I personally start finding it borderline offensive toward the majority of us that are probably just grumbling while we vote for someone who does not represent our class interests.\n\nAnd when you choose to make leftists your boogeyman for losing the election, you fall into the hands of the people in power who have money by choosing to infight with a segment of the population who has more in common ideologically than right-wingers do instead of focusing on the people in power wronging us all. \n\nThese \u201cawwww fuck leftists\u201d posts are so fucking dumb and substanceless when we have an actual enemy to stand against.",

There are still 2.2 million people in Gaza today... should we forget that aid is currently being withheld from the area, which includes food, water, medical equipment, and fuel?  Should we forget that millions were told to shelter on the beach with no where to take a shit except for in the sand... and as the rainy season comes... what happens to that shit when the ground is covered in water.\n\nWomen's rights are important... 100% ... but an ethnic cleansing leading to potentially hundreds of thousands dead, hundreds of thousands injured, potentially a million starved, and ultimately potentially millions forced off their land...AGAIN!... is also pretty GD important.\n\nIt's funny you insist that this is a single issue...  usually the statement is \"they think it's more important than abortion rights\".   Seems to me, a lot of people voting Democrat are also single issue voters... women's reproductive rights being the issue.\n\nWhat I don't understand is what you think Harris will do about it?  Roe is gone, and the Supreme Court isn't going anywhere for the next 4 years, unless one suddenly dies, which even then, won't give the liberal justices a majority.  6 justices voted down Roe.  3 voted in defense of it.  This is now a state's issue, and I can't see how Trump would codify an abortion ban at the federal level without winning the presidency and having a majority in both houses of congress.  Something most analysts don't think is coming.  So am I willing to pause on this issue and triage the ongoing atrocity occurring in Gaza?  Yes I am.\n\nBut ... have you ever considered that the Israel protest isn't just a single issue?  I don't think it's as simple as you're letting on.  If you care to read why I think that, then here you go.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1gjknnt/comment/lvg6cn5/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web3x&utm\\_name=web3xcss&utm\\_term=1&utm\\_content=share\\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1gjknnt/comment/lvg6cn5/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\nOf course, I honestly don't think you or anyone else will read it.  People don't want the facts.  They don't want to think about complex issues... they want simple and easy black and white decisions.  To me, that's the embodiment of ignorance.\n\nNot that I want it to happen, or that I think it'll happen, but I could also tell you that strategically over the longer term, it makes more sense for Donald Trump to win this election and preside over the next 4 years as the economy weakens.  It's his last term; I very highly doubt he'll circumvent our Democracy.  Even if he were able to, the man's simply not gonna last much longer...  More likely is we have another election in 4 years... except if Trump does a horrible job as we all think he will, then it will give Democrats a real possible run at winning the presidency and both houses of congress in 2028.  Now if you want to codify abortion rights at the federal level.. then that is the only possible way to do it.\n\nY'all like to say things like , \"But Trump would level Gaza and be worse than Democrats\".   When people say this, I know they haven't actually been following what's been happening in Gaza or spent a moment to look at how much damage has already been done.  Gaza has already been leveled.  The US has already supplied Israel with $18 billion in weaponry this year to finish leveling it.  We've put zero conditions on our aid to them.  If they run out of weapons, we'll just do another aid package.\n\nHowever, if the US allows this conflict to continue unabated... to allow Israel to continue to escalate this conflict in the middle east, then we could quickly find ourselves in a large scale war with Lebanon, Syria, and Iran simultaneously.  Another conflict that could resolve in hundreds of thousands of people killed.\n\n\"But women's reproductive rights\"... am'i'right?\n\nThis is the problem with thinking so short term.  This is the issue with the real 'single issue voters'.  You never think beyond the current moment.  You never think about the entire picture.\n\nIt really does beg the question... why are Democrats not moving on this issue when it's clear that a fairly hefty chunk of typical Democratic voters are saying they won't vote for Democrats, and may never vote for them again?  That in of itself is an additional issue to consider.  What is the force acting on the Democrats to enable them to support a genocide and to enable them to stop listening to the voters?\n\nYou \"think\" it's just about Gaza.  You don't realize it's about the Democrat party as a whole, and in fact the entire US governmental system.",
         "This is the craziness of this whole thing. Trump wanting to skip past Netanyahu and nuke Gaza isn't a thing with zero percent probability. In fact I think he may very well need to be talked down from doing it.\n\nYet we have people saying voting for Harris is the same thing. FFS.",

I think it's also worth pointing out that this article is from July and one of the quotes in the article:\n\n\"Nabeel said Palestinians in Gaza just want the next US president to speak about \u201csafety, freedom and healing\u201d rather than Israel\u2019s right to \u201cself-defence\u201d.\"\n\nAfter Harris became the Democratic nominee, she has consistently brought up Israels right to self-defence since this article came out. The sad reality is most Palestinians believe what is happening is just going to continue regardless of who becomes president. The article does not provide ample evidence that Palestinians think Trump will be significantly worse.

         "Preach on.\n\nFact is, there are a lot of single issue voters in here.  The primary issue I hear in response to those protesting against voting for an administration that's actively, as in right now, supporting a genocide, is women's reproductive rights.\n\nWell, hate to break this to everyone, but Roe's gone and it ain't coming back.  It's now up to the states to decide on abortion, which has little to do with the president, and is often voted on by the people of the state as ballot proposals.  In those cases where the state congress and governor has decided to push foward with their own legislation, the people can still override that with proposals or vote out their legislature.\n\nIt's pretty interesting that Biden insisted that if he wins the next election he'll codify Roe.  I assume Harris is making the same claim.  The question is how.  If they don't win the presidency and both houses of congress, then it ain't happening.  Worse, if they win, and the country goes into a financial recession, then that typically results in the party in charge at the time losing the next election cycle in a huge way.  Meaning, Democrats can not only NOT move forward with codifying abortion rights, but they'll lose the next election in a big way, which could possibly make the situation even worse.\n\nAnd as you said, unless the Democrats are intentionally trying to lose or believe the protest vote isn't big enough to deter their win, then those people refusing to vote for a pro-genocide Democratic candidate aren't an issue anyways.  If Harris loses, it'll be because she either intended to lose, and intended to alienate those protestors,  or she made a major miscalculation in choosing to hold strong on this administration's and the Democratic Party's pro-genocidal stance.\n\nFrankly, having spent a lot of time following this ethnic cleansing, and reviewing the history of this conflict... and after having been insulted by the leftists by being called an anti-Semite for protesting against Israel's actions... there's one thing that still drives me quite nuts; when the left claims they'll continue pushing forward with a two-state solution.  Do we all realize that claims of pursuing a two-state solution go all the way back to 1947?  They've been at it for 77 years now... it's not gonna happen.\n\nFor anyone paying attention, Israel has done two things fairly recently:\n\n1. They've dotted the West Bank with ILLEGAL Israel settlements, making that land essentially impossible to host a Palestinian state.  The Israel government has been assisting them in this both financially and militarily.  The US has done nothing to stop it.  In fact, many of the settlers are Americans.  Even if Palestinians were given a state, are we claiming that the settlement growth will just stop, and won't continue proceeding illegally?\n2. They've essentially destroyed Gaza.  Completely flattened it.  Which is ironic to hear people claim \"but Donald Trump has promised to flatten Gaza\".  Uh... HELLLOOO everyone, have you not seen the photos?  Have you not seen the videos?  Gaza IS flattened.  Over 2% of the entire population has been killed.  Over 4% injured/maimed.\n\nOf course most of y'all haven't been paying attention... you can't be bothered to actually take the time and look at what's happening there.  You can't be bothered to understand why so many people are SO disturbed by what OUR government has enabled that we can't, in good conscience, vote for them this election, and possibly never again....\n\nHave we never considered that maybe this 'single issue' is a big deal?",

That toll in just one year of conflict, and that's just the informal count of the dead.  There are said to potentially be tens of thousands still buried in the rubble.  I won't bother getting into the count of the injured, the percentage of the city that was destroyed (including people losing just about everything they had in the world), or the forced famine due to lack of aid.\n\nI also won't get into the fact that this is now escalating into Lebanon, Syria, and Iran.\n\nBut real quick... you be the judge.  What happens if this conflict escalates to all surrounding nations and the US gets dragged into the war?  How many American soldiers are we willing to lose?  How many innocent civilians are we willing to bomb?\n\nYou suggest that our \"virtue signaling\"... 'our' which includes US women... is worth more than your life and your rights.  Well, to be blunt... I know you as much as I know all those people who died in Gaza.. which is to say, I don't know any of you.  So ... why should you be more important to me than they are?\n\nI'll just point out that many, even potentially most people supporting Gaza also defend women's rights to choose.  I mean, afterall, these are the same left leaning voters that would have voted Harris if not for this issue of the Democratic party and the Democratic presidential administration actively supporting an ongoing genocide...\n\nIt's weird you place all the blame on these particular voters though.  Are you suggesting that the Democratic party couldn't have supported both US women AND Palestinian civilians?  That they couldn't have at least offered a bone?  That they couldn't have constrained themselves from calling these voters, those who called out Israel's abhorrent actions or defended Palestinians, anti-Semites.  That includes Jews btw... which I don't know if you're Jewish.. .but that's quite an insult to call Jews anti-Semites...aka Jew haters.\n\nThose politicians are completely aware of why this group is opting not to vote for them.  They know full well, but they still refuse to change their stance.  Why is that?  Why don't you cast any blame at them?\n\nI guess my question is... why are you putting women's bodily rights above the rights of nearly 2.2 million people who are currently living in a severe situation?  Why don't you find the second issue as important as the first... choosing to stand with those of us who find both issues important, and demanding the Democrat party change their policy or else risk losing your vote.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\n\nEdit: I'll just add.  We passed abortion rights in my state.  Why is it the people in my state's fault that your state restricted abortion rights?  Maybe the people of your state need to work on getting an amendment passed, or maybe a change in leadership?  \n\nAs much as I think a lot of people believe Harris will magically fix abortion rights, or codify them at the federal level... no one thinks Democrats will get a majority in both of houses of congress, needed to legalize abortion at the federal level.  Therefore, I fail to see what Harris could do that Biden couldn't have already done.  I also fail to see what Trump could do.  He equally doesn't have access to ban abortion at the federal level since he doesn't have the necessary congressional votes.  \n\nIt would take two conservative Supreme Court Justices retiring or dying in the next 4 years to enable Harris to replace both with liberal justices who will re-enable Roe.  Chances of that happening are extremely slim.  In fact, it's more likely to happen 4-8 years from now than it is to happen over the next 4.  Therefore, it's far more critical for Democrats to get a victory in 2028 than it is to get an issue in 2024 on that particular issue.\n\nSee what happens when we start considering the full picture?",

         "\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nOh, and btw... it's not exactly a single issue.  There are quite a few issues rolled into this.  You can include out of control military spending.\n\n[U.S. Military Spending/Defense Budget 1960-2024](https://www.macrotrends.net/global-metrics/countries/USA/united-states/military-spending-defense-budget)  (Highest on record)\n\nYou can include the Israel lobby that seems to be directing the US' Israel policy using funding from the unknowing US taxpayer, laundered through Israel in our multi-billion dollar aid packages.  Did any of y'all know the US taxpayer has funded Israel to the tune of about $350 billion... that we know of?  That doesn't even include direct US military intervention on Israel's behalf in the region.  It doesn't include purchases of Israeli military technology and spying insights... no doubt at a pretty hefty upcharge.\n\nYou can include Iraq.  Is everyone in here unaware that Israel was heavily lobbying the US to attack Iraq in 2002, just prior to the US invasion?  That war is said to have cost the US between $1 trillion and $3 trillion, lead to the death of thousands of US soldiers, and hundreds of thousands of innocent Iraqis.  I'm sure if I looked into it a little further, it'd become evident that Israel had some major financial benefits come from that war.\n\nHave we noticed what Israel was doing right now?  They're escalating conflicts with Lebanon and Iran, and have been for some time now lobbying the US to attack Iran.  Would anyone here like the US to get involved in another multi-trillion dollar multi-year war that leaves hundreds of thousands of more civilians dead?\n\nAnd these are just the issues with this administration that relate to Israel.  What about US policies like hiring shit tons of government workers to prop up the economy?  Government workers, generally, aren't very productive in the long term, save for education.   Where I think many of those jobs are coming from are military and weapons production.  Ironically, we have to supply the weapons to Israel, which is paid for by US taxpayers... so taxpayers are massively funding the US military industrial complex.  Again, no doubt at a nice premium for those companies.\n\nDemocrats have lead us much deeper into debt.  Outside of the pandemic, we're currently sitting at the highest deficit number on record... during what's claimed to be a hot economy, and that's after counting inflation.  Typically in hot economies, the deficit is near its record lows.  That absolutely is not the case today.  Sure, Republicans are often just as bad, if not worse... but that doesn't absolve Democrats.\n\nHow about Elon Musk? We all love Elon Musk around here, right?  Y'all do realize who passed the policies to subsidize and prop up Musk's companies and his wealth right?  The IRA was one of the largest handouts to a single auto company in the history of the automotive industry.  It doesn't take a genius to look at where the lion's share of the EV tax credit money went to.  It went to Tesla just as they started to see their demand drop off a cliff in the US and their car inventories start to build.  Musk's company was in trouble, so the Democrats bailed him out.\n\nHow about SpaceX?  It seems like SpaceX has become a bottomless pit in terms of government funding.  It also seems the government has been more than willing to allow him to launch as many Starlink satellites as he wants, which not only gives SpaceX a huge competitive advantage in global internet service, but also potentially creates a massive anti-Trust issue if this leads to other providers folding, or trying to launch their own satellite constellation.  Who's going to launch their satellites for them?  Their direct competitor??\n\nWe're all pissed about Elon Musk using his immense wealth to influence politics... but it was the Democrats that built his power and his wealth... and even after the man has attacked Democrats, they still continued to support him and his companies with the IRA and new massive grants to SpaceX.  The Democratic party helped create the devil by picking a corporate winner and telling investors \"we won't let this company fail, so you're free to invest and hyperinflate the stock, and make its CEO and largest shareholder the richest man on the planet\".  Must turned around and used his new found wealth to support Republicans.\n\nSo no... this isn't just a single issue.\n\nThe problem with you tribalist Democrats is you presumed it was only one issue and attacked people for having that single issue.

It sounds like the person I responded to is in a far off state, so again, why do they get priority in who I or the protest voters care about?  In my state, a state where the protest vote is among the loudest in the nation, we legalized abortion.  It's interesting that the person I responded to isn't more concerned about voters in her state getting the legislation passed there or pushing a change in their governorship.  It's weird that rather than blaming her governorship... she's blaming people demanding a change to a policy that's resulting in one of the worst atrocities in the history of the world.\n\nInteresting enough, many of the protest votes are Arabs and Jews... who have family in those regions who are absolutely being affected.  Many have lost family members to this massacre.  Jews without families there, OTOH, are still being impacted by Israel's and the Democratic establishment's constant equivocation of Israelis / Zionists to the Jewish ethnicity, even as those Jews protest against the atrocities.  All of the above are labeled as anti-Semites for defending innocent people and calling out Israel's actions.\n\nSo yes, it actually does matter a lot to a lot of people.\n\nThe problem with your argument is also that it's not simply a conflict; it quickly devolved into an ethnic cleansing / genocide.

         "Yeah no worries dawg I didn\u2019t feel like you were accusing me of anything. I actually appreciate you pointing it out to me. It was a nice reminder to not be reactionary",
         "Why didn\u2019t he do what? Hand over Ukraine?  His position on the two state solution is abundantly clear. I am sure you are aware he doesn\u2019t see two states, just one Israel. During his term I don\u2019t recall Hamas attacking Israel, is this somehow something you credit him for?",
         "So... no blame for Netanyahu here?\n\nThe guy that repeatedly violates the ceasefires, upends any chance at diplomacy by adding on absurd conditions to any agreement at the last second, and even had Nasrallah assassinated shortly after they had reached a ceasefire agreement before invading Lebanon two days later?\n\nBibi doesn't want the war to end. He knows once it's over, he's finished.",
         "cant really negotiate with Israel when their slogan is the entire middle east will soon be israel",
         "Hamas and their terrorist attack are the reason Netanyahu hasn't been removed. Hamas fucked the Palestinians and helped Israel's far right. They knew this would happen.\n\nYet somehow, it's all Biden's fault.",
         "If you believe that there is no good option, you go with the least bad option.",
         ">Is that really the only thing that matters to you?\n\nThings that matter to me:\n\n* Maintaining a livable climate on Earth for at least my lifetime but hopefully longer\n* Preserving what is left of American democracy, and restoring the rest\n* Protecting the rights and freedoms of my fellow Americans, including but not limited to women, LGTBQ people, racial minorities, atheists, and sexual minorities.\n* Working towards universal healthcare coverage, so that being healthy is a right and not a privilege.\n* Creating more affordable housing so that the middle class American dream is within reach of more people.\n* Legalizing cannabis and ending the racist war on drugs.\n* Having a stable and functional economy and a tax system that supports the middle class instead of further empowering only the richest oligarchs.\n* Having a steady leader who isn't a crazy deplorable fascist piece of garbage who can work towards global geopolitical stability and, dare to dream, maybe even some form of peaceful coexistence.\n\nAs such, the decision to vote for Harris and reject Trump was the most obvious and easy choice of my life so far.\n\nHypothetically speaking, even IF one was a single-issue voter on Israel/Palestine (which, if so... uh, why..?) Harris is still the better option than Trump because it's no secret that Trump doesn't care for arab muslims here in America and he was already confirmed that he would give Netanyahu carte blanche to do whatever the fuck he wants in Gaza, Lebanon and the West Bank.\n\nBy all means, if you want to see what unmitigated genocide and conquest looks like, vote for someone other than Harris, because Trump will assure we get Netanyahu unleashed.",
         "Who am I being a jerk to?",
         "It's amusing that you give no credit for things that actually happened during his presidency but you're making him responsible for things you'll imagine he'll do if he gets re- elected.\u00a0 Very logical.\u00a0\u00a0",
         "I think bibi deserves to be removed from power and locked up in the hag for war crimes",
         "Hamas continuing the hold hostages is likely the significant reason why Netanyahu has been able to get away with a lot more shit than he should, and it does not seem like holding the hostages is doing anything positive for anyone.",
         "[deleted]",
         "no - israeli extremism and racism is the reason netanyahu hasnt been removed.",
         "Did he ever explicitly say he was making an argument not to vote or are we just making assumptions here?",
         "I'm not arguing against that. You're missing context because one of the above comments was deleted. But yes, Harris is superior to Trump, I agree",
         "You mean things that didn\u2019t happen?  What \u201c did happen\u201d ? He has spoken clearly about both Ukraine and the fact he has no interest in a two stste solution. So I am \u201c amused\u201d by your \u201c un logic\u201d .",
         "No one is saying that Israel doesnt commit war crimes and that they have been good in their relationship with Palestine, but this current war was the result of a massive invasion/terrorist act. Like OP said, every single person would have told you this would be the reaction to a massive attack like Oct. 7th and yet Hamas still did it, and took hundreds of hostages to boot to force Israel's hand. Hamas is a death cult.",
         "I didn't make any assumptions.",
         "Ok I see. It looks like a direct response to me, sorry!",
         "this current war is the result of 75 years of ethnic cleansing and apartheid on the part of israel - october 7th was a symptom of israeli colonization.",
         "Wow, you managed to take one of the most complex geopolitical problems in the world and summarized it to one sentence that has one party without agency and the other is evil. Such a nuanced and intelligent viewpoint. Jill Stein awaits your vote lol"

         "The Character and Eligibility of Donald Trump: A Critical Examination.\n\nThis paper examines Donald Trump\u2019s character and constitutional eligibility to serve as president, focusing on the disqualification clause in the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. A central argument is that his impeachment by Congress unequivocally establishes his ineligibility, as he engaged in insurrection on January 6th, 2021. He conspired with others to have Vice President Pence reject state-certified electors and incited his supporters into rebellion. Under the Constitution, such actions disqualify him from holding public office, mirroring historical precedents where Congress or governors have refused to certify the elections of individuals deemed by them to be insurrectionists. America\u2019s most esteemed presidents, like George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, are celebrated not only for their leadership but for their unwavering integrity and commitment to democratic principles. Washington\u2019s humility and dedication set the foundational values of the nation, while Lincoln\u2019s moral conviction preserved its unity during its most perilous times. In stark contrast, Trump\u2019s conduct\u2014both during his tenure and specifically on January 6th\u2014reveals a profound deficiency in character. His reckless and divisive actions pose a direct threat to the very fabric of democracy. This paper argues that, based on constitutional mandates and the essential qualities required of a president, Trump\u2019s character and actions categorically disqualify him from the presidency, irrespective of policy positions or partisan affiliations.\n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/384473246_The_Character_and_Eligibility_of_Donald_Trump_A_Critical_Examination/stats",

But I can answer the specific, mathematical question you have.\n\nYou're implicitly assuming the same people are voting, that the demographics stay the same size and/or that the chance someone votes is not related to the candidate they vote for.\n\nFor example, if democrats are equally likely to vote, but republicans become much more likely to vote, then republicans could win even if there are fewer republicans in every demographic you look at.\n\nAnother example, let's say 60 percent of elderly people are likely to voting republican, and there are a million of these. And 39 percent of young people vote republican, and there are a million of these. Now democrats win with 100000 votes.\n\nBut 4 years later, 59 percent of elderly people vote republican, but there are now 1.2 million of them. There are now 0.8 million young people, and 38% vote republican. So both demographics have improved for democrats, but now the republicans win.\n\nLike I said, this is just the mathematical answer to your questions, I'm not looking at realistic numbers. I mentioned this because I saw a video from a republican making point with a similar mistake (doing a calculation where they assume exactly the same people vote) and it annoyed me, \"we\" should do better.",

         "There are a few polls showing him gaining ground with black and Hispanic voters. Polling of Hispanic voters has been all over the place - hard to tell. And we need to remember that Hispanic voters are not a monolith. Cubans view this election very differently than Mexicans, who viewed this very differently from Puerto Ricans. We know that Trump made some serious gains in South Florida and South Texas, let\u2019s see if he holds those together. And if he can find a way to continue eating into Democrats typical margin among Hispanic voters.\n\nI am skeptical if Trump has genuinely made gains with black men - which is the narrative - but we will get some ideas fairly early on Tuesday. Once again, polling has been all over the place on this issue.\n\nFlorida returns will show us a lot. I don\u2019t anticipate Harris winning Florida, but Florida has some heavily Hispanic areas and some heavily black areas which could indicate if Trump gains with those two constituencies are real.\n\nTo me, this election comes down to two things. First, Harris has made a full court press for white women in the suburbs. I will be looking to see if she outperform Biden in suburbs around major cities. Second, Trump has made a hard play for young men, especially minorities. I would be looking to see if Trump eats into Biden\u2018s 2020 margins with black voters, or expands the progress he made Hispanic voters in 16 and 20.\n\nAnother place to watch early is Virginia. Harris will win Virginia. But I am specifically looking at the northern Virginia suburbs and the heavily black counties in Southeast Virginia to determine if either of those two trends is real. In northern Virginia, keep an eye on Loudon, Fairfax, and Falls Church city. In southeast Virginia, keep an eye on Hampton, Norfolk, and Portsmouth. If Harris loses ground among black voters in Virginia, but does not make additional gains in the affluent northern Virginia suburbs, that could spell trouble for other states with similar demographics, such as Pennsylvania. Alternatively, if we see that Harris has held the margins that Biden had in these two areas, it likely shows that she has held together the Biden coalition.\n\nTrump will overwhelmingly win white men. Harris will overwhelmingly win minority women. The two groups that will decide this election are white women and minority men. Specifically, women in the suburbs of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh and men in the cities of Philadelphia, Detroit, and Milwaukee.",

I live in a relatively rural area in a swing state, and in 2016 there were Trump signs fucking everywhere. Now just a couple of the houses near me have a single Trump sign each, and I'm seeing more Harris / Walz signs than I would have dared hope. I also have a couple of conservative family members who won't publicly admit it, but have privately told me that they're actually voting for Harris this time around.\n\nIt's very difficult for me to believe that the massively increased excitement for the Democratic ticket and the massively reduced excitement for the Republican ticket still leaves us in a dead heat. Can't wait to see the real numbers tomorrow.",

There's an episode where he finds out his wife modeled for a painting once, but the painter took the liberty of painting her in the nude. \n\nHis reactions when he goes to the art gallery to see the painting leave me in stitches every time. [Here's](https://youtu.be/WXxyCJbmCng?t=894) that episode, linked to start at the scene I'm talking about.",

He hasn't been on tv since what, 1974?  I do love him. I support Kamala, but can't support the headline that this is a big Hollywood endorsement.",

He also had a memorable, viral run on *The Masked Singer* just last year.\n\nPlus, new generations of children are watching *Mary Poppins* and *Chitty Chitty Bang Bang*. Comedy lovers from every generation continue to discover *The Dick Van Dyke Show*\n\nPeople know who he is.",
         "OK I accept that and stand corrected,  But this is still, to me, not BIG.   I guarantee you I could go to work tomorrow and ask and half my coworkers wouldn't know him. \n\nBut I don't know how BIG any celebrity endorsement really is.  If people are motivated to vote, maybe, but an apathetic say, Taylor Swift fan, is probably not going to change their voting habits if they're not someone who follows or thinks about politics,"
