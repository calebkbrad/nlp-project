North Carolina is not a real swing state and hasn\u2019t been since Obama won in 2008 (he also won Indiana but Democrats decided to ignore that part apparently). Wisconsin likely to Harris but barely. Arizona and Georgia back to GOP. It\u2019ll be 287-312 electoral votes for Trump. And that sucks but it\u2019s what happens when Democrats go with the worst candidates possible time and time again.",

He did say not to underestimate Trump\u2019s support in the run up to the election."

         "Color me shocked.",
         "Article Text:\n\nFormer President Donald Trump closed his Madison Square Garden rally on Sunday with an ominous 80-minute speech denouncing his political rivals, assailing immigrants and promising to invoke an 18th century law to pave the way for mass deportations.\n\nBut it was the opening acts of the New York City rally \u2013 a hodgepodge of donors, entertainers and MAGA politicians \u2013 who unleashed an eleventh-hour campaign furor that prompted angry rebukes from Democrats and some Republicans who worried the vengeful show would hurt their standing with moderate voters.\n\nLocal Trump loyalists, who made up many of the speakers\u2019 list ahead of the former president, took the opportunity to spew familiar grievances at some of Trump\u2019s favorite targets. One failed Republican House candidate labeled Harris \u201cthe antichrist.\u201d\n\nHe hardly stood out.\n\nThe rally began with Tony Hinchcliffe, a comedian and podcast host, assailing Puerto Rico \u2013 in the city that\u2019s home to the largest Puerto Rican population on the US mainland. About 500,000 Puerto Ricans also live in battleground Pennsylvania, where Harris campaigned on Sunday.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot going on, like, I don\u2019t know if you know this but there\u2019s literally a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean right now,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s called Puerto Rico.\u201d\n\nThe line was well-received by Trump supporters who filled the historic arena in Midtown Manhattan. Trump has recently taken to calling the US \u201ca garbage can for the world\u201d when he rails against undocumented immigrants.\n\n\u201cThese Latinos, they love making babies, too. Just know that they do,\u201d Hinchcliffe continued.\n\nAfter the rally, Trump\u2019s campaign sought to distance itself from Hinchcliffe, who like the other speakers was an invited guest, and his comments about Puerto Rico.\n\n\u201cThis joke does not reflect the views of President Trump or the campaign,\u201d Trump campaign spokesperson Danielle Alvarez said in a statement to CNN.\n\nBut Harris\u2019 campaign had already seized on the attacks on Puerto Rico, quickly clipping the video and posting it on social media channels. The vice president on Sunday visited a Puerto Rican restaurant in North Philadelphia, where she discussed her vision for the island along with plans to lower costs and create opportunity in Puerto Rican communities on the mainland.\n\nPuerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny, whose album \u201cUn Verano Sin Ti\u201d was the most-streamed album globally in 2023, posted a video of Harris spelling out her plan for Puerto Rico to his 45 million Instagram followers shortly after Hinchcliffe left the stage.\n\nRepublican Sen. Rick Scott of Florida, whose reelection campaign depends on sizable support from the state\u2019s Puerto Rican community, joined the backlash, writing of the \u201cjoke\u201d on X, \u201cIt\u2019s not funny and it\u2019s not true. Puerto Ricans are amazing people and amazing Americans!\u201d\n\nHinchcliffe, also on social media, addressed the furor, saying that his critics \u201chave no sense of humor.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love Puerto Rico and vacation there. I made fun of everyone \u2026 watch the whole set,\u201d he wrote.\n\nTrump \u2014 who was introduced by former first lady Melania Trump in her first speaking role at a rally this cycle \u2014 largely stuck to the script in his own remarks, including his now common assertion that his political rivals represent a traitorous \u201cenemy within.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re running against a massive, crooked, malicious leftist machine that\u2019s running the Democrat party,\u201d the former president said. \u201cThey are smart and vicious, they are the enemy within, we must defeat them.\u201d\n\nAnother warm-up act, former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, reprised his old attacks on Harris and the idea, as he described it, of Americans celebrating her possible election.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gonna be pretty hard to look at (the country after Harris wins) and say, you know what, Kamala Harris, she got 85 million votes because she\u2019s so impressive \u2013 as the first Samoan, Malaysian, low IQ former California prosecutor ever to be elected president,\u201d said Carlson, before exclaiming that anyone who is not impressed by Harris will be called a \u201cfreak\u201d or a \u201ccriminal.\u201d\n\nLater, Republican politician David Rem took the microphone to call Harris \u201cthe devil\u201d while waving around a cross.\n\n\u201cShe is the antichrist,\u201d Rem wailed, before saying he planned to run for mayor.\n\nAnother speaker, radio host Sid Rosenberg \u2014 who once occupied a plum seat beside Don Imus on WFAN, the area\u2019s largest sports station \u2014 started off by attacking Clinton, the Democratic nominee from eight years ago.\n\n\u201cShe is some sick bastard, that Hillary Clinton, huh?,\u201d he said, channeling Trump\u2019s own past remarks. \u201cWhat a sick son of a b*tch.\u201d\n\nRosenberg then turned his attention to migrants now living in New York City \u2013 and his fury over the local government\u2019s attempts to feed and house them.\n\n\u201cYou got homeless and veterans \u2013 Americans, Americans \u2013 sleeping on their own feces on a bench in Central Park,\u201d Rosenberg said. \u201cBut the f**king illegals, they get whatever they want, don\u2019t they?\u201d"

         "Agreed. My late father was a gun nut. He owned 37 of them when he died. He smuggled two loaded derringers into the hospital on one of his many trips there in his final days. My mother found them before he shot himself or someone at the hospital. When he died we had three illegal weapons to get rid of, two sawed off shotguns and an AK 47 style rifle that he had converted to an automatic weapon with a kit from a gun show. He didn\u2019t shoot it that much it was just too expensive to go through so many bullets so fast. I shot it once. My father also collected salt and pepper shakers. He had hundreds of them. They were all cheap things he picked up at garage sales and thrift stores. There was some sort of obsessive compulsive thing going on with him.\n\nI think the key to gun control in America is to forget about the guns and make it hard to get bullets. Sure some people will make their own but most won\u2019t. Make the ingredients to make them controlled substances. Make them expensive.

Ultimately, the young woman needed a tracheostomy and a feeding tube. \n\nBy the time insurance said yes, more than 1 year from her initial visit, the future the team had envisioned seemed out of reach. \n\n''Unfortunately for this patient, it went from a potentially curable situation to a likely not curable situation,\u201d recalled Giap, a clinician at Massachusetts General Hospital and instructor at Harvard Medical School. \u201cI wanted to cry every day that she waited.'' \n\nWhile a stark example, such insurance delays are not uncommon, according to new research published in JAMA Network Open.\n\nThe study of 206 denials in radiation oncology concluded that more than two-thirds were ultimately approved on appeal without changes, but often these approvals came only after costly delays that potentially compromised patient care.\n\nOther studies have found that number to be even higher, with more than 86% of prior authorization requests ultimately approved with few changes.",
         "Friend used to enter doctor referrals and codes into an insurance company's system. She had no medical training. She'd have to approve treatment. Sometimes the codes would kick back questions. If the code was a typo or didn't match diagnosis she was supposed to reject treatment and send back to doctor. If she could tell it was a typo she'd approve treatment and ask doctor's office to correct paperwork. The insurance company kept giving her more and more to enter. She couldn't keep up. She was told to get someone to help her. Essentially hire a freelancer. She couldn't find anyone reliable. Eventually she hired her 13 year old nephew. He was reliable and motivated, got paid piece meal so he worked every free minute. I wonder how many people had treatment rejected by a 13 year old.",

         "Of the seven swing states, five of them have Democratic secretaries of state. \n\n(NC, NV, AZ, WI, MI)\n\nAs for Pennsylvania and Georgia, their secretaries of state have already refused to cooperate with this exact thing 4 years ago.",
         "Ok, so Biden won\u2019t leave while they litigate it for 5 years like Trumps crimes and if he dies the VP will take over",
         "That will be very difficult is she wins by a landslide. The data is looking like that is posible.\n\nAlso us knowing their game takes a lot of the ability to do it.",
         "Make sure there\u2019s no chance Trump can claim he almost won. We need to work to make it a landslide victory. Volunteer and canvass people!",
         "The counter move: Biden resigns in December, and Harris is sworn in. Stall certification of Kamala's win if you want, but still she would be president.\u00a0",
         "Let them reveal themselves to be the fascists they so desperately wish to be.",
         "Dems should plan a giant january 6th march on the capital.   Peacefully of course, they will dwarf whatever crowd trump can encourage to attend.\nTake back January 6th.  4 years ago Republicans used it to subvert democracy, this time dems can use it to stand up for democraxy.",
         "He owns SCOTUS, which is all he needs. So, while many of the comments here make light of what may happen after the election, I hope that actual leaders are taking it seriously and making plans for how to respond.",
         "I\u2019m ready",
         "Dem SoS, mostly (?) Dem Govs, Dem POTUS. It won\u2019t go the way they think or hope it will. They can delay it but in the end they\u2019ll have to certify especially if the margins show clear wins in those states. Sow all the distrust they want, they\u2019ll look like fascist toadies and I think, overall, people are sick of it.",
         "I've been hearing a lot of chatter that the problem is a ton of MAGA peeps that have been put in at county level elections offices. The idea supposedly is that counties themselves won't certify the real results that would then pass to state level officials.\n\nIt seems to decentralized to be effective enough ino though. Hopefully I'm not wrong",
         "Biden won by 7 million votes and they still tried to play games. The more states she wins, the more the magats will convince themselves it's fraud.",
         "Why would that be difficult if she wins by a landslide. What makes it more or less difficult is whose ahead in the senate. She could still win by 100 million votes and if Republicans control the Senate they can still block her. What's the plan B when that happens?",
         "They tried this in Wayne County, MI last time and it didn\u2019t work.",
         "Have you listen to the magas? Listen to their reasons supporting fraud?\n\nIn their heads the size of the crowds, how many political hats, flags, pin, and noise dictated voters. I know it's weird but listening to them proves their mind set on that. \n\nHarris is now blowing that mind set out of the water. Try and say these energetic people didn't vote and see the pushback.",
         "Unfortunately we still have the electoral college, which means Biden won by like 50,000 votes in a few states. It just takes a few states playing BS games to throw everything into chaos",
         "A louder out cry.\nRepublicans fear pushback and they would get one hell of a push back. Plan B is not for public view.",
         "But Orange Leader himself said his crowds are way bigger!  Therefore he wins!",
         "I'm just not sure about that at this point. If they say they'll pardon the Jan 6ers, I'm not sure there's anything they won't do."
