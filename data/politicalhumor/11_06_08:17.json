They have the Supreme Court and if they get the house and senate it will be project 2025.  This means the ACA is done.  The same maga republicans that voted to end it will just blame democrats and Obama when the suffer.",

I want to love my country but it feels like we\u2019ve hit a crossroads where our values no longer align. I won\u2019t take up arms against my country, but I don\u2019t have to stay here and I don\u2019t have to actively seek its success. I refuse to live in a country that is hell bent on going backwards to a past that didn\u2019t exist.

They deserve more since they participate in the real world\n\n(From a Canadian onlooker)",

         "I guess women who voted for Trump want their rights to be taken away? Do it, make their dreams happen.",
         "**One of the most surprising things about this election was that the Democrats somehow lost \\~10 million votes.** Biden got 81m votes in 2020. Harris so far, with my hand-made projections, looks to get no more than about 71m. WTF? Looks like Trump will actually win the popular vote this time, too, with about the same count as 2020. Double WTF.\n\nI'm not so much worried about Trump (who appears about as demented as Reagan was in his last couple of years) as I am about President Vance who will take charge when Trump is Article 25'd. Triple WTF.\n\nKeep in mind Biden has about 2 months to do things to minimize the damage a Trump administration will do. Let's hope he does something useful. (Sorry, I don't have specific suggestions in mind that I can write publicly.)\n\nSo you 10 million voters -- **why did you stay home this time?**\n\n(Note: post made as of 11:30PM CA time -- numbers might change in next 24 hours.)",
         "I'm from Germany and have gone to bed last night very optimistic, because of the record breaking voter turnout.\n\nI expected that this is a good sign for Harris/the Democrats.\n\nTurns out that there are millions of Americans that in 2020 and 2016 didn't vote for Trump, but are doing it now... because he is finally demented, insane and openly racist enough?\n\nOk, if that is what the Americans want.\n\nBut as an European I fear that this election will have even worse consequences for us than for the US. Trump will bow before Putin, cancel all support for Ukraine and pressure them to capitulate. This very much increases the probability of a direct war between Russia and all of Europe, because Putin will be assured by his victory in Ukraine and the weakness of the West/NATO to continue his wars of conquest. And Europe will be without its biggest ally in this war.\n\nI'm very concerned. The future looks bleak.",
         "I wanna have faith but then I think Of how much is at stake. This could ruin my life everything he has talked about taking away. It will ruin so many lives and cause so much suffering. And yet so many people can't see this.",

         "I think it's fair to surmise that the human experiment failed. It's one thing to make a mistake. But making the same mistake over and over again, voting against your own self-interest out of spite and hatred..\n\n\nOur habitat can't wait another 4 years - let alone for a Supreme Court of Republican shills to die off.\n\n\nThis was it, and it may be for the better. There's a German saying: \"Besser ein Ende mit Schrecken als ein Schrecken ohne Ende.\"\n\n\nBetter an end with dread than dread without end.",
         "I kept saying over and over that we are not figuring in society's ingrained misogyny.  Harris is clearly the better candidate, but too many people -- and too many of them women -- hate women to the point of derangement. \n\nYou'd think half of the population being systematically demoted to second class citizens would be a bigger news story.",

I haven\u2019t been this pissed off at this county in my life. I hope everyone\u2019s big fat grin after tonight slowly fades away day after day as the realization settles in that you FUCKED every last one of us and not just the people of today no no your children and your grandchildren get to grow up and ask why one of my family members would vote and allow such a monster of a human being to ever be in power.

Americans have given this angry, ignorant buffoon the power of not only the presidency, but the house and senate, to go with his personally chosen Supreme Court. He will pardon himself of his convictions and quash all the pending charges against him. All abortions under any circumstance will be federally outlawed, religion will be imposed in schools, and many rights afforded LGBT+ minorities eliminated. It's terrifying, and millions won't realize it until the kakistocracy slaps them in the face personally.  \n\nGood luck to you all. Keep your heads down.",

After Washington declined to run in 1976, that was supposed to happen, but it never did.\n\nThe equal representation by state in the senate was 100% a power grab by small state delegates, though later the balance of the senate had a lot to do with how new slave states and free states were admitted.

If you can't get 5% of the votes, you have 0 representation, even if a single seat in the parliament represents only 2% of voters for exmple. For this reason in the German state of Schleswig-Holstein there's an exception made for the party that represents the Danish minority.

People who objectively prefer them to Republicans on numerous policies are not voting for them. The Dems have to try to court new/different voters since they can\u2019t meet this standard of perfection that has been set.\n\nRepublicans will vote for a candidate that only partially meets their expectations as long as they have a general direction that those voters want, and they\u2019ll only stick with that person until someone more closely aligned shows up in the primaries, so the candidates either need to adopt those voter\u2019s positions or they get tossed aside for someone who has.

Also also also Biden isn\u2019t a fucking dictator and he was trying to work within a system that was trying to cripple him at every turn.\n\nNone of that should matter though because TRUMP IS INFINITELY WORSE. It was a binary choice. As we literally just fucking saw the choice was always between Harris or Trump and not voting was pretty much the same as voting for Trump. This is the guy who moved the embassy and wants Israel to \u201cfinish the job.\u201d This is who is going to be in office now. The choice was always a binary one. This isn\u2019t some goddamn fucking purity test. They interviewed actual Palestinians and all of them wanted Harris, because they knew that there had to be a choice and yeah sometimes you have to pick the lesser of two evils.\n\nAnd in terms of \u201cearning your vote\u201d I\u2019m sorry that \u201cactually believing in democracy\u201d wasn\u2019t enough for you.",
         "Cool. Don\u2019t care.\n\nBut I\u2019ll let every Jill stein voter know then. When they ban your rights, don\u2019t call me. Call Jill Stein. I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll help you.",
         "No because it's a war of attrition (and also Ukraines artillery is more accurate). Russia has been slowly winning and if Ukraine doesn't get more aid this will continue to happen.

         "It is an important word, yes. It doesn\u2019t excuse the deaths that have been or will be, but the land that the 90% can return to will no longer be theirs. As for the arming, yes there is aid, $3.8 billion a year since like WW2. Then you have the supplemental package of like $8 billion. There are restrictions to this aid to be used in defense only. A large portion of aid is going to anti missile defense systems to protect from the surrounding countries. Now whether or not Israel is using U.S. weapons offensively and against Palestinians, 50/50? Not sure how honest they\u2019d be about it. Israel has their own weapons manufacturers in country and they are some of the most sophisticated in the world. Not saying it\u2019s an excuse for providing aid, just the situation. Unfortunately nothing I have said matters, people have already cast or refrained from casting their votes. If Trump wins, Israel will annex Palestinian land and Trump hotels will be built on the coast. In this sense, the pro Palestinian protestors have voted for the demise of their country.",
         "That's a given. Look at some states that have been red for decades that have some of the poorest healthcare, economies, education, etc. Every cycle they vote for Republican mayors, senators, governors, etc. and things never get better in their state. But they keep voting because idk",
         "Trump has purposely been working to tank ceasefire talks\u2026 meanwhile the current admin is trying to get a ceasefire done, same as Kamala has stated she will work to do if elected\u2026 so yes actions are louder than words.",
         "You\u2019re not even bothering to pretend anymore.",
         "It doesn't matter who wins, Israel is going to attempt to annex Palestinian land and neither administration would do anything to oppose that.",
         "It's been over a year and Biden still hasn't been able to get a ceasefire done. Harris has promised she will not stop arming Israel, so what leverage does she have for a ceasefire. At a certain point you have to accept you are being lied to just like red MAGA needs to accept they are being lied to.",
         "Perhaps. But only one administration was overtly pro-Israel and did this: \n\n\u201cWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration declared on Monday that the United States does not consider Israeli settlements in the West Bank a violation of international law, reversing four decades of American policy and removing what has been an important barrier to annexation of Palestinian territory.\u201d 2019 NYT\n\nUnfortunately, because of the x thousands of votes that were not cast in protest may have ensured what you claim."

If we want to rebuild after Trump is dead and gone, we have to start at the ground level.\n\nGet yourself into local politics. Run for local offices. Work to elect state reps.

Please resubmit your post or comment without the bullying language. \n\nDo not edit it, the bot cant tell if you edited, you will just have to make a new comment replying to the same thing. \n\nYes, this comment itself does use the word.  Any reasonable person should be able to understand that we are not insulting anyone with this comment. We wanted to use quotes, but that fucks up the automod and we are too lazy to google escape characters.  Notice how none of our automod replies have contractions in them either. \n\nBut seriously, calling someone retarded is only socially acceptable because the people affected are less able to understand that they are being insulted, and less likely to be able to respond appropriately.  It is a conversational wimpy little shit move, because everyone who uses it knows that it is offensive, but there will be no repercussions. At least the people throwing around other slurs know that they are going to get fired and get their asses beat when they use those words. \n\nAlso, it is not creative. It pretty much outs you as a thirteen year old when you use it. Instead of calling Biden retarded, you should call him a cartoon-ass-lookin trust fund goon who smiles like rich father just gifted him a new Buick in 1956.  Instead of calling Mitch McConnell retarded, you should call him a Dilbert-ass goon who has been left in the sun a little too long. \n\nSorry for the long message spamming comment sections, but this was by far the feature of this sub making people modmail and bitch at us the most, and literally all of the actions we take are to make it so we have to do less work in the future.  We will not reply to modmails about this automod, and ignore the part directly below this saying to modmail us if you have any questions, we cannot turn that off.  This reply is just a collation of the last year of modmail replies to people asking about this.  We are not turning this bot off, no matter how much people ask.

The mass deportation signs at the trump rally should have been the last warning sign. \nIt is how it started in Germany. \nThe NSDAP got 44% of the vote, formed a majority in the parliament, then proceeded to dismantle the government. They removed the communists from the parliament (1), abolished term limits (2), granted new powers to the chancellor (3) and put loyalists in position of power (4). Mind you it took 6 years for the nazis to build a military and go to war (5) and 8 years between the nazis taking power and the beginning of the deportation of Jews (6). But this will be the new reality in the US.\n\n(1) The nazis burned the Reichstag, then blamed it on the communists to remove them from the parliament. This has not happened yet, but just imagine a burning of the capitol, or a similar event, followed by a removal of democratic law makers by the capitol police. This is not unthinkable. The Trump misinformation and propaganda machine has shown what it can achieve to justify a move like this.\n(2) Trump has said he aims to abolish presidential term limits\n(3) Trump loyalists in the supreme court have ruled that the president is granted immunity when conducting official acts. Equivalent to the \"Erm\u00e4chtigungsgesetz\".\n(4) Project25 aims to give the president more accessibility to appointing loyalists to government positions.\n(5) The military is already war ready so it could happen much quicker.\n(6) Internment camps have already existed in the US.",

You don't think something is going to come up in the current administration?\n\nAs for things burning, remember those \"patriots\" attacking the capitol for Trump, yeah a lot of them are in prison.\n\nAlso why would the military get involved in any of this or the capitol police? The capitol police aren't going to remove elected officials and the military sure as hell isn't going to. It's the same reason why they won't get involved in trying to prevent or remove Trump from office again. \n\nI'm not saying we shouldn't be vigilant here but I think we should be realistic that there are still a lot of things in the way of Nazi Germany 2.0 in the USA.",

         ">Results should come on the day. The entire UK result comes in overnight with paper ballots hand counted. Why can\u2019t each state in the US do the same?\n\nThere are several reasons. Please bear in mind I am not defending the system. I am just saying this is how it works and why it can be slow.\n\n1. Different states have different election laws and regulations. All have to be consistent with federal law, but states have a lot of power to run things as they will. Seven states have laws preventing them from even opening and verifying mail in ballots until election day. And I think one state (Pennsylvania? Wisconsin?) can't even begin processing those until after in-person ballots are done. States like Florida can open, verify, and tabulate mail in ballots before election day so they have those results ready to add to their in-person count at the end of the election day.\n\nThere is no national standard for voting processes or equipment, and voting districts are pretty much left to fund their own stuff. So some districts have crappy equipment. In some districts in 2019/2020, there were voting machines so old they ran Windows XP.\n\nHigh turnout inevitably leads to more equipment and process issues due to the volume.\n\n2. The ballots in the US are often crazy packed with stuff: President, governor, attorney general, sate secretary, Senator, Congressional Rep, state congress rep, mayor, sheriff, court judges, soil and water conservation officer, and more. On top of that are state and local amendments to vote on. So there is a lot to process.\n\n3. Different time zones mean polls close at different times and start working on results at different times. Florida might have its results done by the time California just closes its polls.\n\nThere are other reasons but these are a few.",
         "US. 334 million people.\n\n50 different sets of election laws because \"state's rights.\"\n\nPolls close at 6 or 7 in many states and it is not a work holiday.\n\nI'm not defending it.

They have to wait for polls to close.\n\n\nAnd mail in ballots take more time to process.\n\n\nIt's not cheating its the nature of all the different voting laws and timelines.\n\n\nThe fraud is in lying to people by saying the delay is nefarious and then doing nothing to fix it.",

You consider each state as their own country and they count their own votes, just like \"GASP\" how every other election in this world is handled lmao. \n\nYou're deluded if you think that the US is special in this regards. The only thing that you might say be similar if it's in India where there are tons of places where it's very hard to reach therefore the voting process takes longer. But the US is not like India in this regards.",
         "Sure. If we had 50 People counting for all of Germany, it would take a long time as well.\n\nYou have roughly three times as many people. Which means three times as many potential voters. And three times as many potential volunteers...",
         "Here everyone can attend the counting, does not have to be a valid voter, counting is public. I am not aware that someone from parties has to be present, but ofc they are free to attend.",
         "Reading that some states do not allow federal observers gives my the shivers. In Germany you could attend counting on a tourist visum without any formal procedure, you just go to the polling place after it closes and you can watch as long as you behave.",
         "UK hand counting is done at rate of about \u00a317 Hour ($23) and you get free coffee/tea until about 0500 when ballots are finished, locked up and taken by the police to a central location for counting.",
         "Last election a hand re-recount found more votes for Biden after trump's team demanded them.. actually, most of the hand re-recounts did. The margin of error was something like .01% though, so it made absolutely no difference.",

         "Sometimes it is 3 elections. Bundestag (Parlament) is a bit complex as you have two votes, one for your local representative and one for the ratio of parties in parliament, and they can differ, but are on same piece if paper. \n\nMost complex is the local election for city council as, depending on state, you can have a large number of votes you can spread over hundreds of candidates, depending on city size.\n\nBut that is I think never the same day as the general parliament election. Could be wrong here.\n\nBasically we have\n\n* European parliament \n\n* National parliament \n\n* Local state parliament (there is city states where this replaces everything below)\n\n* Regional parliament (a region is several counties, it is mostly an administrative entity)\n\n* County parliament \n\n* City council\n\nAnd some weird stuff called social elections which determine the ratio of several groups in some committees overseeing some social aspects.\nI think that is mail in only.\n\nHope I forgot nothing...\n\nSome states also allow direct consultation of population for certain problems.\n\nBut I think I had never more than three the same day.\n\nElection day is always a Sunday. It is not fixed, there is a window in which it has to happen, and crazy short notice elections like in UK are not possible.",
         "Another remark... You have actually 2 months to count, why does anybody expect a result the same night?\nEither you invest the resources and count fast or you wait, how long it takes.\n\nIn Germany, the first meeting of the new parliament has to take place latest 30 days after election.",

         "Well fix it. Make it one day off for voters and two for volunteers.",
         "Yup.  There were 700-800k poll workers in 2020, a Presidential election year.  We'd need 5-7 times that to hit the poster's ratio.  There was a shortage this year to even hit the baseline level, to say nothing of multiples of that number.\n\nCollege kids and elderly aren't the best recruiting pool.  Elections on a weekend, or making election day a national holiday would be helpful in addressing many of our voting issues, including poll staffing.",
         ">Sounds like you guys just need to sort out the process. The size and numbers argument doesn\u2019t wash because it\u2019s all just proportional.\n\nWhy do you think it's all proportional?\n\nVoting districts in the US are not proportional.\n\nLoving County in Texas has 64 people total.\n\nHarris County in Texas--which includes Houston--has 4.8 million residents and a voter turnout of 1.6 million for the 2020 Presidential election.\n\nToday Harris County has 700 polling places.\n\nThat's a lot of people to serve and a lot of locations to facilitate and oversee.\n\nAnd election day is NOT a holiday. So most people don't get the day off to vote or work at a polling place.\n\nSo you get older people who have the time trying to work the computers and tabulation and such.\n\nSize and numbers matter when voting districts are not proportional, frequently have equipment and supply issues (because many districts are woefully underfunded for this), are staffed by part timers who skew older, and when every recent election sees even bigger turnout than the last one.",
         ">Move your election to the weekend like most other democracies or at least make it a holiday, then you'll get enough volunteers. \n\n>Or handle it like you do jury duty and summon selected people\n\nThese are good solutions, but there is a problem: there are people who like the inefficiency.\n\nWe may hear Trump supporters moan about how results get in late, but they don't want to do anything big to fix that.\n\nOne reason is this: Republicans have long believed that they do better as a party if fewer people overall vote.\n\nThis is why they want more involved voter ID processes.\n\nIt's also why they won't make election day a holiday. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said he thought if they did that then government workers would use the day off to hang around polling places and intimidate conservative voters.\n\nNo proof offered for that supposition, of course.\n\nIf voting is more time consuming and frustrating, then fewer people will want to do it.\n\nThat, their thinking goes, creates an advantage for them since their main constituency is rural voters (places with shorter lines than big cities at polling places) and older voters (who have the time in the middle of the day to vote in person).",
         "And the instances of ballot fraud and double voting that were found turned out to be Republicans voting twice for Trump.\n\nThey believed his lies and were trying to even out the cheating by cheating themselves...but they were the only ones cheating.\n\nDan Patrick, the Republican Lt Gov of Texas offered up to $25k for tips that lead to voter fraud convictions.\n\nHe only had to pay out for people reporting Republicans.",

Because they want to claim victory before the count is complete, and claim that taking too long means the vote is corrupt.\n\nI do not understand why it works when it is so transparent what they are doing, but somehow it does.",
         "The counters required per number of voters remains the same regardless of size, so a small county only needs a few counters a large one needs more. \nStaffing, equipment and number of polling locations is what comes under needing to sort the process.",
         "The problem isn't handcounting. The problem is refusing to actually pay people to assure your elections are going well. The problem isn't the volunteers who \"can lie\", the problem is the assholes in power that don't want to pay for more of them",
         "The problem is very different. \n\nVote counting includes deciding if a vote is valid and if the voters intension is clear. That is hard with paper ballots, see the fuckups in the US with hole punching machines when several people decide if there is a hole or not.\n\nMoney counting is easy in comparison.\n\nWhy paper ballots? Because that is the only way that allows a really proper recount with a proper paper trail. A voting machine could be in theory always diverge in paper trail and counted vote. It is hard to exclude that beforehand, as you would need insight in ALL details of the machine, software and hardware (at the microprocessor design level) and even the compiler would need to be verified.\n\nGermany once did trials with machines counting kind of plastic coins being inserted into different slots, and being collected in different bags. This seems to be a good way actually, you can count during the voting process (just have to make sure nobody can see the counter or bags) and recount the coins later by hand. I am not sure why it was abandoned. May be \"ups I threw it in the wrong slot\" happened to often, no idea.",
         "In the abstract, yes.\n\nHowever, the US has stubbornly resisted making voting easier and more efficient all around for decades.\n\nInstitutional inertia is part, and \"states rights\" are a part \n\nAnother part are the people who like that it is junky. It gives then talking points and excuses for election lawsuits.",
         "The coin idea defniitely wouldn't work in America. I had something like 35 things on my ballot this year. Some of those things had as many as 6 choices. That would mean 35xchoices coins and slots. And my ballot isn't particularly complex compared to some other states."

         "It\u2019s not a mystery, nor is it a sign of Trump being popular. The election is only close because it\u2019s being decided by a handful of swing states due to the electoral college suppressing the vast majority of America.",

Their goal is to whitewash the country, and they don't care if they have to give this country cancer to do it.",

         "Curious thought loop. Everyone who leans Trump thinks because he's running = he must be a legit politician. Has plans to do the system right, even though all evidence contraindicates him being a good pick. Because he was in the office, and is running, he must have the qualificiations. Meanwhile many of the same people nominated and elected him because he's nothing like all the other people in office, hates government, hates diplomacy, hates charity, hates compromise. So they vote for him in to destroy the system and expect him to run it well, because he must if that's the job they give him.",

The poor vote for who they can relate to (Make America Great Again - Because its not so great for Me). The rich vote for who will benefit them.

I saw this as a test and even though I guess she could still pull it off it doesnt look good but we failed regardless\n\nWay way way too many people willingly made the wrong choice in spite of tons of reasons not to. We failed no matter who wins at this point\n\nAnd the problem was always going to be even if Trump lost all his supporters would still be here. Now if he wins we're going to see everything they said theyd do come to pass\n\nProject 2025. I know people who voted for Trump who will be targets. Sorry to say but they'll be on their own. I tried to help them by warning them\n\nTheyll get what they voted for. Russia now has it made. Goodbye Palestine. Anybody not in the club (christian, hetero, caucasian, male, MAGA) will be treated as non citizens\n\nThey said theyll be coming after anybody that doesnt support Trump. Well thats me. And a lot of other people. We'll see what that looks like\n\nAnd various other policies that will be bad for everyone as per usual under the GOP rule. But Im done with it. This is what they want let them have it\n\nIm tired trying to save people from themselves. My silver lining if Trump wins will be some months down the road when the shit hits the fan and everyone who voted for him gets covered theyll have only themselves to blame\n\nI wash my hands of it. I dont have the energy or inclination to fight with these idiots anymore. If by some miracle the country isnt destroyed, great.

Trump has, without a doubt, paid for several abortions. This is not a major issue for him personally, he's just doing what the Heritage foundation tells him to do, so it would be funny if ultimately Trump could have won, but lost because his handlers couldn't stop themselves from pushing their least popular position.",
