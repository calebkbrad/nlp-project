         ">Results should come on the day. The entire UK result comes in overnight with paper ballots hand counted. Why can\u2019t each state in the US do the same?\n\nThere are several reasons. Please bear in mind I am not defending the system. I am just saying this is how it works and why it can be slow.\n\n1. Different states have different election laws and regulations. All have to be consistent with federal law, but states have a lot of power to run things as they will. Seven states have laws preventing them from even opening and verifying mail in ballots until election day. And I think one state (Pennsylvania? Wisconsin?) can't even begin processing those until after in-person ballots are done. States like Florida can open, verify, and tabulate mail in ballots before election day so they have those results ready to add to their in-person count at the end of the election day.\n\nThere is no national standard for voting processes or equipment, and voting districts are pretty much left to fund their own stuff. So some districts have crappy equipment. In some districts in 2019/2020, there were voting machines so old they ran Windows XP.\n\nHigh turnout inevitably leads to more equipment and process issues due to the volume.\n\n2. The ballots in the US are often crazy packed with stuff: President, governor, attorney general, sate secretary, Senator, Congressional Rep, state congress rep, mayor, sheriff, court judges, soil and water conservation officer, and more. On top of that are state and local amendments to vote on. So there is a lot to process.\n\n3. Different time zones mean polls close at different times and start working on results at different times. Florida might have its results done by the time California just closes its polls.\n\nThere are other reasons but these are a few.",

         ">It doesn't matter when each state that is smaller than Germany does it's own counting simultaneously\n\nMaybe do some reading and research first.\n\nStates *don't* all count votes simultaneously.\n\nTime zone difference is one reason. Polls close on one end of the country while polls are still open for hours on the other.\n\nAlso, not all states count mail in and early votes the same.\n\nFlorida law let's them count their mail in ballots before election day, so they have those results on election night.\n\nPennsylvania can't start processing mail in votes until election day. That means they can't even open and verify them before then, let alone tabulate them. Six other states have similar laws.\n\nThis is why their processing takes longer and why they may not have results tonight.\n\nI could also go into the myriad of voting equipment being used that can vary from county to county. Underfunded counties struggle with bad, outdated, and malfunctioning equipment.\n\nSo no, not all ballots go to the same place to be counted. They do go to lots of different places that count ballots at different times with different processes to one another. \n\nThis is why it is more complex and time consuming than in a smaller country with a smaller voting population with fewer districts spread over a smaller physical area.\n\n>I weep for your country that you have people like you voting.\n\nRead don't cry",

So most people don't get the day off to vote or work at a polling place.\n\nSo you get older people who have the time trying to work the computers and tabulation and such.\n\nSize and numbers matter when voting districts are not proportional, frequently have equipment and supply issues (because many districts are woefully underfunded for this), are staffed by part timers who skew older, and when every recent election sees even bigger turnout than the last one.",

Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said he thought if they did that then government workers would use the day off to hang around polling places and intimidate conservative voters.\n\nNo proof offered for that supposition, of course.\n\nIf voting is more time consuming and frustrating, then fewer people will want to do it.\n\nThat, their thinking goes, creates an advantage for them since their main constituency is rural voters (places with shorter lines than big cities at polling places) and older voters (who have the time in the middle of the day to vote in person).",

         "The problem is very different. \n\nVote counting includes deciding if a vote is valid and if the voters intension is clear. That is hard with paper ballots, see the fuckups in the US with hole punching machines when several people decide if there is a hole or not.\n\nMoney counting is easy in comparison.\n\nWhy paper ballots? Because that is the only way that allows a really proper recount with a proper paper trail. A voting machine could be in theory always diverge in paper trail and counted vote. It is hard to exclude that beforehand, as you would need insight in ALL details of the machine, software and hardware (at the microprocessor design level) and even the compiler would need to be verified.\n\nGermany once did trials with machines counting kind of plastic coins being inserted into different slots, and being collected in different bags. This seems to be a good way actually, you can count during the voting process (just have to make sure nobody can see the counter or bags) and recount the coins later by hand. I am not sure why it was abandoned. May be \"ups I threw it in the wrong slot\" happened to often, no idea."

That being said, due to globalization and the rise and fall of America as the Hegemony an organization such as NATO benefits us more than other member countries. Additionally, the main draw for NATO members is to reserve their GDP for \u201cmore important\u201d matters. \n\nAll of that to me means that NATO members not paying is an issue, just not a particularly important one. Since all sides don\u2019t really benefit from paying it. I wish that the taxpayer could get a break or for those funds to be reinvested elsewhere but due to how congress does budgeting I doubt they would get reallocated anyway.",

But US farmers were decimated as China started switching to Latin American countries and signing long-term contracts for soybeans. American manufacturers realized that many of their base chemicals and ingredients -- the \"dirty\"/polluting base ingredients used in manufacturing -- were made in China. We really did have a \"global supply chain\" and we couldn't simply make everything here like it was 1946.\n\nTrump's tariffs hit **both** the US and Chinese economies in a huge, negative way. China, being a communist gov't and having deep, Asian mindsets about shared sacrifice, was positioned better to withstand the economic chaos than the individualistic capitalism and culture of the US.\n\nBut soon **both** Trump and China agreed to call off the trade war.

This isn't a \"both sides are the same\" because I believe Biden did something very important.  \n\nReality is that Tarriffs inherently aren't bad. They're just harmful and ineffective when used on their own. \n\nIn this case I believe that Tarriffs are an important piece of the puzzle. The promise of globalization was \"go and be a professional. We will retrain you. Let other countries do the heavy lifting manufacturing and we will get relatively cheap goods and you'll be able to work better jobs.\"\n\nTo start. White collar industries have a critical mass of workers they can support. Not everyone that worked in factories is going to get retrained into engineers and bankers. \n\nThe flip side of that is that there should be some level of quality vs price advantage for Made in America. There's a theoretical curve that would exist that would allow factories to function here in the US.  \n\nWhich brings us to the second problem: China and Mexico aren't playing by the rules. There's an assumption in these treaties that there's a human and workers rights cost that is paid by the manufacturing process there to maintain a standard. There are requirements on US companies that are supposed to prevent them from functionally using slave labor. \n\nThese in practicality are ignored. This drives costs down for consumers but they are driven below what is feasible to compete with on the quality/cost scale, and this kills the ability for American manufacturing to compete. \n\nThe theory is that Tarriffs balance these scales.  The idea is exactly that the consumer eventually pays the cost because it's supposed to counteract the fact that prices are driven down as a result of human rights abuses.  \n\nThe half of this that Trump ignored (because he just wanted to make it look like he did things instead of doing the work) is that you need to invest in the industries you are tariffing. Biden kept the Tarriffs and finished the job correctly by passing a massive infrastructure bill to reinvigorate American manufacturing after it was gutted as a result of globalist and consumerist policy. \n\nYes. Costs will go up. That's expected. The point is that these costs are blunted by more people having jobs to actually buy the stuff and to stimulate the economy. You can't just slap Tarriffs on things and expect it to fix things. You need to do the work to rebuild what was broken.",

These people are 1000x worse than Trump in every way that matters. Seriously, what the hell are you people smoking. Democrats go around these days defending an actual genocide and calling people who oppose literally burning children alive \"selfish\".

The fact that Bill Kristol's podcast is bragging about how they successfully took over the Democrats and it \"warms their hearts\" seeing Liberals cheer for more war and \"The most lethal military\" should maybe cause pause for people with a conscious, which most Liberals do not have these days.\n\nBut but but abortion.\n\nGive me a break, Democrats will never, ever ratify roe v wade or abortion rights, ever.

         "No, I was able to vote and the fraudulent one was rejected. There were 3 ballots in my mailbox that were stolen (and possibly more from neighbors). 2 of us went together and voted in person and one already printed out their ballot and mailed it, not sure what will happen with the printed ballot.",
         "Refusing to follow defensive treaties with an ally isn\u2019t \u201cnothing\u201d. Seriously Reddit, there just isn\u2019t a morally good option with Israel/Palestine. I just promise you the conversation in the situation room is more complicated than, \u201cPresident Biden, we have determined plan [x] to be the morally best option.\u201d And then Biden says, \u201cSorry General, but AIPAC says no can do.\u201d",
         "Doing nothing is an option that would potentially lose a key ally for intelligence and stability in a region historically unstable. Israel would quickly become a bigger target by Iran, Hezbollah, and Hamas. We very likely would see increased fighting and instability if choosing to do nothing.",
         "I'm aware. \n\nI'm just saying that if Trump wins, especially using dubious methods, people will absolutely revolt. (What that looks like, I'm not positive) \n\nIf Trump loses, his minions will claim the election was stolen and go do insane shit. \n\nSerious situation either way.",
         "Awesome, I honestly expected a turn away. Great on ya for being able to & going forward with your vote. Hope whoever the thief is gets caught red handed.",
         "Not to mention, Israel is kinda *scary* when it comes to intelligence & spying. Remember Stuxnet? If we broke our treaty with them and screwed them over, we could become their next target. The last thing we need is loose-cannon Netanyahu crashing the US power grid because we pissed him off. And right now, that craziness is on our side, mostly. \n\nBiden has pushed back consistently on Benji. That's all he can realistically do."

         "\u201cSometime shortly after Bill Clinton was elected, Republicans seemed to forget what the 1980\u2019s had actually been like and mythologize Ronald Reagan. Many of the \u201cfacts\u201d we argue over about Reagan simply aren\u2019t true.\n\nA good example is the myth that Reagan turned around the pitiful economy of Carter by cutting taxes in a supply-side effort. This ignores the fact that federal taxes consume nearly as much GDP at the beginning of Reagan\u2019s Presidency as at the end (19% to 18.4%). Federal taxes actually consumed less of GDP in Bush\u2019s 8 years than in Reagan\u2019s 8 years.\n\nIf Bush is a greater supply-sider than Reagan, then we\u2019ve got to adjust the Reagan myth a bit. While Bush never signed a single tax increase, Reagan signed several of the largest tax increases as percentages of GDP. Reagan signed tax increases every year of his Presidency except the first and the last.\n\nEven on spending Bush performed better than Reagan. During Reagan\u2019s presidency government spending was \\~22.5% of our economy. During Bush\u2019s terms government spending was only \\~19.5% of our economy.\n\nReagan benefited from a get-tough Federal Reserve that finally got inflation under control in 1982. That victory over inflation paved the way for job creation and economic growth not only that decade but also in the 1990\u2019s.\n\nHowever, Reagan did attempt deregulation, which ended up being a mixed bag of successes and failures.\n\nReagan revitalized and rebuilt the pathetic military he inherited in 1981.\n\n\\[*Doug Forrester missed a lot here, Reagan actually gutted the military through ineptitude as I was one of many in the military in various branches who lost their slots in military flight school because of Reagan. By cutting taxes so much and exploding (defense) spending, Ronald Reagan created an unsustainable situation whereby Senators Warren Rudman (R -NH), Phil Gramm (R-TX), and Ernest Hollings (D-SC ) enacted OBRA, Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (Colloquially known as \u2018Gramm-Rudman), which clamped down on the deficit spending Reagan had passed. It resulted in many of us not being able to attend flight school -Copernicus\\_Brahe*\\]\n\nReagan faced down the Soviet Union not with meaningless gestures (boycotting Olympics) but instead with might.\n\nReagan used his charisma and communication skills to re-frame our political arguments in America.\n\nWhat we need to do is detach from Reagan the myth so we can look forward realistically instead of looking back to a 1980\u2019s that never existed. This also involves facing the Bush era without comparing it to fantasy.\n\nOur party needs to get past its myths about Reagan before it can address the problems of today.\u201d\n\n\\- Doug Forrester, 2005 Republican nominee for Governor of New Jersey, writing for a conservative republican website\u2026",
