         ">Results should come on the day. The entire UK result comes in overnight with paper ballots hand counted. Why can\u2019t each state in the US do the same?\n\nThere are several reasons. Please bear in mind I am not defending the system. I am just saying this is how it works and why it can be slow.\n\n1. Different states have different election laws and regulations. All have to be consistent with federal law, but states have a lot of power to run things as they will. Seven states have laws preventing them from even opening and verifying mail in ballots until election day. And I think one state (Pennsylvania? Wisconsin?) can't even begin processing those until after in-person ballots are done. States like Florida can open, verify, and tabulate mail in ballots before election day so they have those results ready to add to their in-person count at the end of the election day.\n\nThere is no national standard for voting processes or equipment, and voting districts are pretty much left to fund their own stuff. So some districts have crappy equipment. In some districts in 2019/2020, there were voting machines so old they ran Windows XP.\n\nHigh turnout inevitably leads to more equipment and process issues due to the volume.\n\n2. The ballots in the US are often crazy packed with stuff: President, governor, attorney general, sate secretary, Senator, Congressional Rep, state congress rep, mayor, sheriff, court judges, soil and water conservation officer, and more. On top of that are state and local amendments to vote on. So there is a lot to process.\n\n3. Different time zones mean polls close at different times and start working on results at different times. Florida might have its results done by the time California just closes its polls.\n\nThere are other reasons but these are a few.",

Surely having some electronic machines (small asside: as a software engineer I wouldn't trust those as far as I could throw them) would make it faster not slower. Regardless of if they run XP they still go faster than counting paper slips. They ultimately just need to hold a handful of integers.  \n3. Even if a ballot is packed with other stuff it shouldn't be that crazy. Trippling the time it takes to process a ballot should only take it into the region of 2 days to count. Multipling it by ten times should still have it done in under a week.  \n4. 5 months is inexcusably incompetent no matter how you slice it. FIVE MONTHS.

         "If only it was so simple.\n\nMost districts and counties have to self fund for their election worker pay, so that puts a cap on how many they can have.\n\nMany poll workers are retirees who have the free time to devote a whole non-holiday workday into poll work.\n\nAnd Trump's malign influence has led to more threats against election officials. Poll workers are also rightly worried.\n\nRunning a national election in the US is a larger and more complicated task than running one in a smaller country with a single national voter system.\n\nBut the difficulty of the task has not been met with a concomitant level of resources to ensure efficiency.",
         "Some americans think this is witchcraft by the looks of it. If the country is so big it needs more work... get more workers. If you can't handle something as simple as counting, maybe the US shouldn't be a country.",
         "The US doesn't have federal elections, we have 50 state elections and thousands and thousands of county/local elections. \n\nReforming this would be a noble goal, but I believe would be deeply unpopular because \"constitution\" and \"tradition\" and \"federalism\" or whatever. \n\nI agree there are ways it could be done, but overhauling the entire election system is unpopular.",
         ">It doesn't matter when each state that is smaller than Germany does it's own counting simultaneously\n\nMaybe do some reading and research first.\n\nStates *don't* all count votes simultaneously.\n\nTime zone difference is one reason. Polls close on one end of the country while polls are still open for hours on the other.\n\nAlso, not all states count mail in and early votes the same.\n\nFlorida law let's them count their mail in ballots before election day, so they have those results on election night.\n\nPennsylvania can't start processing mail in votes until election day. That means they can't even open and verify them before then, let alone tabulate them. Six other states have similar laws.\n\nThis is why their processing takes longer and why they may not have results tonight.\n\nI could also go into the myriad of voting equipment being used that can vary from county to county. Underfunded counties struggle with bad, outdated, and malfunctioning equipment.\n\nSo no, not all ballots go to the same place to be counted. They do go to lots of different places that count ballots at different times with different processes to one another. \n\nThis is why it is more complex and time consuming than in a smaller country with a smaller voting population with fewer districts spread over a smaller physical area.\n\n>I weep for your country that you have people like you voting.\n\nRead don't cry",

On my ballot in AZ, I had over 70 different things to vote on (~15 elections, ~20 propositions (laws), and ~40 judges [Arizona is atypical in having judges on the ballot]). My understanding from lower down in the thread is that Germany rarely has more than 2 things on the ballot.

         "Sometimes it is 3 elections. Bundestag (Parlament) is a bit complex as you have two votes, one for your local representative and one for the ratio of parties in parliament, and they can differ, but are on same piece if paper. \n\nMost complex is the local election for city council as, depending on state, you can have a large number of votes you can spread over hundreds of candidates, depending on city size.\n\nBut that is I think never the same day as the general parliament election. Could be wrong here.\n\nBasically we have\n\n* European parliament \n\n* National parliament \n\n* Local state parliament (there is city states where this replaces everything below)\n\n* Regional parliament (a region is several counties, it is mostly an administrative entity)\n\n* County parliament \n\n* City council\n\nAnd some weird stuff called social elections which determine the ratio of several groups in some committees overseeing some social aspects.\nI think that is mail in only.\n\nHope I forgot nothing...\n\nSome states also allow direct consultation of population for certain problems.\n\nBut I think I had never more than three the same day.\n\nElection day is always a Sunday. It is not fixed, there is a window in which it has to happen, and crazy short notice elections like in UK are not possible.",
         "Another remark... You have actually 2 months to count, why does anybody expect a result the same night?\nEither you invest the resources and count fast or you wait, how long it takes.\n\nIn Germany, the first meeting of the new parliament has to take place latest 30 days after election.",
         ">Move your election to the weekend like most other democracies or at least make it a holiday, then you'll get enough volunteers. \n\n>Or handle it like you do jury duty and summon selected people\n\nThese are good solutions, but there is a problem: there are people who like the inefficiency.\n\nWe may hear Trump supporters moan about how results get in late, but they don't want to do anything big to fix that.\n\nOne reason is this: Republicans have long believed that they do better as a party if fewer people overall vote.\n\nThis is why they want more involved voter ID processes.\n\nIt's also why they won't make election day a holiday. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said he thought if they did that then government workers would use the day off to hang around polling places and intimidate conservative voters.\n\nNo proof offered for that supposition, of course.\n\nIf voting is more time consuming and frustrating, then fewer people will want to do it.\n\nThat, their thinking goes, creates an advantage for them since their main constituency is rural voters (places with shorter lines than big cities at polling places) and older voters (who have the time in the middle of the day to vote in person).",
         ">Sounds like you guys just need to sort out the process. The size and numbers argument doesn\u2019t wash because it\u2019s all just proportional.\n\nWhy do you think it's all proportional?\n\nVoting districts in the US are not proportional.\n\nLoving County in Texas has 64 people total.\n\nHarris County in Texas--which includes Houston--has 4.8 million residents and a voter turnout of 1.6 million for the 2020 Presidential election.\n\nToday Harris County has 700 polling places.\n\nThat's a lot of people to serve and a lot of locations to facilitate and oversee.\n\nAnd election day is NOT a holiday. So most people don't get the day off to vote or work at a polling place.\n\nSo you get older people who have the time trying to work the computers and tabulation and such.\n\nSize and numbers matter when voting districts are not proportional, frequently have equipment and supply issues (because many districts are woefully underfunded for this), are staffed by part timers who skew older, and when every recent election sees even bigger turnout than the last one.",

That is hard with paper ballots, see the fuckups in the US with hole punching machines when several people decide if there is a hole or not.\n\nMoney counting is easy in comparison.\n\nWhy paper ballots? Because that is the only way that allows a really proper recount with a proper paper trail. A voting machine could be in theory always diverge in paper trail and counted vote. It is hard to exclude that beforehand, as you would need insight in ALL details of the machine, software and hardware (at the microprocessor design level) and even the compiler would need to be verified.\n\nGermany once did trials with machines counting kind of plastic coins being inserted into different slots, and being collected in different bags. This seems to be a good way actually, you can count during the voting process (just have to make sure nobody can see the counter or bags) and recount the coins later by hand. I am not sure why it was abandoned. May be \"ups I threw it in the wrong slot\" happened to often, no idea.",

         "I feel like people really don't understand the issues with Trump's tariffs and why they failed. \n\nYou can criticize Trump on these but in reality the Biden administration kept almost all of these. This isn't a \"both sides are the same\" because I believe Biden did something very important.  \n\nReality is that Tarriffs inherently aren't bad. They're just harmful and ineffective when used on their own. \n\nIn this case I believe that Tarriffs are an important piece of the puzzle. The promise of globalization was \"go and be a professional. We will retrain you. Let other countries do the heavy lifting manufacturing and we will get relatively cheap goods and you'll be able to work better jobs.\"\n\nTo start. White collar industries have a critical mass of workers they can support. Not everyone that worked in factories is going to get retrained into engineers and bankers. \n\nThe flip side of that is that there should be some level of quality vs price advantage for Made in America. There's a theoretical curve that would exist that would allow factories to function here in the US.  \n\nWhich brings us to the second problem: China and Mexico aren't playing by the rules. There's an assumption in these treaties that there's a human and workers rights cost that is paid by the manufacturing process there to maintain a standard. There are requirements on US companies that are supposed to prevent them from functionally using slave labor. \n\nThese in practicality are ignored. This drives costs down for consumers but they are driven below what is feasible to compete with on the quality/cost scale, and this kills the ability for American manufacturing to compete. \n\nThe theory is that Tarriffs balance these scales.  The idea is exactly that the consumer eventually pays the cost because it's supposed to counteract the fact that prices are driven down as a result of human rights abuses.  \n\nThe half of this that Trump ignored (because he just wanted to make it look like he did things instead of doing the work) is that you need to invest in the industries you are tariffing. Biden kept the Tarriffs and finished the job correctly by passing a massive infrastructure bill to reinvigorate American manufacturing after it was gutted as a result of globalist and consumerist policy. \n\nYes. Costs will go up. That's expected. The point is that these costs are blunted by more people having jobs to actually buy the stuff and to stimulate the economy. You can't just slap Tarriffs on things and expect it to fix things. You need to do the work to rebuild what was broken.",

Federal taxes actually consumed less of GDP in Bush\u2019s 8 years than in Reagan\u2019s 8 years.\n\nIf Bush is a greater supply-sider than Reagan, then we\u2019ve got to adjust the Reagan myth a bit. While Bush never signed a single tax increase, Reagan signed several of the largest tax increases as percentages of GDP. Reagan signed tax increases every year of his Presidency except the first and the last.\n\nEven on spending Bush performed better than Reagan. During Reagan\u2019s presidency government spending was \\~22.5% of our economy. During Bush\u2019s terms government spending was only \\~19.5% of our economy.\n\nReagan benefited from a get-tough Federal Reserve that finally got inflation under control in 1982. That victory over inflation paved the way for job creation and economic growth not only that decade but also in the 1990\u2019s.\n\nHowever, Reagan did attempt deregulation, which ended up being a mixed bag of successes and failures.\n\nReagan revitalized and rebuilt the pathetic military he inherited in 1981.\n\n\\[*Doug Forrester missed a lot here, Reagan actually gutted the military through ineptitude as I was one of many in the military in various branches who lost their slots in military flight school because of Reagan. By cutting taxes so much and exploding (defense) spending, Ronald Reagan created an unsustainable situation whereby Senators Warren Rudman (R -NH), Phil Gramm (R-TX), and Ernest Hollings (D-SC ) enacted OBRA, Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (Colloquially known as \u2018Gramm-Rudman), which clamped down on the deficit spending Reagan had passed. It resulted in many of us not being able to attend flight school -Copernicus\\_Brahe*\\]\n\nReagan faced down the Soviet Union not with meaningless gestures (boycotting Olympics) but instead with might.\n\nReagan used his charisma and communication skills to re-frame our political arguments in America.\n\nWhat we need to do is detach from Reagan the myth so we can look forward realistically instead of looking back to a 1980\u2019s that never existed. This also involves facing the Bush era without comparing it to fantasy.\n\nOur party needs to get past its myths about Reagan before it can address the problems of today.\u201d\n\n\\- Doug Forrester, 2005 Republican nominee for Governor of New Jersey, writing for a conservative republican website\u2026",

         "The problem with all these so-called \"strong men\" is they have incredibly weak egos and can't handle the possibility of anybody else being smarter than them, and only want to put others down and get praise for their supposed genius.\n\nHitler was the exact same way:\n\n>His government was constantly in chaos, with officials having no idea what he wanted them to do, and nobody was entirely clear who was actually in charge of what. He procrastinated wildly when asked to make difficult decisions, and would often end up relying on gut feeling, leaving even close allies in the dark about his plans. His \"unreliability had those who worked with him pulling out their hair,\" as his confidant Ernst Hanfstaengl later wrote in his memoir Zwischen Wei\u00dfem und Braunem Haus. This meant that rather than carrying out the duties of state, they spent most of their time in-fighting and back-stabbing each other in an attempt to either win his approval or avoid his attention altogether, depending on what mood he was in that day.\n\n>There's a bit of an argument among historians about whether this was a deliberate ploy on Hitler's part to get his own way, or whether he was just really, really bad at being in charge of stuff. Dietrich himself came down on the side of it being a cunning tactic to sow division and chaos\u2014and it's undeniable that he was very effective at that. But when you look at Hitler's personal habits, it's hard to shake the feeling that it was just a natural result of putting a workshy narcissist in charge of a country.\n\n>Hitler was incredibly lazy. According to his aide Fritz Wiedemann, even when he was in Berlin he wouldn't get out of bed until after 11 a.m., and wouldn't do much before lunch other than read what the newspapers had to say about him, the press cuttings being dutifully delivered to him by Dietrich.\n\n>He was obsessed with the media and celebrity, and often seems to have viewed himself through that lens. He once described himself as \"the greatest actor in Europe,\" and wrote to a friend, \"I believe my life is the greatest novel in world history.\" In many of his personal habits he came across as strange or even childish\u2014he would have regular naps during the day, he would bite his fingernails at the dinner table, and he had a remarkably sweet tooth that led him to eat \"prodigious amounts of cake\" and \"put so many lumps of sugar in his cup that there was hardly any room for the tea.\"\n\n>**He was deeply insecure about his own lack of knowledge, preferring to either ignore information that contradicted his preconceptions, or to lash out at the expertise of others. He hated being laughed at, but enjoyed it when other people were the butt of the joke (he would perform mocking impressions of people he disliked). But he also craved the approval of those he disdained, and his mood would quickly improve if a newspaper wrote something complimentary about him**.\n\n>Little of this was especially secret or unknown at the time. It's why so many people failed to take Hitler seriously until it was too late, dismissing him as merely a \"half-mad rascal\" or a \"man with a beery vocal organ.\" In a sense, they weren't wrong. In another, much more important sense, they were as wrong as it's possible to get.\n\n>Hitler's personal failings didn't stop him having an uncanny instinct for political rhetoric that would gain mass appeal, and it turns out you don't actually need to have a particularly competent or functional government to do terrible things.",
