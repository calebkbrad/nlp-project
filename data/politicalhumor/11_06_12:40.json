         "I'm less surprised at the fact that a lot more people didn't vote and more surprised at the number of people that still vote for him. Mainly my fellow young 18-30 year old Americans. You'd think it'd be obvious that the guy is an un-American authoritarian.\n\nThen again, I work with these young people (it's mostly guys), and they  voted for him or supported him for a few different reasons. 1 They're painfully single-minded and self concerned. It honestly hurts and annoys me how they can't see outside of their own little bubble. America's individualism is a huge flaw. 2 Another thing is that for the guys, they're sick and tired of the \"woke\" agenda (I really hate the word \"woke.\" It's so dumb) and the aggressive push of feminism. They feel their existence as men are being invalidated, that they're being told they aren't anything, that they're the problem. They don't like transgenders as they feel it's illogical and that you're a guy or girl, and some I know even attribute it to signs of a failing society. They also connect this agenda and left leaning politics to absent fathers, single mothers, only fans creators, moral collapse, religious collapse, and immoral behaviors. 3. A lot of them believe that the complete shutdown of the southern border combined with kicking out anyone whose not a citizen or legal resident would solve a lot of problems. They think it will free up the job marke, free up housing, stop drug trade, stop illegal cartel activity, and make American cities safer. 4, they think that Trump will deregulate everything and remove a lot of laws because the attribute less government overnights into a more free and cheaper America, with disregard for what those regulations are protecting. They want to do whatever they want and think Trump will help them achieve that. But simultaneously, they're all for the government enforcing(emphasis on the forcing) others to live by your typical judeo-christian middle America, cookie cutter white American type of lifestyle. As well as higher government preventing local municipalities from creating their own local laws (see Miami vs. DeSantis over water breaks for workers in the heat). And 5, they actually think that the us pulling out from the rest of the world will help us with our debt, focus on ourselves, free up prices, save American dollars and resources, etc etc.\n\nI don't agree with most of these guys as while I have no affiliation, I'm left leaning, but these are the things I've noticed the most from these guys. Whether or not they're right or wrong, this is what they feel. And some of these guys, even when presented with info being wrong or trumps flaws they disregard. One guy I know shared an ai imagine of Trump walking in the hurricane saying this is why we need him back, and told that's not a real photo he said I don't care it's the message that matters.... he's not the brightest of these dudes I've mentioned. A lot of them are smart and decent guys, but politically, they seem to fall apart.",

Fascistic movements burn themselves out, the bitch is surviving to see that day. \n\nSome tips I'm taking personally:\n\nIf you can get pregnant, I advise getting an IUD as soon as possible before they outlaw some of our most effective birth control (this is also the best option considering they're likely to attempt and override state level abortion protection). \n\nIf you are trans and in a red state, you're either not trans anymore or you need to run to a sanctuary city. Discuss with your Healthcare provider what to do if hormone treatments become illegal and make plans for that possibility.\n\nStock up on shelf stable foods, tariffs will absolutely bite you and you'll want to make sure you have food. Also stock up on toothpaste, I don't personally know what the fuck RFK is going to do but you'll want all your basic Healthcare stuff ready. Ibuprofen, toothpaste, (possibly iodine to help treat water? though I'm not sure how much that will help the industrial pollutants we'll see from deregulation). \n\nI'd also consider planning to move to the great lakes, they're reasonably liberal and likely safe-ish politically, and as the climate crisis now accelerates, they'll be the ones safest from natural disasters.\n\nStart working out, get to know your neighbors if you don't already, and get politically organized. This will only be corrected at the local and not federal level. Good luck.",
         "\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 Today, there is no \u201cthey,\u201d only \u201cwe.\u201d We cling to that illusion of division like it\u2019s the last life raft, pretending we\u2019re not all slowly sinking into the same sea of chaos. Aren\u2019t we supposed to be Americans? Or is that just something we slap on the Fourth of July and forget about once the fireworks are over? As author and activist Arundhati Roy put it, \u201cThe war is not over; it is not even beginning; we are all in it.\u201d (Roy, Field Notes on Democracy, 2008). It\u2019s hard to pretend we\u2019re separate when we\u2019re all in the same sinking boat.\n\nAt some point, we sold our future for pocket change\u2014sacrificing any long-term hope for the shallow comfort of a few extra dollars today. A cheaper tank of gas, a little tax break, maybe even a handful of crumbs to make us feel like we\u2019ve won. And yet, most don\u2019t see how deep Project 2025 and those \u201cinnocent\u201d tariffs will cut into their lives. We\u2019ve become a nation so wrapped up in our own smugness, we\u2019re too distracted to notice the slow-motion disaster heading straight for us. As journalist Chris Hedges said, \u201cWe are a society that is on the edge of ruin, and the people are too distracted by the drama to notice.\u201d (Hedges, America: The Farewell Tour, 2018). The kicker? The ones who cheered it all on are going to be the first ones to feel the sting.\n\nIf this is MAGA\u2019s promised land, then sure\u2014bring on those falling prices, the affordable gas, the groceries that magically cost less. But my gut tells me that\u2019s about as likely as pigs flying. The idea that one person can \u201csave the economy\u201d while conveniently ignoring the rest of the world is almost adorable\u2014like watching a toddler believe that closing their eyes means they\u2019re invisible. As economist Joseph Stiglitz aptly noted, \u201cMarkets are global, and the idea that a single nation can somehow insulate itself from global forces is delusional.\u201d (Stiglitz, Globalization and Its Discontents Revisited, 2017).\n\nWhen the reckoning comes, at least we\u2019ll have the privilege of saying, \u201cwe told you so.\u201d Not that it\u2019ll make a difference. I can already hear the chorus of MAGA voices scrambling to point the finger at everyone else, even though they\u2019ve got the Senate, House, Supreme Court, and Presidency locked down. Watching them contort themselves to blame \u201cthe others\u201d when they\u2019re the only ones with their hands on the wheel will be an impressive spectacle\u2014if it weren\u2019t so painfully predictable. As political commentator Thomas Frank observed, \u201cBlaming the elites is a convenient way of not facing the reality that we, as a society, are complicit in this mess.\u201d (Frank, Listen, Liberal, 2016).\n\nThis country\u2019s moral compass is so broken, it\u2019s practically a modern art piece. We\u2019re hanging on by a thread, and any hope of a miraculous comeback feels like a bad joke. Whatever storm is coming, we rolled out the welcome mat. We earned it\u2014every dark, twisted moment of it. As historian Howard Zinn warned, \u201cThe problem is not that we are too few, but that we are too few who are willing to stand up.\u201d (Zinn, A People\u2019s History of the United States, 1980).  \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8",

A majority of older voters are active, so they are shown in the polling numbers, meaning that the polls are a more realistic representation of the more \"aged\" voting population. If all of the younger voters had turned in their ballots, Trump would most likely be a clear loser, with Harris as a majority win, because younger voters tend to be more progressive and left leaning.

During the beginning of his political career, Hitler publicly expressed favorable opinions towards traditional Christian ideals, but later abandoned them.\"\n\nIt sounds like he wasn't an atheist, but that he did abandon his Christian ideals later in his reign. Not to mention that Hitler openly criticized atheism:\n\n>\n\n>Hitler viewed atheists as uneducated, and atheism as the state of the animals.\\[72\\] He associated atheism with Bolshevism, communism, and \"Jewish materialism\".\\[196\\] Richard Overy cited Hitler's belief in racial biology as evidence of scientific views and atheism, but stated that Hitler was not a thorough atheist in that sense because of his theistic and spiritual ideologies:\\[197\\]\n\n>\n\n>Truth lay in natural science, and for Hitler that meant the truths of racial biology \u2013 natural selection, racial struggle, \"identity of kind\". Hitler was politically prudent enough not to trumpet his scientific views publicly, not least because he wanted to maintain the distinction between his own movement and the godlessness of Soviet Communism. Nor was he a thorough atheist. His public utterances are peppered with references to \"God\" and \"Spirit\". For Hitler the eschatological truths that he found in his perception of the race represented the real \"eternal will that rules the universe\"; in the infinite value of the race and the struggle to sustain it men find what they might call God, an inner sense of the unity and purposiveness of nature and history ...Such views could be detected in the development of critical theology in Germany before the First World War, which suggested that God should be experienced as inner feeling rather than as external morality... What Hitler could not accept was that Christianity could offer anything other than false \"ideas\" to sustain its claim to moral certitude.\n\n>\u2014\u200aExcerpt from The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia by Richard Overy\\[198\\]",

Why is NY 17 still in the hands of that dipshit Lawler? Mondaire Jones is a horrible candidate, and the fact that we had no one better in my district to put up is comical.\n\nAnd, instead of having a primary, we nominated a very unpopular vp. People have never felt good about her, she never polled well, and clearly, this country hates women, and minorities hate themselves, so why did we put all our faith in her rather than have a primary? Losing the Latino vote at all is unacceptable, especially after Trump's rally, and she did so poorly, Miami-Dade is now red. All the money there was sent in to her, and none of it mattered. I am so dejected. \n\nAnd, why it is that we fail to understand time and time again that money and immigration motivate people better than any other issues, and therefore we need to do a much better job of selling our economic record? We went through it the last two elections, and we learned nothing. Last time we barely squeaked by. No alarm bells.\nNow, we had the highest stakes, and we treated this election like a given. Good fucking going, folks. I know clearly half the electorate is pathetically stupid, but the insistence of playing by the rules cannot be allowed going forward-we will lose every time. America will lose evey time. There are no more rules to play by.\n\nSomeone else told me that Latinos are extremely nationalistic, and so don't care about comments made about Puerto Rico.\n\nFuck em then. \n\nWomen themselves thought a woman is unfit to be president. They saw what was happening to young girls, their own families, and actually said I am voting for the man held liable for rape. The man Jeffrey Epstein admitted was his best friend. \n\nFuck em\n\nBut the fact that this wasn't picked up on at all by the party, that no one thought to have a young candidate waiting and ready to go when they nominated Joe Biden at 75, that no one thought that a biracial woman was going to be a hard sell is astounding.\n\nTop down, the democratic leadership needs to be scrubbed. This is a failure of biblical proportions, with biblical consequences. All 3 chambers plus Scotus now belong firmly in gop hands. They gave Trump the green light to do anything. \n\nWelcome to the new fucking age here, people.",

         "\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 Today, there is no \u201cthey,\u201d only \u201cwe.\u201d We cling to that illusion of division like it\u2019s the last life raft, pretending we\u2019re not all slowly sinking into the same sea of chaos. Aren\u2019t we supposed to be Americans? Or is that just something we slap on the Fourth of July and forget about once the fireworks are over? As author and activist Arundhati Roy put it, \u201cThe war is not over; it is not even beginning; we are all in it.\u201d (Roy, Field Notes on Democracy, 2008). It\u2019s hard to pretend we\u2019re separate when we\u2019re all in the same sinking boat.\n\nAt some point, we sold our future for pocket change\u2014sacrificing any long-term hope for the shallow comfort of a few extra dollars today. A cheaper tank of gas, a little tax break, maybe even a handful of crumbs to make us feel like we\u2019ve won. And yet, most don\u2019t see how deep Project 2025 and those \u201cinnocent\u201d tariffs will cut into their lives. We\u2019ve become a nation so wrapped up in our own smugness, we\u2019re too distracted to notice the slow-motion disaster heading straight for us. As journalist Chris Hedges said, \u201cWe are a society that is on the edge of ruin, and the people are too distracted by the drama to notice.\u201d (Hedges, America: The Farewell Tour, 2018). The kicker? The ones who cheered it all on are going to be the first ones to feel the sting.\n\nIf this is MAGA\u2019s promised land, then sure\u2014bring on those falling prices, the affordable gas, the groceries that magically cost less. But my gut tells me that\u2019s about as likely as pigs flying. The idea that one person can \u201csave the economy\u201d while conveniently ignoring the rest of the world is almost adorable\u2014like watching a toddler believe that closing their eyes means they\u2019re invisible. As economist Joseph Stiglitz aptly noted, \u201cMarkets are global, and the idea that a single nation can somehow insulate itself from global forces is delusional.\u201d (Stiglitz, Globalization and Its Discontents Revisited, 2017).\n\nWhen the reckoning comes, at least we\u2019ll have the privilege of saying, \u201cwe told you so.\u201d Not that it\u2019ll make a difference. I can already hear the chorus of MAGA voices scrambling to point the finger at everyone else, even though they\u2019ve got the Senate, House, Supreme Court, and Presidency locked down. Watching them contort themselves to blame \u201cthe others\u201d when they\u2019re the only ones with their hands on the wheel will be an impressive spectacle\u2014if it weren\u2019t so painfully predictable. As political commentator Thomas Frank observed, \u201cBlaming the elites is a convenient way of not facing the reality that we, as a society, are complicit in this mess.\u201d (Frank, Listen, Liberal, 2016).\n\nThis country\u2019s moral compass is so broken, it\u2019s practically a modern art piece. We\u2019re hanging on by a thread, and any hope of a miraculous comeback feels like a bad joke. Whatever storm is coming, we rolled out the welcome mat. We earned it\u2014every dark, twisted moment of it. As historian Howard Zinn warned, \u201cThe problem is not that we are too few, but that we are too few who are willing to stand up.\u201d (Zinn, A People\u2019s History of the United States, 1980).  \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8",

Those were his words. That was his promise in 2020. \n\nHe did not do what he said he was going to do.",
         "In 2017-2021, Trump was at least kept somewhat in check by people who cared for the Constitution. But now he has purged all of those, and instead surrounded himself with people who do whatever he wants, no matter the consequences. Remember when Pence stopped Trump from clinging to power despite losing the election? Trump has made sure he won't be stopped like that anymore. If you think the next four years are going to be the same as Trump's first term, you're in for a rude awakening.",

Trump will bow before Putin, cancel all support for Ukraine and pressure them to capitulate. This very much increases the probability of a direct war between Russia and all of Europe, because Putin will be assured by his victory in Ukraine and the weakness of the West/NATO to continue his wars of conquest.

         "We\u2019ve got work to do, folks. Cry, shake our heads, and then get to work.\n\nThe federal government is going to be severely weakened over the next four years. It\u2019s time to do what the Democrats should have done fifty years ago - focus on the state governments.\n\nThat\u2019s how the Republicans have put themselves where they are. They long ago understood the bottom-up approach to control. Democrats have been focused so much on top-down that they lost sight of that.\n\nWe have to stop pinning our hopes on the presidency every four years. If we want to rebuild after Trump is dead and gone, we have to start at the ground level.\n\nGet yourself into local politics. Run for local offices. Work to elect state reps. Find Democrats who resonate locally.  Do the work to get them put in the smaller seats of power that form the base for the bigger seats of power.\n\nIt\u2019s the only way forward.",

They just have gigantic cities. Trump got 3 million votes in California and 3 million votes in Pennsylvania.\n\n\nI would love Pittsburgh to grow and attract more Democratic voters to the city.

         "She did not do well in democratic primaries for a reason. Unless the democratic primaries are also sexist, it has more to do with the fact that she was part of an administration that wasn\u2019t particularly well liked AND she didn\u2019t really resonate with voters. Until she was essentially given the nomination, she was basically out of sight. If people love you, Biden is not keeping you off of TV. \n\nHad there been a primary, she wouldn\u2019t have come close to winning.

Hopefully the Dems can use the next two years to regroup, campaign hard in the mid-terms and find a way to amp up their voters and start shoring up their losses in Congress so they can actually *do* something when they get back into the White House.",

Tariffs will affect the price of every day goods no?\n\nIf the price of everything goes up by 10-20%, we would need like a 50% tax break to help offset that.",
         "You're not wrong, but the description for issue 1 was ridiculously confusing. While voters should feel bad for not educating themselves. It also exemplifies the ignorance of being taken advantage of.\n\nIssue 1 was written in bipartisan language. However, if you didn't educate yourself prior to casting your vote, Issue 1 read like a horror story.\n\nBasically, Issue 1 gave the idea that voting yes meant you couldn't hold any appointed officials responsible for any disagreements (which was true). However, the compromise was that there would be an even split of appointed officials (x amount of Democrats and x amount of Republicans).  \n\nPeople don't want to lose, what they don't even use.",

         "I'm mad too. How can people feel like they can rightfully complain and yet do absolutely nothing to try to solve the perceived issue? Is it laziness or hopelessness? Should we adopt a mandatory voting system like in Australia? I'm just so confused.",
         "Don\u2019t be mad at the lack of dems who didn\u2019t vote. Be mad at the DNC for not seeing that putting out their best candidate was a better option than just forcing Kamala on us. Thai country still is influenced by white males and they needed to lead with that.",

That umbrella includes religious zealots who literally believe a woman should never be POTUS. It includes minority cultures who think that women are unfit to lead. It includes minority groups who hate other minority groups. It includes nationalities that hate other nationalities. And it includes idealists for niche issues who will not vote unless their particular niche issue is addressed, even if that issue directly opposes another group in the umbrella.  \n  \nThese races are won by 5%.  \nTrimming 1% for Group A, 1% for Group B, sacrificing Group C to pander to Group D. All it does is trim margins from a race won by margins. Choosing anything but a safe bet is dumb when EVERYTHING is on the line.   \n  \nBiden *barely* won and the DNC thought a combination of multiple hated demographics into one person would do well?

         "\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 Today, there is no \u201cthey,\u201d only \u201cwe.\u201d We cling to that illusion of division like it\u2019s the last life raft, pretending we\u2019re not all slowly sinking into the same sea of chaos. Aren\u2019t we supposed to be Americans? Or is that just something we slap on the Fourth of July and forget about once the fireworks are over? As author and activist Arundhati Roy put it, \u201cThe war is not over; it is not even beginning; we are all in it.\u201d (Roy, Field Notes on Democracy, 2008). It\u2019s hard to pretend we\u2019re separate when we\u2019re all in the same sinking boat.\n\nAt some point, we sold our future for pocket change\u2014sacrificing any long-term hope for the shallow comfort of a few extra dollars today. A cheaper tank of gas, a little tax break, maybe even a handful of crumbs to make us feel like we\u2019ve won. And yet, most don\u2019t see how deep Project 2025 and those \u201cinnocent\u201d tariffs will cut into their lives. We\u2019ve become a nation so wrapped up in our own smugness, we\u2019re too distracted to notice the slow-motion disaster heading straight for us. As journalist Chris Hedges said, \u201cWe are a society that is on the edge of ruin, and the people are too distracted by the drama to notice.\u201d (Hedges, America: The Farewell Tour, 2018). The kicker? The ones who cheered it all on are going to be the first ones to feel the sting.\n\nIf this is MAGA\u2019s promised land, then sure\u2014bring on those falling prices, the affordable gas, the groceries that magically cost less. But my gut tells me that\u2019s about as likely as pigs flying. The idea that one person can \u201csave the economy\u201d while conveniently ignoring the rest of the world is almost adorable\u2014like watching a toddler believe that closing their eyes means they\u2019re invisible. As economist Joseph Stiglitz aptly noted, \u201cMarkets are global, and the idea that a single nation can somehow insulate itself from global forces is delusional.\u201d (Stiglitz, Globalization and Its Discontents Revisited, 2017).\n\nWhen the reckoning comes, at least we\u2019ll have the privilege of saying, \u201cwe told you so.\u201d Not that it\u2019ll make a difference. I can already hear the chorus of MAGA voices scrambling to point the finger at everyone else, even though they\u2019ve got the Senate, House, Supreme Court, and Presidency locked down. Watching them contort themselves to blame \u201cthe others\u201d when they\u2019re the only ones with their hands on the wheel will be an impressive spectacle\u2014if it weren\u2019t so painfully predictable. As political commentator Thomas Frank observed, \u201cBlaming the elites is a convenient way of not facing the reality that we, as a society, are complicit in this mess.\u201d (Frank, Listen, Liberal, 2016).\n\nThis country\u2019s moral compass is so broken, it\u2019s practically a modern art piece. We\u2019re hanging on by a thread, and any hope of a miraculous comeback feels like a bad joke. Whatever storm is coming, we rolled out the welcome mat. We earned it\u2014every dark, twisted moment of it. As historian Howard Zinn warned, \u201cThe problem is not that we are too few, but that we are too few who are willing to stand up.\u201d (Zinn, A People\u2019s History of the United States, 1980).  \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8",

After Washington declined to run in 1976, that was supposed to happen, but it never did.\n\nThe equal representation by state in the senate was 100% a power grab by small state delegates, though later the balance of the senate had a lot to do with how new slave states and free states were admitted. During the constitutional convention, slavery was much more pertinent to the 3/5ths compromise \u2014 which, to be clear, should have been 0/5ths at most; -5/5ths would be better.

Blaming us or the Green Party for standing by our principles is just ignoring the real issue: a party that can\u2019t hold onto its own because it\u2019s too busy talking out of both sides of its mouth.\n\nAnd about Gaza, before you talk about moral high ground, remember that the devastation there has already amounted to the equivalent of two nuclear bombs\u2019 worth of destruction. You can check sources on this if you don\u2019t believe it. The Democrats\u2019 silence or complicity in this kind of devastation is a stain on any claim to moral authority they might pretend to have.",

         "She\u2019s been doing this for years. I remember during the Obama vs Romney election thinking about voting stein being disillusioned with both parties and even back then there were ties to Russia, which ultimately kept me away.",
         "Let\u2019s clear something up: the claim that Jill Stein \u201ctakes money from Putin\u201d is flat-out false. This is classic mainstream media (MSM) propaganda, designed to smear anyone who challenges the two-party system. The narrative that Stein is somehow tied to Russia has been debunked countless times, yet people keep repeating it because MSM keeps pushing it, knowing most people won\u2019t look any deeper.\n\nThis kind of misinformation is exactly why we end up with candidates like Trump. People swallow these stories without questioning them, and it leads to a dumbed-down political discourse where voters don\u2019t know what\u2019s real and what\u2019s not. If you\u2019re seriously looking for a villain in this mess, maybe take a look at the mainstream news sources that keep feeding people this kind of garbage to distract from the real issues. Trump\u2019s win should be proof enough that our population isn\u2019t that sharp about sorting truth from spin and unfortunately, it seems like you\u2019re falling for it too.\n\nEdit: someone wanted me to point out one of these debunkings then blocked me. It\u2019s really easy. \n\nThe Senate Intelligence Committee is one of the most powerful investigative bodies in the country. They spent years, with access to classified intelligence, resources, and bipartisan oversight, to dig into every corner of potential Russian influence. If there had been anything remotely incriminating about Jill Stein\u2019s connections, they would have found it and broadcast it. But the fact is, after extensive investigation, they found no evidence of wrongdoing on her part.\n\nMeanwhile, the mainstream media (MSM) is a big part of how we ended up with Trump by sensationalizing or underplaying stories when it suits them. They were more focused on ratings than holding people like Trump accountable from the start. So it\u2019s hypocritical to take every MSM headline at face value now when it comes to anyone challenging the status quo. The Senate cleared Stein. People need to stop playing around with these baseless narratives and focus on the real issues MSM should have been covering all along.",

The best chance democrats have is to find the policies that intersect the most in the Venn Diagram, and hope those policies unite each of the distinct groups.  \n  \nUnfortunately, half of the democratic party fail to grasp this, and so they find little issues that were unaddressed and use them as their \"pRoTeSt\". Democrats have an amazing ability to sabotage themselves. If you just add a little bit of Russian backed influencers to the scale, then each lil group is going to think their group is the big one and that their issue is the big one.  \n  \nIt's childish.  \nDemocrats need to accept that a lot of fringe Democrats and independents are racists and misogynists and religious zealots, and we need to stop selecting candidates that instantly eliminate those groups from our umbrella.

So so childish. Risking the end of democracy, risking the collapse of the US into fascism, TO BE HEARD.  \n  \nAnd this was exactly the stance the Russian farms pushed into social media.

Despite his immense wealth he still maintained an image of \u2018you could have what I have\u2019 that the average American responds to. He doesn\u2019t strike people as an ivory tower life long politician, and that is clearly paying dividends.\n\nThe man has a playbook that works and until we accept that and start dissecting why we are unable to replicate it, instead of just throwing out statements about how he\u2019s wrong/insane/cheating or whatever - we\u2019re doomed.",
         "Nailed it. Shit I already know but I feel like if it\u2019s spelled out people won\u2019t actually internalize the knowledge. They have to be prodded into seeking out the answers themselves so that they arrive at these conclusions organically. Being told this stuff just doesn\u2019t seem to sink in. I was trying 130 days ago when people were telling Biden to step down but absolutely no one would listen.",

         "In all fairness to Harris, I've read some other people put it very well:\n\nThe only thing demanded of Trump was he had to be mildly coherent, and he barely hit the bar (and some people even disagree on that).\n\nIt was demanded that Harris had to flawless in absolutely everything, and she did really well for what she was handed, but she wasn't flawless.",

         "His turnout is roughly the same as 2020 probably a bit less.  Population increases every year, vote counts tend to go up.  My point is he didn't rally some massive huge number of people to the cause.    The same MAGA idiots who always loved him and voted for him in 2020 did so again.  Sure he likely gained some supports and maybe lost  few but for the most part his base is the same people in 2024 as it was in 2020.  It wasn't some unbeatable coalition to win in 2024 Democrats just had to vote in similar numbers as 2020 and they didn't not even close.\n\nIf Trump had racked up 85M votes that would show some major shift in popularity of his viewpoints in general.  There has been no shift. Likewise if there was a massive increase in third party candidate votes that might indicate a different sort of change but that didn't happen either.  **Trump won (again) because a huge number of non-MAGAs just kinda forgot you actually have to vote every election.**\n\nTrump's popularity is still less than 50%.  It isn't some tidal change in public opinion.  **It just doesn't matter what non-voters think.**  They had a chance to turn their opinion into action and chose to sit on the couch instead.",
         "Ah, I think when you refer to \"the dems\" you are referring to the DNC and the Democrats in charge. When I refer to \"the dems\" or \"the right\", I'm referring to the voters at large. Those of us who did vote are under no disillusionment of the cause of the fuck-up (even if its hard to fathom). We have people who just did not show up.\n\nConversely, when Trump lost in 2020, it was all \"they must have cheated\", \"stolen election\", \"storm the capitol\"... Blaming the democrats for their loss, instead of themselves.",
         "They're right-wingers and bear a lot of similarity to MAGA, but they're not usually actually MAGA- more the palette-swapped version where they exchanged the MAGA \"American empire good\" for \"American empire bad\", but otherwise kept basically all the same shitty ideas and lack of nuance or familiarity with reality.",
         "Yes, if there's a very tiny silver lining, his win is comprehensive enough that it can't be pinned on any one demographic.  I don't know if that makes it better, but the fact is more than 70% of eligible voters are fine with him, either by voting for him, or just sitting it out.  It's depressing what that tells you about humanity.  Agreed she was a weak candidate who furthermore got blamed for everything Biden, but it was also her job as a candidate to present herself as a departure from Biden.",
         "I don't think Biden would have won, but Democrats really know to lose election",

         "yup, not an american so my terminology may be off.",
         "Hillary lost to Trump as a white woman.  Dem leadership saw that and ran... A black woman!  \n\nMost people don't know the issues.  They don't consume political news.  Most people are just struggling to get by, living paycheck to paycheck, and don't see national politics changing that.  They see \"angry old white man\" and \"nice middle-aged black woman\" and then they stay home from the polls.",
         "They sure do.  But somehow DNC leadership lives on while we have to deal with this shit for another 4 years",
         "DNC and RNC laugh all the way to the bank every election. As long as both parties survive. We are just their playthings",

We wanted to use quotes, but that fucks up the automod and we are too lazy to google escape characters.

So for everyone not paying attention this sets us back at least 80 years, if we're lucky and that's presuming we get out from under an Imperial America under Emperor Trump anytime soon.\n\nWe know that President-Elect Trump has stated plainly he means to declare himself emperor/dictator and it's unlikely he'll leave office while he's alive.\n\nWe have a raft of 200+ Presidential directives authored by some very intelligent, very motivated and very fascist grand strategy thinkers over at Project 2025 , who will be over the moon ,busily dismantling the federal protections and targeting competencies and architecture of governance built over the last 250 years transforming the Republic into a non-competent [kakistry dictatorship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakistocracy) tailored to Russian and Chinese grand strategic interests over the next couple of years.\n\nThe only hope here, is that by virtue of sheer incompetence those appointed to dismantle the Federal Republic fail in some areas, but it's probably very much in the interests of any future hope for the re-establishment of competent federal goverance that Democratic Governors form a sub-federal alliance to fund and support the flight of competence and know-how that is sure to come in the next few days, as sort of a mini \"Operation Paperclip\" to retain talent and knowhow\" at the state level since it will be exterminated at the Federal level if it does not meet with the will of President Trump or Director of Government Efficiency Overseer Elon Musk.\n\nWe should expect that China Russia and whomever else is willing to pay, will instantenously close whatever technological, industrial or strategic information gap that the United States had. They will within 2 or 3 years have every scientific and technological advantage the US or the West more broadly might have enjoyed. \n\nThis means the Ukranian War almost certainly will see a much, much harder fight fought entirely by NATO - the United States , with Russia and Ukranian adversaries fielding US equivalent technologies as fast as they can be developed. This is true in China, Iran, and every other nation state which is exceptionally bad for civics and international security. \n\nWhat happens to civil liberties domestically, it's 1920 again, with defacto concerns about travel and your personal rights, Women , Latinos, Homosexuals of any stripe, Black folks are facing at least 4 years of hardship that will resemble something from 100 years ago.\n\nIDK about anyone else but I'm going to rewatch [Andor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-asb8zTiuZ4) I think.....and see how best to help ourselves get squared away for the long road ahead and to help those most vulnerable to safety.",

No liberals to blame. \n\nIt took three years of disastrous conservative inaction in the face of the great depression (which they'd caused) and the dust bowl for America to elect the most liberal government in our history In 1932. That government and its successors were so effective, powerful, successful that a conservative couldn't get elected to the white house for 36 years. Thirty Six. \n\nObama had the chance to hold their feet to the fire in 2008, to point out to a knocked-down nation that conservative leadership and policies had produced the greatest financial crisis since 1929, wiped away their savings and lost them their homes, plunged a financially interwoven world into a global economic crisis. \n\nBut he chose not to. Let's fix this together, was the message, as conservatives fought him at every step after pledging, not to help rebuild America, not to work together to advance the interests of Americans, but to make Obama a one-term president. \n\nIf Trump keeps his campaign promises, the next four years are going to be a moral and financial and national security holocaust.

We've shown that we'll do stupid shit like leave and we just can't be trusted to behave in a reliable and consistent manner. We damaged our reputation.\n\nFor the US it's going to be on an even bigger scale. I feel like in 2016 they kind of forfeited their place at the head of the table for a while, and it seemed like Merkel stepped in to some extent and was a steadying influence on things. But Merkel is gone and the world is a more volatile place than it was back then. The world needed someone from a genuine superpower to take the lead and that's not going to be Trump. I think the US has forfeited their seat once more and I don't know if they'll be able to get it back again. i think it'll take a lot for the world to trust the US again. Even if they elect someone sensible in 2028, how do we know they won't elect De Santis, Vance or some Trump spawn in 2032?

         "Popular vote count for 2024 & 2024 which you can find in wiki for 2020 and any news page or google result for 2024.\n\n2020 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election\n* Biden-2020\t\t 81.3M\n* Trump-2020\t\t 74.2M\n* Total-2020            155.5M\n\n2024  https://www.google.com/search?q=popular+vote+total+2024\n* Harris-2024\t\t66.4M (so far)\n* Trump-2024\t\t71.4M (so far)\n\n\nNow there is about 15M votes left to be counted in 2024 and we don't yet know exactly how it will split but we can make some reasonable assumptions. The late vote tends to break slightly to the left.  Not 50:1 or even 3:1 as some in denial right now are hoping but slightly to the left.  Trump's high water mark then is likely an even 50/50 split of the remaining vote so 7.5M more.  A more realistic 40/60 split would be 6M/9M.  A very generous (and unlikely) 35/65 split for Harris would be would be about 5M/10M.\n\nSo the final vote count for 2024 is likely to be in the range of:\n* Harris-2024\t\t74M - 76M\n* Trump-2024\t\t76M - 78M \n* Total-2024           ~150M\n\nNow that means Trump did go up slightly but keep in mind voting age population has increased by roughly 2% since 2020.  So adjusted for \"voter inflation\" Trumps 2020 vote count would be 75.6M in 2024 which is right down the middle of the range of likely final count.  He got roughly the same level of support as 2020 so that isn't why he won.  Anyone saying we don't know exactly sure I concede that if you want to wait for the last ballot to be counted that is fair but Trump's level support will be roughly (keyword roughly) the same as 2020.\n\n**Harris however won't get anywhere close to Biden**.  The magnitude of the gap is shocking to me.  Lets be honest most people weren't freaking out with excitment over Biden he just was a solid if boring candidate for 2020. Non-MAGAs saw the threat that Trump was in 2020 and voted in large numbers to ensure helost.  If Harris got even close to Biden given Trump didn't really expand his base (an unknown factor prior to election day) she would probably be President elect right now.  Prior to the election there was some uncertainty/fear that Trump would greatly expand his base and Trump vote count would be 80M+ which would make a Harris win very tough but that didn't happen meaning he was easily beatable if non-MAGA voters simply showed up.\n\nDemocrats just fell asleep. It seems to be a cycle.  Low turnout, bad shit happens, high turn out, apathy back to low turnout.  Democrats will probably be breaking voting records in 2026/2028 rallied by all the terrible shit the GOP is going to unleash in the next two years but that doesn't undo the Trump win \"we\" (collectively) handed to him on a silver platter.\n\nMy final prediction is Trump will die (naturally) prior to 2029 meaning he will never face justice for anything.

The Trump misinformation and propaganda machine has shown what it can achieve to justify a move like this.\n(2) Trump has said he aims to abolish presidential term limits\n(3) Trump loyalists in the supreme court have ruled that the president is granted immunity when conducting official acts.

The capitol police aren't going to remove elected officials and the military sure as hell isn't going to.

We wanted to use quotes, but that fucks up the automod and we are too lazy to google escape characters.

It is a conversational wimpy little shit move, because everyone who uses it knows that it is offensive, but there will be no repercussions. At least the people throwing around other slurs know that they are going to get fired and get their asses beat when they use those words. \n\nAlso, it is not creative. It pretty much outs you as a thirteen year old when you use it. Instead of calling Biden retarded, you should call him a cartoon-ass-lookin trust fund goon who smiles like rich father just gifted him a new Buick in 1956.

The Virginia legislature, realizing it was going to be tight, switched to the winner take all system to increase Jefferson's chance of winning the presidency. Massachusetts, where Adams was from, not to be outdone, did the same and then each state, one by one followed suit until we basically ended up with the system we have today.

We wanted to use quotes, but that fucks up the automod and we are too lazy to google escape characters.

At least the people throwing around other slurs know that they are going to get fired and get their asses beat when they use those words. \n\nAlso, it is not creative. It pretty much outs you as a thirteen year old when you use it.

         "Hello! Thanks for your comment. Unfortunately it has been removed because you don't meet our karma threshold.\n\n You are not being removed for political orientation.  If we were, why the fuck would we tell you your comment was being removed instead of just shadow removing it?  We never have, and never will, remove things down politicial or ideological lines. Unless your ideology is nihilism, then fuck you. \n \n Let me be clear: The reason that this rule exists is to avoid unscrupulous internet denizens from trying to sell dong pills to our users.  /r/PoliticalHumor mods reserve the RIGHT to hoard all of the dong pills to ourselves, and we refuse to share them with the community.  If you want Serbo-Slokovian dong pills mailed directly to your door, become a moderator. If we shared the dong pills with the greater community, everyone would have massive dongs, and like Syndrome warned us about decades ago: \"if everyone has massive dongs, nobody does.\"\"\n \n If you wish to rectify your low karma issue, go and make things up in /r/AskReddit like everyone else does. \n\n Thanks for understanding! Have a nice day and be well. <3\n \n You can check your karma breakdown on this page:\n \n http://old.reddit.com/user/me/overview\n \n (Keep in mind that sometimes just post karma or comment karma being negative will result in this message)\n \n ~\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/PoliticalHumor) if you have any questions or concerns.*",
