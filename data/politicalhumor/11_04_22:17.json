         "\u201cSometime shortly after Bill Clinton was elected, Republicans seemed to forget what the 1980\u2019s had actually been like and mythologize Ronald Reagan. Many of the \u201cfacts\u201d we argue over about Reagan simply aren\u2019t true.\n\nA good example is the myth that Reagan turned around the pitiful economy of Carter by cutting taxes in a supply-side effort. This ignores the fact that federal taxes consume nearly as much GDP at the beginning of Reagan\u2019s Presidency as at the end (19% to 18.4%). Federal taxes actually consumed less of GDP in Bush\u2019s 8 years than in Reagan\u2019s 8 years.\n\nIf Bush is a greater supply-sider than Reagan, then we\u2019ve got to adjust the Reagan myth a bit. While Bush never signed a single tax increase, Reagan signed several of the largest tax increases as percentages of GDP. Reagan signed tax increases every year of his Presidency except the first and the last.\n\nEven on spending Bush performed better than Reagan. During Reagan\u2019s presidency government spending was \\~22.5% of our economy. During Bush\u2019s terms government spending was only \\~19.5% of our economy.\n\nReagan benefited from a get-tough Federal Reserve that finally got inflation under control in 1982. That victory over inflation paved the way for job creation and economic growth not only that decade but also in the 1990\u2019s.\n\nHowever, Reagan did attempt deregulation, which ended up being a mixed bag of successes and failures.\n\nReagan revitalized and rebuilt the pathetic military he inherited in 1981.\n\n\\[*Doug Forrester missed a lot here, Reagan actually gutted the military through ineptitude as I was one of many in the military in various branches who lost their slots in military flight school because of Reagan. By cutting taxes so much and exploding (defense) spending, Ronald Reagan created an unsustainable situation whereby Senators Warren Rudman (R -NH), Phil Gramm (R-TX), and Ernest Hollings (D-SC ) enacted OBRA, Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (Colloquially known as \u2018Gramm-Rudman), which clamped down on the deficit spending Reagan had passed. It resulted in many of us not being able to attend flight school -Copernicus\\_Brahe*\\]\n\nReagan faced down the Soviet Union not with meaningless gestures (boycotting Olympics) but instead with might.\n\nReagan used his charisma and communication skills to re-frame our political arguments in America.\n\nWhat we need to do is detach from Reagan the myth so we can look forward realistically instead of looking back to a 1980\u2019s that never existed. This also involves facing the Bush era without comparing it to fantasy.\n\nOur party needs to get past its myths about Reagan before it can address the problems of today.\u201d\n\n\\- Doug Forrester, 2005 Republican nominee for Governor of New Jersey, writing for a conservative republican website\u2026",

         "The problem with all these so-called \"strong men\" is they have incredibly weak egos and can't handle the possibility of anybody else being smarter than them, and only want to put others down and get praise for their supposed genius.\n\nHitler was the exact same way:\n\n>His government was constantly in chaos, with officials having no idea what he wanted them to do, and nobody was entirely clear who was actually in charge of what. He procrastinated wildly when asked to make difficult decisions, and would often end up relying on gut feeling, leaving even close allies in the dark about his plans. His \"unreliability had those who worked with him pulling out their hair,\" as his confidant Ernst Hanfstaengl later wrote in his memoir Zwischen Wei\u00dfem und Braunem Haus. This meant that rather than carrying out the duties of state, they spent most of their time in-fighting and back-stabbing each other in an attempt to either win his approval or avoid his attention altogether, depending on what mood he was in that day.\n\n>There's a bit of an argument among historians about whether this was a deliberate ploy on Hitler's part to get his own way, or whether he was just really, really bad at being in charge of stuff. Dietrich himself came down on the side of it being a cunning tactic to sow division and chaos\u2014and it's undeniable that he was very effective at that. But when you look at Hitler's personal habits, it's hard to shake the feeling that it was just a natural result of putting a workshy narcissist in charge of a country.\n\n>Hitler was incredibly lazy. According to his aide Fritz Wiedemann, even when he was in Berlin he wouldn't get out of bed until after 11 a.m., and wouldn't do much before lunch other than read what the newspapers had to say about him, the press cuttings being dutifully delivered to him by Dietrich.\n\n>He was obsessed with the media and celebrity, and often seems to have viewed himself through that lens. He once described himself as \"the greatest actor in Europe,\" and wrote to a friend, \"I believe my life is the greatest novel in world history.\" In many of his personal habits he came across as strange or even childish\u2014he would have regular naps during the day, he would bite his fingernails at the dinner table, and he had a remarkably sweet tooth that led him to eat \"prodigious amounts of cake\" and \"put so many lumps of sugar in his cup that there was hardly any room for the tea.\"\n\n>**He was deeply insecure about his own lack of knowledge, preferring to either ignore information that contradicted his preconceptions, or to lash out at the expertise of others. He hated being laughed at, but enjoyed it when other people were the butt of the joke (he would perform mocking impressions of people he disliked). But he also craved the approval of those he disdained, and his mood would quickly improve if a newspaper wrote something complimentary about him**.\n\n>Little of this was especially secret or unknown at the time. It's why so many people failed to take Hitler seriously until it was too late, dismissing him as merely a \"half-mad rascal\" or a \"man with a beery vocal organ.\" In a sense, they weren't wrong. In another, much more important sense, they were as wrong as it's possible to get.\n\n>Hitler's personal failings didn't stop him having an uncanny instinct for political rhetoric that would gain mass appeal, and it turns out you don't actually need to have a particularly competent or functional government to do terrible things.",

Please resubmit your post or comment without the bullying language. \n\nDo not edit it, the bot cant tell if you edited, you will just have to make a new comment replying to the same thing. \n\nYes, this comment itself does use the word.  Any reasonable person should be able to understand that we are not insulting anyone with this comment. We wanted to use quotes, but that fucks up the automod and we are too lazy to google escape characters.  Notice how none of our automod replies have contractions in them either. \n\nBut seriously, calling someone retarded is only socially acceptable because the people affected are less able to understand that they are being insulted, and less likely to be able to respond appropriately.  It is a conversational wimpy little shit move, because everyone who uses it knows that it is offensive, but there will be no repercussions. At least the people throwing around other slurs know that they are going to get fired and get their asses beat when they use those words. \n\nAlso, it is not creative. It pretty much outs you as a thirteen year old when you use it. Instead of calling Biden retarded, you should call him a cartoon-ass-lookin trust fund goon who smiles like rich father just gifted him a new Buick in 1956.  Instead of calling Mitch McConnell retarded, you should call him a Dilbert-ass goon who has been left in the sun a little too long. \n\nSorry for the long message spamming comment sections, but this was by far the feature of this sub making people modmail and bitch at us the most, and literally all of the actions we take are to make it so we have to do less work in the future.  We will not reply to modmails about this automod, and ignore the part directly below this saying to modmail us if you have any questions, we cannot turn that off.  This reply is just a collation of the last year of modmail replies to people asking about this.  We are not turning this bot off, no matter how much people ask.
