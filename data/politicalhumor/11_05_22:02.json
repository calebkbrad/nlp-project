So you can see where they hang out (which is usually enough to give you a very good idea of who they are), before deciding to actually read any of their comments.  \n\nOur man here is a bit of an exception in that he's more of flat out troll - doesn't hang out at the usual spots as much as just spread shit in places he's not wanted.

         "My parents are voting for Trump and it's 100% because they were brainwashed by Fox News.",

By stoking resentment on both sides of the issues.\n\nRussian troll farms were caught promoting AND disparaging BLM, trans-rights, and literally any other issue where they could effectively split the US down the middle.\n\nWhy do they do this? Because the way our democracy works. It takes compromise in order to achieve anything. If no one is willing to budge, look what happens? Budget gets held up for Ukraine. \n\nThe Russians are absolutely poking and trolling around the Israel/Gaza issues for the same reason.\n\nWe all need to be very very aware of Russian disinformation, it\u2019s not always trying to get you to change your mind.

         ">Results should come on the day. The entire UK result comes in overnight with paper ballots hand counted. Why can\u2019t each state in the US do the same?\n\nThere are several reasons. Please bear in mind I am not defending the system. I am just saying this is how it works and why it can be slow.\n\n1. Different states have different election laws and regulations. All have to be consistent with federal law, but states have a lot of power to run things as they will. Seven states have laws preventing them from even opening and verifying mail in ballots until election day. And I think one state (Pennsylvania? Wisconsin?) can't even begin processing those until after in-person ballots are done. States like Florida can open, verify, and tabulate mail in ballots before election day so they have those results ready to add to their in-person count at the end of the election day.\n\nThere is no national standard for voting processes or equipment, and voting districts are pretty much left to fund their own stuff. So some districts have crappy equipment. In some districts in 2019/2020, there were voting machines so old they ran Windows XP.\n\nHigh turnout inevitably leads to more equipment and process issues due to the volume.\n\n2. The ballots in the US are often crazy packed with stuff: President, governor, attorney general, sate secretary, Senator, Congressional Rep, state congress rep, mayor, sheriff, court judges, soil and water conservation officer, and more. On top of that are state and local amendments to vote on. So there is a lot to process.\n\n3. Different time zones mean polls close at different times and start working on results at different times. Florida might have its results done by the time California just closes its polls.\n\nThere are other reasons but these are a few.",
         "US. 334 million people.\n\n50 different sets of election laws because \"state's rights.\"\n\nPolls close at 6 or 7 in many states and it is not a work holiday.\n\nI'm not defending it.

They have to wait for polls to close.\n\n\nAnd mail in ballots take more time to process.\n\n\nIt's not cheating its the nature of all the different voting laws and timelines.\n\n\nThe fraud is in lying to people by saying the delay is nefarious and then doing nothing to fix it.",

Hand counting is so fast that it is not worth the effort to change to machines. Different people count two times, if the result doesn't match, check again. All of that happens in the election evening. We close the polls at 6pm, at usually around 10 there is a pretty solid result, already counted at least twice. It is not that many votes per poll station, the counting does not take that long.",

Polls close on one end of the country while polls are still open for hours on the other.\n\nAlso, not all states count mail in and early votes the same.\n\nFlorida law let's them count their mail in ballots before election day, so they have those results on election night.\n\nPennsylvania can't start processing mail in votes until election day. That means they can't even open and verify them before then, let alone tabulate them. Six other states have similar laws.\n\nThis is why their processing takes longer and why they may not have results tonight.\n\nI could also go into the myriad of voting equipment being used that can vary from county to county. Underfunded counties struggle with bad, outdated, and malfunctioning equipment.\n\nSo no, not all ballots go to the same place to be counted. They do go to lots of different places that count ballots at different times with different processes to one another. \n\nThis is why it is more complex and time consuming than in a smaller country with a smaller voting population with fewer districts spread over a smaller physical area.\n\n>I weep for your country that you have people like you voting.\n\nRead don't cry",

Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said he thought if they did that then government workers would use the day off to hang around polling places and intimidate conservative voters.\n\nNo proof offered for that supposition, of course.\n\nIf voting is more time consuming and frustrating, then fewer people will want to do it.\n\nThat, their thinking goes, creates an advantage for them since their main constituency is rural voters (places with shorter lines than big cities at polling places) and older voters (who have the time in the middle of the day to vote in person).",

Because that is the only way that allows a really proper recount with a proper paper trail. A voting machine could be in theory always diverge in paper trail and counted vote. It is hard to exclude that beforehand, as you would need insight in ALL details of the machine, software and hardware (at the microprocessor design level) and even the compiler would need to be verified.\n\nGermany once did trials with machines counting kind of plastic coins being inserted into different slots, and being collected in different bags. This seems to be a good way actually, you can count during the voting process (just have to make sure nobody can see the counter or bags) and recount the coins later by hand.

If youre wondering how Trump still has so many supporters its bc they dont actually care about the country. They never did\n\nEver heard the expression \"better to rule in hell than serve in heaven\"? Thats their mindset. Theyre fine with turning America into a smoking crater filled with horseshit as long as they get to sit on top and everyone they hate is buried underneath\n\nThey know Trump will take the country into a nose dive and crash but its ok bc their guy is the pilot. Its all about \"WINNING!\" and owning the libs\n\nFor a short while anyway. They end up losing too soon enough. But pissing off the libs is the main goal. If I had a dollar for every MAGA that saud theyre voting for Trump just bc he pisses off the libs Id be a wealthy man\n\nThats the whole appeal. Even make America great again narrative. They dont want to actually make it great. To them America was \"great\" before all these people got their rights\n\nBlacks, women, gays....anyone that wasnt a heterosexual christian conservative caucasian male was not considered equal. Thats what they want back. \n\nThey want an America that is dominated by them legally and constitutionally. Total control over all others. Trump more or less promised that and in the last month or two that message has become crystal clear\n\nThere should be no confusion. They dont care about America. They just want to be fascists but still be seen as the heroes bc the good guys always wear red white and blue no matter what they do\n\nNot hard to understand. Theyre scared. Scared of losing power. Scared of being treated how theyve treated others forever. Scared of equality. Scared of equity. Scared theyll be judged by their actions and character and not by the color of their skin.

Meanwhile many of the same people nominated and elected him because he's nothing like all the other people in office, hates government, hates diplomacy, hates charity, hates compromise.

         "Yes that is true and I think that a lot of NATO members don\u2019t pay their fair share without significant pressure. That being said, due to globalization and the rise and fall of America as the Hegemony an organization such as NATO benefits us more than other member countries. Additionally, the main draw for NATO members is to reserve their GDP for \u201cmore important\u201d matters. \n\nAll of that to me means that NATO members not paying is an issue, just not a particularly important one.
