      "comments": [
         "A very large chunk of libertarians voted for Trump.",
         "He was just a bad candidate.  Honestly, the LP is such a joke.  There really needs to be something better.",
         "Nobody is going to take the Libertarian Party seriously until the Libertarian Party takes themselves seriously.",
         "Chase Oliver was a weak candidate.  It also didnt help Chase Trump was actively courting libertarians in a way a Republican hasn\u2019t since Calvin Coolidge.\n\nThe Ron Paul being floated as someone to work with Elon also gave us some tingles in the week before the election.",
         "It wouldn't matter if Ron Paul himself had run with 80's Ross Perot on the same ticket.\n\nI honestly don't think the US can go back from this two-party system at this point.  I put my vote to him, even if he is a clown, just to say \"I reject this D/R bullshit\", and no one gives a shit.\n\nFight local, ignore the big offices - for now.",
         "Unfortunately the Libertarian Party has a history of sabotaging itself. Just look at [Dancing Underwear Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BAOiGTizU4) or Nick [\"I got physically assaulted\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63AgZqwk4Sg) Sarwark",
         "Good. Chase Oliver was a terrible candidate. The Libertarian Party needs to realize that we're tired of them nominating clowns",
         "The entire party needs a reboot. I've seen more organization in a stampede.",
         "Libertarian Party had a fair bit going for it once upon a time, Johnson/Weld was a ticket that I was proud to have voted for. Shame it\u2019s devolved into a complete joke and is now going to end up fifth nationally",
         "We should give up on presidential races and put the money in targeted local elections. Chase's result is embarrassing.",
         "LP is not ready for Primetime. \n\nLocally, they don't even support state legislation that they believe in. If a L did not propose the bill they won't discuss it.\n\nSo short sited.",
         "The LP cannot move forward without serious candidates. They should be focusing more on local elections. Revenue and membership is at an all time low, even the Mises Caucus is feeling the strain.",
         "Chase Oliver is an idiot and a joke. Got what you deserved. Liberty is not the same as Anarchy",
         "It's impossible for the third party to perform tolerable on the national level with ANY candidate. First, it should try to win or at least make a name for itself on the local level. And use gained authority to climb higher.\n\nAny results below 5% are statistically insignificant and should not be compared to each other.",
         "Yep. This party sure knows how to get me excited and then nominate some middle of the road candidate that has no change of moving the needle. \n\nLet\u2019s all be real nice to Dave Smith. I believe he has a shot to make an impact in the near future",
         "I still voted for him, but yeah, he was a weak candidate.\n\nAt the very minimum, he could have tried getting on Joe Rogan and Tim Pool.",
         "Now would be a good time to choose and focus on preparing the next candidate.",
         "Libertarians did themselves a favor this election by nominating a weak candidate. Because of this many libertarians ended up voting for Trump which helped him get his win especially in those rustbelt states. If they nominated a better candidate, perhaps Kamala Harris would be our next president\u2026",
         "i\u2019m an independent and it was stein vs oliver for me, she won me over with her stance on agriculture and water supply and oliver won me over with his stance on education. essentially i chose health over education with this one but there shouldn\u2019t be any animosity of any 3rd party groups, just civil disagreements and we should do a better job of that general support of one another to make the 3rd parties option more visible and impactful in future elections. this 2 party system needs to be splintered immediately.",
         "Turns out, most people aren't ok with transitioning kids or paying for the transitions of prisoners. \n\nAnd if you don't make the effort to give them anything else to talk about they just aren't going to have much reason to show up. \n\nAnd that's without going into how for once we had one major party candidate who at least _wasn't_ backed by the warmonger neocons.",
         "I was undecided up until a few days ago but was probably going to vote for Oliver. It may have been done just as a stunt but getting Ron Paul on board to help eliminate government waste sold me.",
         "Bring back Gary Johnson",
         "Predictable.  I\u2019m a registered and Lifetime member of the LP and I didn\u2019t vote for the ticket.  Give me better than this.",
         "Quite a few libertarians voted Trump \n\nFuck Chase Oliver though",
         "Yeah Oliver was a turnoff. A libertarian who held views contrary to libertarianism. What could go wrong?",
         "Dave smith 2028, gonna hit 10% choke. But hopefully it\u2019s enough to scare the republicans into doing something about the federal reserve",
         "If the libertarian party was smarter we would run candidates as republicans",
         "This was the first time I had to write in the libertarian candidate, what a clown show",
         "I had no idea who was even running until 2 weeks ago",
         "There were no libertarians on my ticket at all. I only had 4 choices for President/VP.",
         "I am so surprised the Dems didn\u2019t attempt a primary and just threw support behind Harris.",
         "Yeah... why DID he get the nomination?  I didn't think they could do worse than Jo Jorgensen, but boy did they manage to prove me wrong.",
         "I found it weird that the guy I would vote for was publicly supporting Trump already.",
         "The Libertarian party might as well cease to exist and reform as a PAC for libertarian-leaning Republican candidates in the future if they have no interest in actually supporting their candidates for office. The two party system is a corrupt shackle on our representation, but the current state of our third parties is an embarrassment as well.",
         "The LP is infamous for putting the dumbest candidates up for President. The LP would be better off sticking with local and state govt positions for right now.",
         "I'm literally subscribed to this sub and barely knew a thing about him. 3rd party is a waste of time and energy. Best option is to get libertarian minded candidates into one of the dominant parties. Last real effort was Rand Paul in 16, but he was just a shadow of his father, and got steamrolled by Trump \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb",
         "Neither party ever had a candidate",
         "...or maybe we swayed to vote for Red or even the Blue?",
         "It was definitely a combination of Oliver being dreadful and Ron Paul potentially working with Trump to clean things up.",
         "I voted for Jo last election and Gary the election before that, but Chase was an incredibly weak candidate and I simply do not like him. I wrote in Ron Paul.",
         "Al the 3rd parties need to try and combine into a single party, then maybe they can garner enough votes to get attention. Possibly on the debate stage like Perot",
         "Chase Oliver wants taxpayer funded gender conforming surgeries for illegal aliens and prisoners",
         "If you look at direct spend and indirect spend/effort, it really comes down to insane levels of marketing effort.  Whether it's the green party or libertarian party, it will take billions of dollars of marketing to lift the awareness and buy-in.  Just my 2 cents.",
         "I voted Libertarian all the way down the ticket... below Pres/VP. There's no way I was going to risk handing the country over to Kobamala and the Commies.",
         "Wheres Gary Johnson at!!",
         "Yes, because Chase Oliver is a bad candidate who did absolutely no real campaigning. I think I saw maybe 1 or 2 instances of any news or public appearances out of him between nomination & election day. Unlike Joe Biden in 2020 he doesn't have an entire media apparatus assisting him.",
         "I thought it was obvious that the LP went with Oliver to keep from nominating a candidate who would take voters from Trump.",
         "Chase Oliver wasn\u2019t a serious candidate",
         "Yes, I was involved in the national LP leadership in 1996. After the grotesque corruption around the National Convention, I quit.\n\nThey hand-pick some candidate they like for BS reasons, and quietly help him get nominated, every election.\n\nSo they pretty much never have anyone who can take advantage of the disdain that most people have for the Uniparty duopoly.\n\nAnd they get what they deserve.",
         "I bet a lot of money on Jill Stein to win even though I support this party. I\u2019ll take it",
         "Trump was right, they like losing because they refuse to compromise on anything, and now they have pie on their faces. They deserve it.",
         "LP had no chance even then, plus Ron Paul wants to be on Elon's team.",
         "The absolute state of American libertarianism. Sigh.",
         "LP candidate wasn\u2019t even on my ballot this year (illinois)",
         "This also is what happens when the party itself refuses to support the candidate chosen at the convention. Is the schism in the LP foreshadowing what we\u2019ll see in the major parties ten years from now? Would we be better off with right or none smaller parties?",
         "He was a weak candidate who ran a weak campaign. He made zero noise. All his twitter posts were generic LP talking points. I had a feeling Jill Stein was going to get more votes simply due to name recognition (her third time running for president) and that people who want the war with Israel/Gaza to end were all moving towards her or even Trump. Any other LP candidate should have been able to pick up former rfk voters and staunch antiwar libertarians but he couldn't do it because he just sucked... And Trump was just making the right moves getting tulsi, rfk, Elon, Vivek, and others to support him. Any LP candidate would have struggled but I think still could have performed better than Oliver.",
         "The Republicans have actually tried to reach out to Libertarians. The Democrats apparently didn\u2019t think it was necessary to appeal to us at all. \n\nTrump promised to put a Libertarian in his cabinet, it was a better bet to have *some* influence with a party with a shot at winning vs. voting for Oliver and getting no concessions from whatever party actually won. \n\nFreeing Ross, crypto friendly regulations, free speech are all things Libertarians would value that we very well might get from Trump. Harris was going to be far worse on nearly every topic libertarians care about.",
         "Realistically it wouldn\u2019t matter who we ran. Especially in the context of the lnc - because around that time our opponents were two former presidents and a *Kennedy*. Yeah good luck idc who you are. Even Dave Smith who would have been an amazing candidate would have got rocked this year. Smith/Russell 2028!",
         "No puberty blockers to kids.",
         "You're a weak party, candidates are the least of your worries",
         "I\u2019m sorry who is this demo voting for Jill\u2019s t3in?",
         "Why don\u2019t all minor parities unite for voting reforms? ranked a choice voting is a popular option. Not saying it\u2019s the best. approval voting is another option. There needs to be a better way to break the duopoly.",
         "We could\u2019ve done what the dems did and pretended we were excited about a bad candidate until we became so fake we convinced ourselves it was real excitement.",
         "We\u2019re never going to get anywhere until we begin winning elections at the local and state level. I voted for a libertarian county commissioner in 2020, and voted for him again this year. Setting our sights immediately on the White House is doing nothing but setting ourselves up for failure especially when the candidates suck. I was proud to vote for Jorgensen in 2020 and Johnson in 2016 but a libertarian did not get my presidential vote this time around.",
         "Chase was worse than Gary Johnson round 2. Still confused about the pick.",
         "I was gonna write in Ron Paul but he is suppose to be on the trump transition team. I liked a lot of what his coalition is about. I don't trust he will keep his word on much. But if it gets people like Massie and rand Paul incharge. I can stomach it",
         "Voted for Jo last election. Idk how you all feel about her, but I\u2019m all down for being a giant Switzerland.",
         "No, this is what happens when you have incompetent leadership",
         "It's currently 223 291...",
         "The choice here was easy, and I voted for him for a few reasons:\n\n1.) He\u2019s the candidate closest to my values as a Libertarian.\n\n2.) The two-party duopoly needs to be challenged.\n\n3.) He\u2019s the youngest candidate running by a landslide.\n\n4.) He\u2019s not running on a platform of hate/stupidity like Trump or on a platform of anti-Trump like Harris.\n\nYes, he\u2019s not the \u201cmost perfectest\u201d libertarian that could have been nominated, but to act as if any of the other candidates better embody libertarian values at all is ridiculous.",
         "Libertarians never win the election ever, I don't know why it's even an option on the list for people to vote, it's always either red or blue. Either way, I'm just glad we get a break from all the woke nonsense for the next 4 years.",
         "I cannot believe RFK still got over half a million votes after dropping out and explicitly telling people to not vote for him. \n\nLike that is as wasteful of a vote as you could get",
         "I've said this and got downvoted for it",
         "I cringed every time an edgy teenager posted they voter for Oliver",
         "I think bigger than anticipated at the end, with Ron Paul being responsive.",
         "Because Oliver was a shit show to start and can go F himself.",
         "I really think Ron Paul\u2019s comments on working with Elon in the days working up to the election really helped tip the scale here",
         "I am one of those. Because Oliver was a worse candidate than Jo Jorgensen and I predicted he wouldn't even get one percent of the vote I didn't think it would be this bad where RFK Jr beat him. The LNP needs to take a long look in the mirror how do you not even get 1 percent of the vote with so much anti-war energy.",
         "Yeah, to stop shit like this from democrats.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinformation_Governance_Board",
         "Yes, i did. The angry left wing LP got their big primary victory and nominated the third place guy nobody liked outside of far left LGBT activists. This is what they wanted.",
         "Or Kennedy",
         "Because slapping huge tariffs on everything is more libertarian friendly than believing in COVID (no, not suggesting steps a government should take in that kind of situation, just believing in COVID).",
         "Yea I decided to as well",
         "jo jorgensen was decent in my opinion. she\u2019s what lead me to find out about libertarian",
         "the ideology is there but the charismatic public figure is lacking, in due time that person will come.",
         "They weren't even on the ballot in New York (although to be fair neither were the greens) - I had to write someone in.",
         "Nobody is going to take the libertarian party until the libertarian party starts actually wanting to grow as well",
         "I often wonder if they're full to the brim with agents provocateur.\n\nEither that, or they're mind-blowingly stupid.\n\nBrave doesn't think blowingly is a word. Brave is mind-glowingly stupid.",
         "We deserve every bit of this.",
         "Chase Oliver also went out of his way to alienate half of his own party. He bashed Ron Paul, he called the great Lew Rockwell a \"racist\", and he seemed more interested in starting drama with other libertarians than actually campaigning.",
         "Yeah I remember reddit making a big deal about how Trump got booed at the Libertarian Nation Convention - well at least he bothered to show and make his case. Biden and Kamala wouldn't do something like that.",
         "I think it would take someone like Ron Paul, but maybe even more traction, getting a deep primary run then running as an independent. And even that might not be enough.",
         ">I honestly don't think the US can go back from this two-party system at this point. \n\nI wish we more like Canada or the UK where they have multiple parties and they're far more left than the United States.",
         "I had to unfollow him on everything. I used to turn to his page as a voice of reason until about 2 years ago. I have no idea what happened.",
         "If the LP wants me to care, they'll nominate a libertarian.",
         "Chase Oliver is about as libertarian as Trotsky",
         "Genuine question: How is Chase Oliver an Anarchist?",
         "The last statement is false. Chase is not an anarchist",
         "Chase never claimed to be an Anarchist, at best he was more Minarchist.",
         "With the utter lack of a campaign he ran, I'm not sure he realized he was running.",
         "Oliver was on my ticket in MN and I was surprised to see a libertarian running for one of our senate seats (Rebecca Whiting). She ended up getting 1.7% of the vote to Oliver\u2019s 0.5% which shows his weakness.",
         "Jo was based AF, I would love to have her back",
         "You seem like a real libertarian, you are for limited choice? \ud83d\ude44",
         "Dude, if you don't like wokeness, get ready. It's going to be front and center for the next four years. Trump baits people and pours gasoline on any fire he can. You're about to hear from more angry woke people than ever.",
         "I not a trump supporter but him coming to the LPC and telling libertarians he would free ross...was a pretty nice olive branch we dont normally get.",
         "I voted for chase, but not because I cared about chase. My state was going Trump for sure so I used my vote to help draw attention to 3rd parties and maybe (but apparently nowhere near this time) get that 5%.\n\nTrump certainly has my attention with Ron Paul though. If I was in a swing state that probably would have been enough to earn my vote.",
         "If I were registered, I'd've voted for Ron Paul, ergo for Trump, because of that last bit about Paul being part of the coming Trump administration.\n\nThey should've done that months ago. A LOT of libertarians don't normally bother to register. The national LP has tended to do more harm than good to the cause of liberty.",
         "I think it's because the Democrats and their cheer-leading media is just that bad and people's conscience told them they can't just vote their conscience.  Their tone and their policies would further gut the middle class while telling them all they are crazy/racist/ignorant.  At least with Trump you don't have to worry about the media gaslighting and lying about how great he is.  The fourth estate eviscerated the last decent and possibly electable people to run: Gary Johnson, Ron Paul.  President Donald Trump, brought to you by the lying media and terrible leftist policies.",
         "It was what did it for me. Himming and hawing, then Ron Paul possibly working with Elon to cut waste? Deal.",
         "It's not like the LP has had a good candidate in, like, thirty years.",
         "*5th place. Also yeah I agree.",
         "what does covid have to do with this?",
         "Yes, I spent a bunch of time with her when she was the VP candidate in 1996. She's great, the closest they've had to a good, principled candidate in decades.",
         "She was a great candidate.  I really liked her.",
         "She was definitely one of the best ones we have had running in the last couple decades",
         "She was one of the best Libertarian candidates of the 2000s+",
         "Same, I always thought that after the whole Gary Johnson debacle the LP was a joke, until I heard about Jo and her policies.",
         "Nah she was pretty bad not as bad as Oliver. The Anti-racist stuff was a joke and alienated a lot of Libertarians.",
         "No she wasn't we were facing the biggest affront to liberty with lockdowns and covid crap and she gave like no pushback was very lackluster and didn't attract much attention.  We need someone who can talk a big game spread the message and be able to kick ass and take names, she was no where near that.",
         "She really was. I even donated to her campaign.",
         "she is for sure",
         "Same in Illinois",
         "Same in Tennessee",
         "If reading this sub frequently is any indicator, libertarians love bashing other Libertarians.\u00a0",
         "What does it say about your party when that's all it takes to get your votes?",
         "What are Chase\u2019s unlibertarian opinions",
         "She was just virtually unknown outside the party and wasn't really that exciting. She was maybe too based lol",
         "Jo was as exciting as stale Triscuit crackers.",
         "No, I'm just saying that's all there ever is.",
         "This might actually be the best a main party candidate has ever done at courting libertarians. It's not much, and I bet it amounts to even less, but hey, it's something I guess.",
         "Definitely was respectable at least. I didn\u2019t vote tho",
         "Ross was ordering HITMEN\u2026 dude deserves some jail time for felony conspiracy. But the drug shit\u2026 the whole drug war. Hopefully it\u2019s a sign that he\u2019ll end that\u2026 or at least solely focus on opiates and open up the asylums\u2026 but idk",
         "Even if it's a small chance, it's worth the bet to me, because ain't no way anything libertarian is coming from the other side.",
         "I actually liked Gary Johnson in 2016. He definitely wasn\u2019t perfect but definitely better than Jorgensen and far better than Oliver.",
         "What?  You didn't like Bob Barr?  \nLP nominations seem to usually be selected to troll libertarians.  We dare you to vote for this guy.",
         "I mean, people don't like him mainly because they think he's a COVID-lockdown-supporting-basically-a-commie-democrat type of guy, when his policy platform is literally standard libertarianism.\n\nIt was really just an example to contrast with a VERY non-libertarian Trump policy that people will turn the blindest eye to just because he pretends to sympathize with libertarians sometimes.",
         "The infamous tweet heard round the party",
         "And the the excuses afterwards saying that she just wasn't familiar with what \"anti-racist\" implied.  She's an academic and a presidential nominee. I don't buy for a minute she was unfamiliar with the term. She put it in a tweet, FFS!",
         "i didn\u2019t claim she was the best.",
         "That\u2019s the party\u2019s fault not hers.",
         "It\u2019s so annoying- they\u2019re so afraid to give people a choice\u00a0",
         "Damn libertarians; They ruined libertarianism!",
         "It is Chase\u2019s most libertarian quality",
         "Touche \ud83d\ude06",
         "Someone showing up and trying to earn your votes? That can mean a lot to a lot of people.\u00a0",
         "3rd parties in the US don't really exist to \"win\". They exist to get candidates from the two other major parties to steal our ideas and implement them. The socialists and progressive parties at the turn of the previous century got a lot of what they wanted (8 hour workday, end to child labor, etc.) without getting a single presidential electoral vote. It's possible the LP essentially dies now that the Republicans have finally stolen all of our ideas, and at this point maybe it's a good thing. \n\nI've run as an LP candidate, voted big-L Libertarian now in 7 presidential elections, and I, of course, voted for Chase Oliver, but that's only really because I don't trust Trump to actually put someone like Ron Paul and Elon Musk in charge of a department of government efficiency. If they actually follow through with it, I don't know what else the LP will exist for.\n\nThere's a possibility the LP continues to exist in some form because I don't think a Trump presidency is going to actually make significant changes to the level of control the military industrial complex has, but if the GOP actually becomes the party of smaller government, actually defends the first and second amendments, then what will be the point of the LP?",
         "Tbh I voted for him because I liked his ideals best out of everyone. I wasn\u2019t going to vote for Trump again and I wasn\u2019t happy to vote Harris. So I looked elsewhere. I read up on him and watched the Third Party debate. I assume most people hate him because he\u2019s anti-war. Imo, his policies were mostly what I was looking for, so he got my vote. Simple as that.",
         "There were 5 choices on my ballot. Was yours different?",
         "Yeah, the diehard LPs were shitting on it at the time, but this was the most consideration I've ever been paid by a major party.  He actually noticed us and took the time to address us as a bloc and discuss issues we cared about on our terms instead of pretending we don't exist.  Obviously he didn't pledge to become a libertarian but I feel like him reaching out to libertarians was a small but important step to a lot of the small ls out there.",
         "Was there anything that even came close? I remember 2016 and 2020 (the first only ones I voted in) and it don't even remember any lip service to libratarians",
         "no he wasnt and you know it.",
         "Never convicted on that and never even made it to court.",
         "Bob Barr, the guy the LP bragged that they helped REMOVE FROM OFFICE because he was a neocon drug warrior...and then made their own nominee?\n\nI don't see how that could be trolling...\n\nWait, wait, how about Johnson, who refused to commit to legalizing drugs, and they gave him the nomination twice.\n\nOr in 1996, when Harry Browne told me personally that they FORCED him to change his platform, in return for help getting the nomination, and then they FORCED other libertarians to endorse him.",
         "She controls her messaging, wearing a mask outside saying how you are following all the rules come on.",
         "So what is better about Trump, compared to Harris, when it comes to Libertarian values?",
         "And the LP is still pretending to be an actual party?",
         "Yes, but tell me when the last time was we had a libertarian president?",
         "And if it actually does lead to a change in governance, it's about as good of an outcome you can really hope for right now. I'm (very) cautiously optimistic.",
         "Reagan in 1980 I suppose.",
         "Barr worked with libertarians after his removal from office and helped make medical marijuana real for four years. As much as you might despise Bob Barr, he was one of the major reasons why we have legalized recreational marijuana in the US today. I really think libertarians underestimate just how big of a deal flipping him was.",
         "Yeah come on wtf why would a person running for office follow the laws smh",
         "Not gaslighting citizens with all the media they own and calling them uneducated/racist/greedy when you disagree with them. Calling Trump a threat to democracy when they appointed their own nominees. They support genocide and endless foreign aid to the point inflation is at a record high. Harris and Biden both have track records of incarcerating low income people of color for victimless crimes like selling drugs to truancy. Trump pardoned all those people and did something no candidate has done in my lifetime, and that\u2019s acknowledge third party candidates and asking libertarians for their help.

I'm not making a prediction, but I think we're closer than we've ever been to a victory in this area.\n\nI disagree with your view on Presidential immunity, however. It is the job of Congress and the courts to keep Presidents in line and this has always been a political matter; if Presidents feared criminal prosecution by the next administration (which, given the wide ideological swings we have experienced over the past few election cycles, isn't too far-fetched) they would be effectively paralyzed. Perhaps you think that is a good thing, but the President does have certain legitimate powers that he needs to be able to exercise.\n\nThe Supreme Court did not rule that Presidents are above the law, only that actions taken in the course of their \"core constitutional powers\" have absolute criminal immunity and that other acts taken as part of a President's official duties carry a presumption of immunity. The specifics of what this all means will need to be decided in future cases, but I hardly think the Court's ruling represents a sea change at least in practice.",

There is a reason the house only has a 2 year term and the president has a 4 year term.  The house was supposed to have the most power.   We have slowly eroded away the checks and balances over the last 200 years.  \n\nWe need to abolosh the 435 member house cap and get back to 1 representative per 200-250k people.  Undo the 17th amendment and restore the appointment of senators by the states to represent the states, abolish the 16th amendment allowing the federal government to directly tax the people and require all bills that need  funding to be originated in the house.

Because more damage could be caused by then due to the lack of clarification now.\n\nHappy to hear a rebuttal",

Since the Bush era, the polarization has certainly made the overreach of the executive more pronounced in its illustration.\n\nThe wrong solutions keep getting deployed by both sides: let\u2019s get our person in there. Instead: let\u2019s limit the overreach and ensure congress does it roles in legislation and is more directive in its representation.\n\nWe need to find a way to incentivize congress to do its job, instead of delegating to the executive and judiciary.\n\nRelegating the congress to choose the president is simply a recreation of the parliamentary system across the pond, introduces more biases, and erodes more checks and balances. We need the executive to be independent like the founders intended and more in check, just like other branches.",

         "I think right now, everyone in congress defers their power to the executive and judiciary. This way, they never have to be accountable for any controversial legislation and can ensure a higher likelihood of getting re-elected. And, that can go on forever because there\u2019s no term limits, so that\u2019s their incentive.\n\nWe need them to do their job. Maybe if we place term limits, it may actually lend to them doing some of it because they can\u2019t rely on cashing their checks with the government for most of their lives.\n\nIt still may not incentivize them, but the current rules certainly don\u2019t.\n\nAbout your last point, I wish we had way more parties like parliamentary systems, but instead we have two bloated parties. It was the response to curb checks and balance within congress and government as a whole. It\u2019s a big middle finger to the founders, unfortunately, and we\u2019ve all gone along with it for generations and hard to stop it now"

         "How does involuntary labor work in prisons? I\u2019m curious. Do people get beat if they don\u2019t meet rock breaking quotas or something? Or is it work in exchange of something?",
         "Let\u2019s also be real. If you did a crime worthy of requiring work to reduce sentence you probably were not just arrested for a DUI",

         "In Louisiana they have a work release program that basically allows inmates to work outside in the real world with everyone else. Granted it's usually factory work. I worked with a few of them at a Chicken processing plant for a few years and I'll be completely honest that job sucked so bad my hands killed me every day worst job ever. However these guys didn't get time off of there sentences the only perk was they got paid and didn't spend their entire day in lockup.  They only received $2 an hour of their pay. The company pays minimum wage but the Parish  takes all but the $2 an hour to cover room and board at the jail. Now I actually agree with this mostly. The problem is if your prisoner is working then you shouldn't be getting the same amount of tax dollars to cover that inmate from the state. But they do so they try and have as many inmates as possible on work release so they can take in the extra money from their wages.",

I hate to break it to you.\n\nAnd the majority of people in prison, are violent. (Just facts)\n\nSo while I totally appreciate where you are trying to go here, it just isn\u2019t reality and not the kind of situation that frequently happens anymore.",
         "Well, yeah. Simple is better.\n\nBut that\u2019s not a strawman, bro.",
         "Let\u2019s complicate things then. When my dad worked for the prison system the cost per inmate to the taxpayers was about 35k per year depending on the security level of the prison. It\u2019s a little higher now but that\u2019s the last definitive number I have. Correctional Industries uses inmate labor to offset some of those costs. They are literally paying a debt to society. There are definitely problems with how our prison system operates but forcing inmates to work isn\u2019t one of them. Especially since it goes directly towards the burden of keeping them incarcerated. They have a debt to pay and giving them free room and board with tons of free time shouldn\u2019t solely rest on my tax dollars",
         "I'm glad they have the opportunity to do that. My complaint is the parish is double dipping. If an inmate is able and willing to work and generate cash flow to pay for their \"room & board\" typically these guys work 10 hours shifts 6 days a week that's around 430 a week before taxes so the parish keeps about 300 a week of their wages so 1200 a month seems to be plenty of money to cover one person.why must the taxpayers also pay for that person as well.",

The police ransacked his apartment, confiscated P'nut and euthanized it because he didn't have a permit to rehabilitate wildlife.\n\nEdit: I may be wrong here, but I don't think it was NYPD. Pretty sure the guy lived upstate somewhere.",
         "Raccoons are extremely likely to have rabies.  The incubation period is typically 2-3 months, but it can be up to 2 years for Raccoons in rare cases. \n \nSo if you take in wild raccoons they can seem perfectly healthy, but can turn on you surprisingly fast and with little warning.  So it is something you need to be aware of when you are around them.\n\nIt isn't true for all animals though.  For example Opossums they are very resistant to rabies because of their low metabolism.  The virus that causes rabies has a very hard time growing in them.  They can get the disease from a infection, but it is very rare. \n\n\nAlso cutting-off-the-head to check for rabies is something they do for any susceptible animal that bites a human.  Squirrel, bat, cat, dog, etc.  That is normal procedure.\n\nNone of that is really a issue here.\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe problem is that this was a case of blind and violent bureaucracy failing to use judgement and treat other people like humans.  They have rules, they apply the rules sans judgement, and are quite proud of themselves for doing it. \n\nAny sort of \"Zero tolerance\" approach to government results in this sort of brutish unfeeling illogical behavior.  At that point the people in charge are less human and more android.  They are just acting as automatons carrying out hard coded instructions without feeling, remorse, or reason.  \n\nKeeping squirrels as pets are actually pretty common.  It isn't a \"exotic\" pet in the same way that a tiger or cobra is.  It wasn't a threat to anybody. \n\nThe destruction of the man's home and family is just a result of a busybody neighbor complaining to a unfeeling unthinking state bureaucracy.",

If the federal government forces a state to legalize something like abortion, that doesn't say shit about how your neighbors or family members will treat you if they find out. And people DO find out. At least if it's up to the states, you might know where the average citizen stands on an issue so you know whether or not you should nope out to another state that's more accepting.\n\nObligatory \"as a woman\" disclaimer so it's not like I don't have skin in the game.\n\nOf course, in an ideal world, I'd obviously rather everyone be for bodily autonomy amd medical freedom across the board. This isn't an ideal world though. In our current shitty political system, I'd rather a state's policies not belie the sentiment of the actual people I might have to deal with.",

         "If your biggest concern about abortion legislation is how your neighbors and family members treat you, I don\u2019t think we can have a meaningful discussion about this issue because we clearly care about different things. I come from an ultra conservative family, they say and do all kinds of stupid shit, and that\u2019s what made me believe in libertarian values. I don\u2019t care what people believe in, I care about what they can do, and anything the government does that enables people like my extended family to control people\u2019s individual liberties is something I strongly oppose.",

         "People like your family can, oh I don't know, physically fucking assault you if they find out you've had an abortion even if it's legal. It happens. If your family makes you feel unsafe, you should move away from them and others who are like them instead of expecting what the federal government to stop them from harming you for your choices. Easier to do that when the laws of a state at least somewhat reflect the sentiment of the people. That said, none of it is really my concern because I'm sterile anyway. Needless to say, if another aspect of medical freedom that could actually affect me (aside for setting a bad precedent; again, medical freedom across the board would be my preference in an ideal world) was up for debate, I'd be more invested. I fully support the right to abortion - especially as a misanthropist and antinatalist - but I get sick of people trying to treat women as a monolith and expecting us to all support each other simply because we're all women. As it stands, neither candidate poses any particular threat to my way of life and neither offer me anything useful.",

Fascists sometimes use the words \"libertarian\" or \"centrist\" or \"moderate\" to hide their actual views.\n\nYou end up with a society where 50% of the self-described \"centrists\", \"moderates\", and \"libertarians\" are actual bootlickers and then the real libertarians, centrists, and moderates are unable to find and socialize with each other.",

         "A lot of libertarians are basically people who don't like taxes and the government and stuff. \n\nThat's a far cry from Thomas Paine, or any person who's given serious thought to individual liberties. Libertarianism doesn't even mean the disestablishment of government, rather it puts the onus on the one who wants to take away rights rather than on the person who has to argue for why to keep them. \n\nLike it's entirely possible and probable that the IRS stays around because we need to pay for *some* things as a society.  The military is a clear example, I'd argue that issuing passports and managing the borders probably fall into there too. Maybe even the FAA, NTSB, and... port dredging operations? FBI?\n\nEventually though you start running into things that may, or may not, be a great idea. Department of Education? Department of Health and Human Services? \n\nFortunately you don't need to solve every issue or plan out your last chess move. You start with the things that are the most egregious and that have the most momentum to break apart or otherwise redo in a better way.\n\nBut I'd urge you to read some books by libertarian thinkers to get the whole understanding and not just be the rather knuckle-dragging version of many political folks where they have a loose grasp of their ideals.",
         "Now do your own research on the intellectual roots of libertarian thinking and perhaps even associated economic ideas.\n\nPerhaps a good place to start:  \n\nhttps://www.libertarianism.org/publications/essays/history-libertarianism\n\nAnd associated with libertarian thought is the Austrian School of Economics. This is not to say all libertarians must be Austrian School adherents, nor to say all Austrians must be libertarians. But it is safe to say the two have concurrent thought and many people are both libertarians and Austrian School adherents.\n\nThe most well know voices of the Austrian School include:\n\nMises Institute:  https://mises.org/\n\nEuropean Center of Austrian Economics Foundation (ECAEF):  https://ecaef.org\n\nAustrian Economics Center:   https://austriancenter.com\n\nWell known economists like Milton Friedman and George Stigler are considered to be members of the Chicago School of economics and it is also loosely aligned with libertarian thought but diverges on the question of central banks and monetary policy.\n\nPerhaps the most well known concept associated with libertarian thought is the non-aggression principle or NAP.\n\nThe NAP is by no means the perfect definition of libertarian thought and does have issues:  https://www.libertarianism.org/blog/six-reasons-libertarians-should-reject-non-aggression-principle\n\nHowever, the main idea behind it drives libertarian thought. Namely, it is an ethical principle that forbids the initiation of aggression. And it flows that if an individual lacks the right to initiate aggression then a collection of people, even a majority of them, also lacks the right to engage in aggression.\n\nProto-libertarian Bastiat applies this principle to government in his treatise, The Law, when he wrote the following:\n\n>The law is the organization of the natural right of lawful defense. It is the substitution of a common force for individual forces. And this common force is to do only what the individual forces have a natural and lawful right to do: to protect persons, liberties, and properties; to maintain the right of each, and to cause justice to reign over us all.\n\nThis, to me, is the essence of libertarian thought regarding government. It has no more rights than any individual to act beyond that which an individual can lawfully do.\n\nHave fun going down this rabbit hole.",

Then I got into politics for real (maybe over-corrected) but now yes, I 100% identify as Libertarian, and still struggle to understand how any American wouldn't do the same. It sucks that the GOP isn't more Libertarian in general, I know they definitely used to be, but damn. It also really sucks that the Libertarian party itself is largely a joke, consisting of a lot of political grifters, and single issue drug legalization people. Because the ideology itself (to me anyway) seems so profoundly and obviously SOLID in all aspects that it seems like it should be an auto-pick for any thinking breathing individual.

         "It\u2019s pretty wide. Big base of agreement is NAP. Non-Aggression principle. Basically we don\u2019t support anything that would hurt others. How that\u2019s defined can be broad, but I think most would agree that laws stopping things that don\u2019t harm others are not necessary. Some may not like speed limits, drug laws, gun laws, etc. big variance when it comes to defining what harms others. But basically if what I\u2019m doing doesn\u2019t harm you, don\u2019t stop me from doing it. \n\nExample: drugs. Robbery and murder are already illegal, so if I want to do drugs leave me alone.\n\nEdit to add- another relatively large agreement point is small or no government.",

         "All about freedom baby! Government control bad! Personal rights good! Taxes the devil",
         "My response to someone earlier today saying they are new to libertarian ideas:\n\nNow do your own research on the intellectual roots of libertarian thinking and perhaps even associated economic ideas.\n\nPerhaps a good place to start:\n\nhttps://www.libertarianism.org/publications/essays/history-libertarianism\n\nAnd associated with libertarian thought is the Austrian School of Economics. This is not to say all libertarians must be Austrian School adherents, nor to say all Austrians must be libertarians. But it is safe to say the two have concurrent thought and many people are both libertarians and Austrian School adherents.\n\nThe most well know voices of the Austrian School include:\n\nMises Institute:  https://mises.org/\n\nEuropean Center of Austrian Economics Foundation (ECAEF):  https://ecaef.org\n\nAustrian Economics Center:   https://austriancenter.com\n\nWell known economists like Milton Friedman and George Stigler are considered to be members of the Chicago School of economics and it is also loosely aligned with libertarian thought but diverges on the question of central banks and monetary policy.\n\nPerhaps the most well known concept associated with libertarian thought is the non-aggression principle or NAP.\n\nThe NAP is by no means the perfect definition of libertarian thought and does have issues:  https://www.libertarianism.org/blog/six-reasons-libertarians-should-reject-non-aggression-principle\n\nHowever, the main idea behind it drives libertarian thought. Namely, it is an ethical principle that forbids the initiation of aggression. And it flows that if an individual lacks the right to initiate aggression then a collection of people, even a majority of them, also lacks the right to engage in aggression.\n\nProto-libertarian Bastiat applies this principle to government in his treatise, The Law, when he wrote the following:\n\n>The law is the organization of the natural right of lawful defense. It is the substitution of a common force for individual forces. And this common force is to do only what the individual forces have a natural and lawful right to do: to protect persons, liberties, and properties; to maintain the right of each, and to cause justice to reign over us all.\n\nThis, to me, is the essence of libertarian thought regarding government. It has no more rights than any individual to act beyond that which an individual can lawfully do.\n\nHave fun going down this rabbit hole.",

But ultimately, Libertarianism is an ideology rather than a politician party, I like to say. Cuz for one, the USLP or any state's Libertarian party is a poor representation of what a Libertarian truly is. And two, Libertarians hate identity politics to begin with.",

Not only that but in 2015, audits where Homeland Security attempted to sneak 70 dummy explosives across dozens of the US\u2019s busiest airports, 67 made it through security.\n\nThat\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg and there\u2019s more, but Homeland Security in general is a contentious topic that Libertarians are passionate about.\n\nSorry for the long post!\n\nTL:DR version - big government taking over security made things worse, not better",
