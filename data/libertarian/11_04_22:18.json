When you have a privatized system like we did pre-9/11, you have competition between security firms, which incentivizes them to innovate, use new technology, ect, because if they didn\u2019t, they would lose their contract to their competitor.\n\nWhen 9/11 happened, it was a sort of knee jerk response to nationalize, having convinced the American public that the government could do it better. In free markets, when these types of catastrophies happen, the company responsible will have to answer for their blunder. Will they go under? Will they be fired? Consumers ultimately will make the decision for them, and it will be corrected. Has their been a 9/11 style attack since 9/11? No, but it\u2019s arguably not due to government taking over, in fact just the opposite happened.\n\nWithin the first months of the TSA takeover, security line wait times at airports skyrocketed, which led to more people driving. Controlling other factors like decreased air traffic and weather, automobile accident fatalities increased by 327 deaths per month, arguably killing more Americans  in a few months than 9/11 did. Not only that but in 2015, audits where Homeland Security attempted to sneak 70 dummy explosives across dozens of the US\u2019s busiest airports, 67 made it through security.\n\nThat\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg and there\u2019s more, but Homeland Security in general is a contentious topic that Libertarians are passionate about.\n\nSorry for the long post!\n\nTL:DR version - big government taking over security made things worse, not better",

Raccoon's are rabies carriers and given Fred and P'Nut were cohabitated, it increased the likely hood of P'Nut being considered exposed.\n\nMy understanding is that rabies is only transmissible if the animal is showing symptoms, thus with cats/dogs many states will allow them to quarantined to see if they display symptoms.  However no studies have been done with wild animals to be able to properly identify rabies based on behavioral symptoms.  If a human is infected with rabies, once they start showing symptoms it's generally considered to be 100% fatal (though there are cases of a handful of people surviving rabies).  So they take a 0 tolerance attitude.\n\nBut i guess what i don't get is, we have rabies vaccines that are effective if given even after exposure.  So why kill the animal? and not just fucking shoot the cock sucker full of rabies vaccines.  In fact if you're being sent to capture a potentially rabid animal how do you not have up to date rabies vaccinations?\n\nI'm a little more open minded on the \"ok, we have a potential exposure and we have to take zero changes\", what i'm not open minded on is it's a fucking travesty of government that it escalated to this point so quickly, and i'd castrate every person without anesthesia from the judge who signed the order to the agents to do a fucking full raid as their first action.",

If someone wants to own a potentially dangerous animal, they should realise they are responsible for that animal's actions, even if they're unpredictable.

Iran is a very easy target for war propaganda because their regime commits many atrocities like the one highlighted in this video.

Surely in November of 2024, there should be more libertarian energy towards calling out US attempts to start another war than calling out the same old Iranian morality police abuses no? Particularly when the people who support the former suddenly think it's very important to talk about the latter?\n\n\n> And this sub is the last place anyone's trying to propagandize into war. You'd be better off making that statement in the sub that this was cross posted from. \n\nEh it's reddit. Most of the main subs are a lost cause, and even the libertarian subs can only do so much to counter the influence operations. And while this subreddit has vastly improved under your watch, I think even you'd acknowledge there's plenty of non-libertarians here right? Sometimes the obvious libertarian point does need to be said, particularly when it comes to foreign policy given reddit's bias towards neoliberalism."

However, given that Republicans are projected to stay within majority control of the house and senate and that more and more people within Trump's group is a mix of conservative and libertarian ideas, I can definitely see Ron Paul joining as a possibility if Trump wins.\n\nAs much as libertarians don't like the Republican party, at least that party is starting to shift towards a more anti-war and deregulated economy stance. The current Democrat party has absolutely no interest in fixing the government bloat and are convinced that more government is the solution.\n\nI don't believe it's realistic to expect a $2 trillion cut in only 1 term. I think this is an effort that will require 2 or more presidential terms. Radically hacking the $2 trillion spending within months will have cascading consequences that we don't know of. Slowly cutting year after year for is much more reasonable and allows the free market to the adapt to no longer being reliant on the government.\n\nI would assume Trump learned a lot from his first term. If he wins reelection this time around, I'm positive he's going to take a much more aggressive stance on deregulation and federal cutbacks. Keep in mind that the left wing machine has been trying to take him down by prosecuting and demonizing him. I highly doubt he will be more kind to the government this time.",

High energy costs mean that goods cost more to produce and transport, which directly translates to increased prices for consumers. Producing more oil domestically will reduce the cost of energy. I think they've also been thinking about nuclear energy, which ties into 4.\n\n\n4.

It would stop subsidizing schools that are pushing propaganda over actual education.\n\n\nAnd anyway, if Paul is so diametrically opposed to the Trump Campaign, why has he been brushing elbows with Elon on X?

         "There has to be a middle ground right?",
         ">  I have developed mixed feelings about law enforcement\n\nThey are, very literally, front line government bureaucrats.  Their job is to enforce policy and rules. \n\nAnd while it is not common to think of them as bureaucrats they are every bit the same sort of bureaucrat that you are going to run into when you visit your DMV (or whatever is the equivalent in your state).\n\nBecause they are the most public facing bureaucrat, combined with the fact that they are allowed to beat, kidnap, and kill people in specific circumstances,   they do operate with some of the most stringent restrictions and are among the most tightly regulated bureaucrats you are ever likely to meet. \n\nWhich also means, due to public relations requirements, they are probably the most well behaved and disciplined group of government employees.\n\nWhich means that everybody else's behavior in government is worse... Much worse, relative to their positions and power. \n\n\nIn the USA the development of Municipal Police department is a modern one.  Most areas of the country never actually had police until well into the 20th century. \n\nThe court related bureaucratic role that police fill was done by constables.  Constables didn't carry out law enforcement roles as part of their government job (although it was frequently something they did as a side gig).  Instead their job was to do things like carry out official notices and deliver court papers. \n\nChasing down and capturing criminals at large was carried out privately through the bounties system, which in a modified form is something that is carried to this day in many places. \n\nFor civil disturbances and gang busting they used common law system of Posse Comitatus  (\"power of the county\").  Under this system able body men were obligated to participate in putting down trouble in their local community.  They would be recruited by Sheriffs and placed under their command.  Hence the term \"Posse\" to describe a group of armed men whose job it was to chase down dangerous criminals. \n\nFor common security people hired guards and you had the nightwatch system in most cities. \n\n-----------------------\n\nThe concept of Municipal Police force in the USA didn't develop until the late 1800s and its purpose was to shut down drunken riots. \n\nAlcohol and Alcoholism was a much bigger problem in the USA in the past.  The development of things like the 5 day work week, the police, and various sales/drunken-disorderly laws, and so on and so forth was developed to combat this. \n\nPeople would show up drunk to work and drink during breaks.  Workers would just kinda pass out in the middle of day sometime and this sort of thing. People only generally sobered up for Sunday for religious reasons and they developed the work week to try to concentrate people's drunkenness into Fridays and Saturdays so they would remain more productive during the rest of the week.  \n\nWell... People would congregate in certain areas in larger cities to have street parties and such things.  Because being drunk with others is a hell of a lot more fun then being drunk by yourself.\n\nOccasionally they would think it was funny to get wasted and head into rich parts of towns to cause problems for them.  And because other forms of private law enforcement and nightwatch men were all part of the same classes of people and preferred joining in on the fun rather then stopping it.. these large groups of \"rioters\" would essentially be unopposed and keep messing things up until they got too drunk and passed out or went home. \n\nThis is why the police were created.  To keep these sorts of drunken groups from causing messes.   This is also why we have all these sorts of public drunkenness laws and are required to carry around bottles in paper bags and such things. \n\n(This is also why I recommend visiting Nashville's Downtown during tourist seasons to see a insane/bigger/brighter version of what it was like in most downtown cities https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddnw01wz96g)  (pro-tip... don't depend on driving or uber or taxis to get in and out of downtown. It is pointless.  Instead walk or go two-wheeled)\n\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nThe point of all this is to put the police in their proper place as their role in society. \n\nThey serve a important role and while I don't think police should be eliminated, they should be heavily reformed. \n\nIn the USA especially most law enforcement is still private.  There are lots of rules and regulations in place to protect the police's monopolies and keep people dependent on government, but reform should be possible and we should be able to get a much better system then is currently in place. \n\nRight now the police are really incapable of stopping crimes before they happen (not their job) and they are not great at solving existing crimes.  Clearance rates for murders can hover around 50-70% in some big cities and even those numbers are heavily fudged nowadays to make the government look better then it actually is.  Cases of property crime and such things are abysmal.  \n\nInstead the focus for public law enforcement is deterrence. Trying to scare criminals away from committing crimes by making the penalties for getting caught excessive. \n\nThis is why we had such a explosion of \"getting tough on crime\" legislation in the 1980s and 1990s to try to control increasingly pathological drug-related criminal gang behavior.   Which actually kinda worked...\n\nThis is why you end up with people spending 20 years in jail for things like drug sales and robbing convenience stores.  Although this deterrent effect is now increasingly heavily muted because of humanitarianism concerns. \n\nIt isn't right to ruin somebody's life for stealing a TV, but because police can't really stop that from happening then.. well... this is \"when your only tool is a hammer\". \n\nSo we have a system of municipal police that depends on heavy handed punishment as a deterrence to work  versus people not wanting to destroy people's lives over common crimes. \n\nSo it is kinda falling apart.\n\n\nI think a system based around private/common law and much more leeway for private law enforcement is in order.   With a focus much more on crime prevention rather then fear tactics and focus on restitution.  Along with the willingness to use tools like exile and preventing criminals from participating in civil society until they compensate their victims. \n\nStuff like if a criminal steals your car and causes 5000 dollars worth of damage they are to serve in prisons that allow productive work and wages until they pay back 15000 dollars (treble) restitution to you. \n\nThis way the criminal now has a extremely high motivation to be as productive as possible (aka become a reformed productive member of society) when they are caught because the better job they can get the quicker they can get out of jail and rejoin polite society...  as well as dramatically lowering the desirability to use violence to avoid capture as well as reducing the public's willingness to use violence to protect private property, etc. \n\nLeading to a overall saner and less pathological approach to \"keeping the peace\". \n\nHowever in situations were compensation is not really possible (ie: rape and murder) then those people should be removed from society permanently.",

My country, though it has avoided outright socialism, remains deeply statist: we have high taxes, a massive state apparatus, and government-owned companies that, unsurprisingly, fail to operate profitably. It\u2019s a strange, frustrating middle ground, not socialist, but far from any real embrace of free markets or limited government.\n\nEach election, I look for a candidate who genuinely embodies libertarian principles, someone willing to stand against this bloated system and advocate for true personal and economic freedom. Yet, time and again, I\u2019m faced with choices that range from disappointing to utterly incompatible with my values. The few libertarians and classical liberals who make it as deputies are stuck on the sidelines, unable to influence real change, their voices drowned out by parties that only seem to care about expanding the state.\n\nBy the end of each election, I can\u2019t help but feel a growing resentment. I find myself frustrated with everyone around me, wondering why so many people fail to see the destructive path we're on. There\u2019s a profound sadness in knowing I may never see my country evolve in a direction I can believe in, mixed with a sense of impotence in the face of this overwhelming majority that seems content with the status quo. I\u2019m left feeling as if there\u2019s no real home for me here, no place for the values I hold dear.\n\nDo other libertarians experience this same sense of disillusionment?

The foreword states that they would like to dictate who tech companies do business with, limit the ability to protest conservatives, increase the partisan nature of Govt by actively ignoring non-partisan sources and, my favourite, they literally used the word muzzle in relation to opposing political viewpoints in Govt, elected or otherwise.\n\nThe section on the white house offices is quite interesting, though each one is ended by stating that the appointed individual should be personally loyal to the president and their interpretation of the constitution rather than the office of the executive, though as I understand interpretation of the constitution falls under the purview of the judiciary rather than the executive. This expectation of personal loyalty is probably where the belief that any attempt to enact project 2025 would include loyalty purges comes from.\n\nI'll comment again when I've had a chance to read more.",
         "It depends on what scale you want to be heard. You should absolutely help those around you,, I am a firm believer in no one left behind. In terms of effects it's very personal. Voting has a further reach in my opinion, unless of course you choose to stand as a candidate.\n\nEdit: in terms of the current framework.",
         "I believe he would. I saw something about Elon asking Ron Paul to help him. I\u2019d settle for that",
         "The government  is too far gone in the USA for votes to make a difference. Maybe I'm more of anarchist at this point, not so much by philosophy, but by necessity according to my environment.",
         "If votes don't mean anything in a democratic process then it's a dictatorship. Enough votes will overturn any elected decision or individual. \n\nPersonally I think that AnCap ends up with feudalism. People with the most money, in this case corporations, end up owning the majority of land. I also couple that with the thought that the NAP becomes less profitable as a corporation becomes larger, calling them a Director or CEO doesn't mean they're not your lord and eventually government.",
         "We have 2 main parties and they both work for the same people. They disagree on just enough issues to keep the public fighting each other while all our tax money goes to fund industrial complexes that do a disservice to the public.",
         "All the more reason to motivate people to vote whether that is for a third party or spoil their ballot. Any vote made dilutes the vote share and if it's enough forces questions of legitimacy. In the US voter turnout is only about 45-50%, do you think that the Govt care about the 50% that don't vote? A large motivated disillusioned group of people in any country, under any regime, will scare them shitless."
