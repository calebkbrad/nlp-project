No in between.  Those who choose to remain skeptical are fine, but have to be willing to admit that if even 10% of what we\u2019ve been promised is delivered, it will be the most libertarian administration in US history.",

         "I would not be surprised to see a fallout between the two of them. Just look at how things turned out with his last administration. Could absolutely see Trump turning on Elon and blaming him for something",

If someone is stealing something from my private property in my state (Washington) I'm not legally allowed to do anything physically. That's just dumb. We've swung too far in that direction."

I come from an ultra conservative family, they say and do all kinds of stupid shit, and that\u2019s what made me believe in libertarian values.

If your family makes you feel unsafe, you should move away from them and others who are like them instead of expecting what the federal government to stop them from harming you for your choices. Easier to do that when the laws of a state at least somewhat reflect the sentiment of the people. That said, none of it is really my concern because I'm sterile anyway. Needless to say, if another aspect of medical freedom that could actually affect me (aside for setting a bad precedent; again, medical freedom across the board would be my preference in an ideal world) was up for debate, I'd be more invested. I fully support the right to abortion - especially as a misanthropist and antinatalist - but I get sick of people trying to treat women as a monolith and expecting us to all support each other simply because we're all women. As it stands, neither candidate poses any particular threat to my way of life and neither offer me anything useful.",

         "A lot of libertarians are basically people who don't like taxes and the government and stuff. \n\nThat's a far cry from Thomas Paine, or any person who's given serious thought to individual liberties. Libertarianism doesn't even mean the disestablishment of government, rather it puts the onus on the one who wants to take away rights rather than on the person who has to argue for why to keep them. \n\nLike it's entirely possible and probable that the IRS stays around because we need to pay for *some* things as a society.  The military is a clear example, I'd argue that issuing passports and managing the borders probably fall into there too. Maybe even the FAA, NTSB, and... port dredging operations? FBI?\n\nEventually though you start running into things that may, or may not, be a great idea. Department of Education? Department of Health and Human Services? \n\nFortunately you don't need to solve every issue or plan out your last chess move. You start with the things that are the most egregious and that have the most momentum to break apart or otherwise redo in a better way.\n\nBut I'd urge you to read some books by libertarian thinkers to get the whole understanding and not just be the rather knuckle-dragging version of many political folks where they have a loose grasp of their ideals.",
         "Now do your own research on the intellectual roots of libertarian thinking and perhaps even associated economic ideas.\n\nPerhaps a good place to start:  \n\nhttps://www.libertarianism.org/publications/essays/history-libertarianism\n\nAnd associated with libertarian thought is the Austrian School of Economics. This is not to say all libertarians must be Austrian School adherents, nor to say all Austrians must be libertarians. But it is safe to say the two have concurrent thought and many people are both libertarians and Austrian School adherents.\n\nThe most well know voices of the Austrian School include:\n\nMises Institute:  https://mises.org/\n\nEuropean Center of Austrian Economics Foundation (ECAEF):  https://ecaef.org\n\nAustrian Economics Center:   https://austriancenter.com\n\nWell known economists like Milton Friedman and George Stigler are considered to be members of the Chicago School of economics and it is also loosely aligned with libertarian thought but diverges on the question of central banks and monetary policy.\n\nPerhaps the most well known concept associated with libertarian thought is the non-aggression principle or NAP.\n\nThe NAP is by no means the perfect definition of libertarian thought and does have issues:  https://www.libertarianism.org/blog/six-reasons-libertarians-should-reject-non-aggression-principle\n\nHowever, the main idea behind it drives libertarian thought. Namely, it is an ethical principle that forbids the initiation of aggression. And it flows that if an individual lacks the right to initiate aggression then a collection of people, even a majority of them, also lacks the right to engage in aggression.\n\nProto-libertarian Bastiat applies this principle to government in his treatise, The Law, when he wrote the following:\n\n>The law is the organization of the natural right of lawful defense. It is the substitution of a common force for individual forces. And this common force is to do only what the individual forces have a natural and lawful right to do: to protect persons, liberties, and properties; to maintain the right of each, and to cause justice to reign over us all.\n\nThis, to me, is the essence of libertarian thought regarding government. It has no more rights than any individual to act beyond that which an individual can lawfully do.\n\nHave fun going down this rabbit hole.",

Then I got into politics for real (maybe over-corrected) but now yes, I 100% identify as Libertarian, and still struggle to understand how any American wouldn't do the same. It sucks that the GOP isn't more Libertarian in general, I know they definitely used to be, but damn. It also really sucks that the Libertarian party itself is largely a joke, consisting of a lot of political grifters, and single issue drug legalization people. Because the ideology itself (to me anyway) seems so profoundly and obviously SOLID in all aspects that it seems like it should be an auto-pick for any thinking breathing individual.

         "My response to someone earlier today saying they are new to libertarian ideas:\n\nNow do your own research on the intellectual roots of libertarian thinking and perhaps even associated economic ideas.\n\nPerhaps a good place to start:\n\nhttps://www.libertarianism.org/publications/essays/history-libertarianism\n\nAnd associated with libertarian thought is the Austrian School of Economics. This is not to say all libertarians must be Austrian School adherents, nor to say all Austrians must be libertarians. But it is safe to say the two have concurrent thought and many people are both libertarians and Austrian School adherents.\n\nThe most well know voices of the Austrian School include:\n\nMises Institute:  https://mises.org/\n\nEuropean Center of Austrian Economics Foundation (ECAEF):  https://ecaef.org\n\nAustrian Economics Center:   https://austriancenter.com\n\nWell known economists like Milton Friedman and George Stigler are considered to be members of the Chicago School of economics and it is also loosely aligned with libertarian thought but diverges on the question of central banks and monetary policy.\n\nPerhaps the most well known concept associated with libertarian thought is the non-aggression principle or NAP.\n\nThe NAP is by no means the perfect definition of libertarian thought and does have issues:  https://www.libertarianism.org/blog/six-reasons-libertarians-should-reject-non-aggression-principle\n\nHowever, the main idea behind it drives libertarian thought. Namely, it is an ethical principle that forbids the initiation of aggression. And it flows that if an individual lacks the right to initiate aggression then a collection of people, even a majority of them, also lacks the right to engage in aggression.\n\nProto-libertarian Bastiat applies this principle to government in his treatise, The Law, when he wrote the following:\n\n>The law is the organization of the natural right of lawful defense. It is the substitution of a common force for individual forces. And this common force is to do only what the individual forces have a natural and lawful right to do: to protect persons, liberties, and properties; to maintain the right of each, and to cause justice to reign over us all.\n\nThis, to me, is the essence of libertarian thought regarding government. It has no more rights than any individual to act beyond that which an individual can lawfully do.\n\nHave fun going down this rabbit hole.",

But ultimately, Libertarianism is an ideology rather than a politician party, I like to say. Cuz for one, the USLP or any state's Libertarian party is a poor representation of what a Libertarian truly is. And two, Libertarians hate identity politics to begin with.",

When you have a privatized system like we did pre-9/11, you have competition between security firms, which incentivizes them to innovate, use new technology, ect, because if they didn\u2019t, they would lose their contract to their competitor.\n\nWhen 9/11 happened, it was a sort of knee jerk response to nationalize, having convinced the American public that the government could do it better. In free markets, when these types of catastrophies happen, the company responsible will have to answer for their blunder. Will they go under? Will they be fired? Consumers ultimately will make the decision for them, and it will be corrected. Has their been a 9/11 style attack since 9/11? No, but it\u2019s arguably not due to government taking over, in fact just the opposite happened.\n\nWithin the first months of the TSA takeover, security line wait times at airports skyrocketed, which led to more people driving. Controlling other factors like decreased air traffic and weather, automobile accident fatalities increased by 327 deaths per month, arguably killing more Americans  in a few months than 9/11 did. Not only that but in 2015, audits where Homeland Security attempted to sneak 70 dummy explosives across dozens of the US\u2019s busiest airports, 67 made it through security.\n\nThat\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg and there\u2019s more, but Homeland Security in general is a contentious topic that Libertarians are passionate about.\n\nSorry for the long post!\n\nTL:DR version - big government taking over security made things worse, not better",

The agent went on break, the replacements just handed everyone their bags without even opening them.

Raccoon's are rabies carriers and given Fred and P'Nut were cohabitated, it increased the likely hood of P'Nut being considered exposed.\n\nMy understanding is that rabies is only transmissible if the animal is showing symptoms, thus with cats/dogs many states will allow them to quarantined to see if they display symptoms.  However no studies have been done with wild animals to be able to properly identify rabies based on behavioral symptoms.  If a human is infected with rabies, once they start showing symptoms it's generally considered to be 100% fatal (though there are cases of a handful of people surviving rabies).  So they take a 0 tolerance attitude.\n\nBut i guess what i don't get is, we have rabies vaccines that are effective if given even after exposure.  So why kill the animal? and not just fucking shoot the cock sucker full of rabies vaccines.  In fact if you're being sent to capture a potentially rabid animal how do you not have up to date rabies vaccinations?\n\nI'm a little more open minded on the \"ok, we have a potential exposure and we have to take zero changes\", what i'm not open minded on is it's a fucking travesty of government that it escalated to this point so quickly, and i'd castrate every person without anesthesia from the judge who signed the order to the agents to do a fucking full raid as their first action.",

      "text": "It's my understanding that the popular vote for the state determines the electors vote. I know some states  don't actually require the electors to vote on majority. I guess my question is how can we actually get the electors to vote libertarian/3rd party? Why is it always the 2 parties that have a say? I was too young to remember this but I read about Ross Perot. Didn't he win majority but not the elector college? How did that happen?\n\nPS - I am not dissing the electoral college - I think it's important. I just want to understand why it always comes down to 2 parties. \n\nSecondary question - if the electors do vote based on majority for their state - does that count as their personal vote like as a citizen? Or do they get to vote separately? ",

         "Electors can technically vote for whoever they want. If they cast their vote \\*against\\* the state majority they are called a faithless elector. [There were a lot in 2016](https://www.270towin.com/2016_Election/).\n\nThe elector vote and personal vote are indeed separate. An elector goes and votes for who they want but the vote they give in the EC via the state is separate and \\*should\\* be determined by the state's popular vote.\n\nThird parties have won states, though not recently. [Not since 1968](https://www.270towin.com/1968_Election/).\n\nThe only reason the two parties are the only to have a say is that they are the \\*only\\* two parties with a chance at winning. If a state did vote with a Libertarian win in its popular vote, the Libertarian nominee would get the votes minus any faithless electors.",
         "Yep- that how it works. Now the electors dont HAVE to vote as the people voted but ussally do. Look up Faithless Electors. Now if the people voted for more than 3 parties than things would change. But right now GOP and DEM have a advantage and 80-90% of voters. Also Ross Perot only won 18% of the vote",
         "In 2016 there were 10 faithless electors.  Three were invalidated and corrected.  Seven were counted for candidates: Faith Spotted Eagle, Colin Powell, Ron Paul, John Kasich, and Bernie Sanders.\n\nIn Texas 38 electors are chosen by each candidate/party.  In 2016 there were 17 candidates so there were actually 646 total electors, only 38 electors (plus two senators) will cast a vote.  Whichever candidate receives the majority of votes in a congressional district would get to send their elector for that district to DC to cast their vote, except that Texas is \"first past the post\".  The candidate that gets the most districts send all of their electors to DC. In 2016  Gary Johnson received 283,492 votes in Texas that year.",
         "You don't actually vote directly for a presidential ticket; you vote for electors who vote in the electoral college. Most ballots mask that part.\n\n\nSome states require that electors vote for the winning ticket in the state (making the electors a formality). But overall, electors are generally loyal to the candidate they represent, and few deviate.\n\n\nOther notes:\n\n\n* Maine and Nebraska can split their electoral votes. Each Congressional district's electoral vote goes to the majority winner in that district, and the 2 \"at large\" electors go to the state-wide winner.\u00a0\n* In 1992, Ross Perot received 18.9% of the popular vote, but did not receive any electoral votes. He could possibly have done better, but him dropping out for a few months during the middle of the election year branded him as unreliable.",
         "Each state is free to decide for itself how its electors are chosen. As recently as 1876, there were states that simply appointed their electors via the legislature and didn't have a popular vote at all. Despite this possibility all states employ a popular vote to choose their electors, with 48 of the 50 states using the \"winner-take-all\" method. The winner-take-all method effectively suffers from the same issues as plurality voting in general, the most notable of which is the emergence of two dominant parties.\n\nThere is no constitutional requirement for electors to pledge to vote for particular candidates or to honor any pledge that they make. While 38 states do have laws that require electors to vote for their pledged candidates, only 14 of these states actually cancel a \"faithless\" elector's vote and replace them with an alternate elector (or, in some cases, give the original elector the opportunity to recast their vote as pledged). Two states additionally impose fines on faithless electors but nonetheless count their votes as valid.\n\nRoss Perot did not win any electoral votes in 1992 or 1996 despite winning almost 19% of the national popular vote in 1992 (and about half that in 1996) because his support was not sufficiently concentrated in any single state. His best showing was in Maine, where he got more votes than Bush (but was still a fairly distant second to Clinton). While no state currently does this, a state with a sufficiently large EC delegation (probably 10 or more electors) could employ something along the lines of party-list PR to choose its electors, but this would of course require legislation which means the two dominant parties would need to agree to change the system in a way that reduces their dominance.\n\n>Secondary question - if the electors do vote based on majority for their state - does that count as their personal vote like as a citizen?\n\nNo. The electoral vote is completely separate (it takes place in mid-December), and elector candidates can still vote in the general election, presumably for themselves, just as any other citizen.",

      "text": "Ah, the grand and peculiar theater of democracy, where every individual, in casting a vote, may feel they\u2019re shaping reality \u2013 while, in truth, they\u2019re often swallowed by it. Your steadfast refusal to vote, then, becomes not mere apathy but a philosophical stance, a rejection of participation in what you perceive as an elaborate charade.\n\nIn essence, you\u2019re choosing to retain sovereignty over your perception of reality. To cast a vote would be, as you see it, a betrayal of that sovereignty, an act of legitimizing a system that functions more as a conveyor of others\u2019 wills than as a mirror of the people\u2019s collective vision. The democratic ideal \u2013 that each vote builds a grand mosaic of collective intent \u2013 presupposes conditions of transparency, accountability, and genuine influence, the absence of which, as you\u2019ve observed, renders the act largely symbolic.\n\nBy not voting, you avoid surrendering to the reality imposed by those who champion the system as a beacon of freedom. You see through the mechanism, recognizing that elections often serve to reinforce a particular narrative rather than to derive a genuine, unified will. Instead of validating that narrative, you reject it outright, refusing to let your voice be a note in a song you didn\u2019t choose to sing.\n\nIn a way, your stance could be seen as a kind of civic duty in itself \u2013 a commitment to preserving personal integrity and clear-eyed observation over conformity to a distorted collective ritual. Rather than participating in what might feel like a hollow affirmation of the \u201cwill of the people,\u201d you assert a different truth: that to participate would be to tacitly endorse a system that, by its current nature, rarely delivers the ideal it claims to uphold.\n\nIt\u2019s a complex form of protest, a refusal that demands nothing, seeks no recognition, and yet quietly resists the machinery that would reduce individuals to mere cogs in a grander apparatus. Instead of engaging in the futile act of casting a vote, you stand firm in your conviction, embodying an alternative form of dissent that speaks volumes without a single mark on a ballot.",
