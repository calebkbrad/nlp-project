I\u2019ve worked in several areas of medicine and this is literally the first thing doctors say as an option. The good ones will prescribe that first and follow up 6-8 weeks later just to find that 90% didn\u2019t commit to it. Taking pills is much easier than changing lifestyle so lazy people (aka most people) will just do that instead.",

She was gloomy because fewer people were smoking, so her group had less to do and less funding. But then they managed to totally vilify vaping and get the press to help! Then the CTP was able to grant itself authority to regulate vaping. (Congress never authorized this.) This gave them all job security and the group could hire more people!\n\n\nIn this whole conversation, she did not once mention helping people or protecting people. The sole focus was on growing their budget and power.\n\n\nI don't agree with most of RFK's views on medicine and health.

Just sort it by popularity so the R and Ds are still at the top, and otherwise all the national third parties should have access as well, as well as state-specific parties, etc., should all be on the ballot as well. It shouldn\u2019t be forced to be this way by a national law, but I can\u2019t think of any other reason why states don\u2019t allow maximum ballot access besides corruption. Other voting reforms such as \u201cranked choice\u201d at least seem like they could benefit certain parties accidentally but general ballot access literally hurts no one except the man.\n\nOliver was a very weak candidate and basically \u201cjust nice\u201d, the Jimmy Carter of the Libertarian Party at best, but people should take into account that this was apparently a very bad year for ballot access from what I can see. Not necessarily a bad year for \u201cthird party energy\u201d (a lot of Trump\u2019s surrogates were basically third partiers), yet a VERY bad year for actual third parties and ballot access, and Chase Oliver probably deserves a handicap in how you judge him based on that alone. \n\nHalf a mil is also nothing to sneeze at, also, and tying with RFK and Jill Stein is still pretty cool.",

Any other LP candidate should have been able to pick up former rfk voters and staunch antiwar libertarians but he couldn't do it because he just sucked...

If they actually follow through with it, I don't know what else the LP will exist for.\n\nThere's a possibility the LP continues to exist in some form because I don't think a Trump presidency is going to actually make significant changes to the level of control the military industrial complex has, but if the GOP actually becomes the party of smaller government, actually defends the first and second amendments, then what will be the point of the LP?",

I'm not making a prediction, but I think we're closer than we've ever been to a victory in this area.\n\nI disagree with your view on Presidential immunity, however. It is the job of Congress and the courts to keep Presidents in line and this has always been a political matter; if Presidents feared criminal prosecution by the next administration (which, given the wide ideological swings we have experienced over the past few election cycles, isn't too far-fetched) they would be effectively paralyzed. Perhaps you think that is a good thing, but the President does have certain legitimate powers that he needs to be able to exercise.\n\nThe Supreme Court did not rule that Presidents are above the law, only that actions taken in the course of their \"core constitutional powers\" have absolute criminal immunity and that other acts taken as part of a President's official duties carry a presumption of immunity. The specifics of what this all means will need to be decided in future cases, but I hardly think the Court's ruling represents a sea change at least in practice.",

There is a reason the house only has a 2 year term and the president has a 4 year term.  The house was supposed to have the most power.

Undo the 17th amendment and restore the appointment of senators by the states to represent the states, abolish the 16th amendment allowing the federal government to directly tax the people and require all bills that need  funding to be originated in the house.

People considered the lack of senators a bug but as my friend has said it was a feature. As lacking senators to pass legislation the states picked up the job under the 10th Amendment.\n\nPeople need to understand Republicans, Democrats, and in fact all political parties are private companies whose single goal is to get control of the federal government often to hand out benefits to themselves & their cronies.\n\nUltimately though I am hopeful with recent SCOTUS rulings especially regarding the Chevron defense getting gutted. They gave up not only their own power to determine legality but Congresses ability to legislate to unelected bureaucrats leading to the administrative state we have now.

Since then, we\u2019ve extended it across all the states with all eligible citizens, and that\u2019s more democratic. Shocking you want to turn back the clock on a pillar of our democracy.\n\nThere are pros and cons with our systems and parliamentary systems, across the pond and world. There\u2019s nothing inherently wrong with either.\n\nBut, the system we have from our founders allow for more checks and balances, and that\u2019s what I want to preserve, especially in an overreaching executive - instead of turning back the clock on democracy with limiting how the president is chosen. And, that has nothing to do with what\u2019s across the pond. It\u2019s about the rest of the concerns I\u2019ve listed out.",
         "I think right now, everyone in congress defers their power to the executive and judiciary. This way, they never have to be accountable for any controversial legislation and can ensure a higher likelihood of getting re-elected. And, that can go on forever because there\u2019s no term limits, so that\u2019s their incentive.\n\nWe need them to do their job. Maybe if we place term limits, it may actually lend to them doing some of it because they can\u2019t rely on cashing their checks with the government for most of their lives.\n\nIt still may not incentivize them, but the current rules certainly don\u2019t.\n\nAbout your last point, I wish we had way more parties like parliamentary systems, but instead we have two bloated parties. It was the response to curb checks and balance within congress and government as a whole. It\u2019s a big middle finger to the founders, unfortunately, and we\u2019ve all gone along with it for generations and hard to stop it now",
         "They did not want a democracy.\n\nJames Madison believed that pure democracy could lead to instability and mob rule. He favored a republic where elected representatives would filter the will of the people.\n\nAlexander Hamilton viewed pure democracy as impractical and prone to tyranny. He argued that a balanced republic was more stable and effective.\n\nJohn Adams warned that democracy could lead to chaos and the erosion of personal security and property rights.\n\nThomas Jefferson while he supported the idea of democracy, he also recognized its flaws and the need for checks and balances to prevent tyranny.\n\nhttps://www.usconstitution.net/founders-views-on-government/\n\nThey were right, specifically john adams.",
         "You do realize citizens voting for a president definitionally constitutes being a republic, which is a form of democracy.\n\nWhat you are referring to is direct democracy - where voters would directly vote on which laws to enact. \n\nHey man, you wanna strip people of their voting rights, Godspeed (sarcasm). Not a single person in this country is going to give that up, nor should we. Asinine and dangerous.",
         "Democracy is asinine and dangerous.  We didnt vote for state senators until 1913.  we made it 150 years just fine.  The purpose is to restrict the federal governments power. by allowing direct voting for senators, outside influences could persuade the citizens to vote in senators that were pro federal government instead of appointing senators by the states to protect state rights.\n\nThe president was not supposed to be a position that anyone cared about , it was a figurehead for foreign relations. The fact that the common person care so much and that so many millions and billions are used to get their guy elected to the office shows how far and how corrupt the system in that if their guy gets elected they get rewarded by being able to feed from the government trough. So many presidents now are flat out bribing the people in order to get elected.  vote for me and ill forgive your student loans,  vote for me and ill pay for your healthcare. \n\n>Not a single person in this country is going to give that up,\n\nsure no one wants to give up their power, the government has had power creep for over 200 years, the government is way more powerful than it should be and they don't want to give it up either.  We lose our liberty because no one want to give up their power.",
         "I obviously agree with you about unchecked power in our branches of government; hence, my post. \n\nBut, your remedy to strip voting rights is a dangerous departure from sanity for me. The founding fathers were not infallible. Every eligible citizen should be able to vote in a republic.\n\nWe don\u2019t have to agree on this, and doesn\u2019t seem like we are going to. Can\u2019t say I had this on my bingo card today, for someone to suggest we need to return to times when fewer of us could vote, but hey, that\u2019s what keeps life interesting, I guess"

This leads to incredible grasses growing on his land and major soil restoration.

I worked with a few of them at a Chicken processing plant for a few years and I'll be completely honest that job sucked so bad my hands killed me every day worst job ever. However these guys didn't get time off of there sentences the only perk was they got paid and didn't spend their entire day in lockup.  They only received $2 an hour of their pay. The company pays minimum wage but the Parish  takes all but the $2 an hour to cover room and board at the jail. Now I actually agree with this mostly. The problem is if your prisoner is working then you shouldn't be getting the same amount of tax dollars to cover that inmate from the state. But they do so they try and have as many inmates as possible on work release so they can take in the extra money from their wages.",

         "I'm glad they have the opportunity to do that. My complaint is the parish is double dipping. If an inmate is able and willing to work and generate cash flow to pay for their \"room & board\" typically these guys work 10 hours shifts 6 days a week that's around 430 a week before taxes so the parish keeps about 300 a week of their wages so 1200 a month seems to be plenty of money to cover one person.why must the taxpayers also pay for that person as well.",

         "Let\u2019s complicate things then. When my dad worked for the prison system the cost per inmate to the taxpayers was about 35k per year depending on the security level of the prison. It\u2019s a little higher now but that\u2019s the last definitive number I have. Correctional Industries uses inmate labor to offset some of those costs. They are literally paying a debt to society. There are definitely problems with how our prison system operates but forcing inmates to work isn\u2019t one of them. Especially since it goes directly towards the burden of keeping them incarcerated. They have a debt to pay and giving them free room and board with tons of free time shouldn\u2019t solely rest on my tax dollars",

A bunch of 'do nothing' congresses have only made the situation worse.  \n\nMy ideals still align with a lot of Paul's, but I don't think anything other than extraordinary efforts towards education, limitations of capital in politics, and congress doing its job will slow the decay in the short term.   I also don't think going straight to idealistic anarchy is going to fix the massive wealth gap either, but only intensify the disparity in power.\n\nP.S. Rights are not granted.

         "Raccoons are extremely likely to have rabies.  The incubation period is typically 2-3 months, but it can be up to 2 years for Raccoons in rare cases. \n \nSo if you take in wild raccoons they can seem perfectly healthy, but can turn on you surprisingly fast and with little warning.  So it is something you need to be aware of when you are around them.\n\nIt isn't true for all animals though.  For example Opossums they are very resistant to rabies because of their low metabolism.  The virus that causes rabies has a very hard time growing in them.  They can get the disease from a infection, but it is very rare. \n\n\nAlso cutting-off-the-head to check for rabies is something they do for any susceptible animal that bites a human.  Squirrel, bat, cat, dog, etc.  That is normal procedure.\n\nNone of that is really a issue here.\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe problem is that this was a case of blind and violent bureaucracy failing to use judgement and treat other people like humans.  They have rules, they apply the rules sans judgement, and are quite proud of themselves for doing it. \n\nAny sort of \"Zero tolerance\" approach to government results in this sort of brutish unfeeling illogical behavior.  At that point the people in charge are less human and more android.  They are just acting as automatons carrying out hard coded instructions without feeling, remorse, or reason.  \n\nKeeping squirrels as pets are actually pretty common.  It isn't a \"exotic\" pet in the same way that a tiger or cobra is.  It wasn't a threat to anybody. \n\nThe destruction of the man's home and family is just a result of a busybody neighbor complaining to a unfeeling unthinking state bureaucracy.",

Vance has given numerous speeches explicitly against libertarian ideals, even one called \u201cBeyond Libertarianism.\u201d From all I\u2019ve seen, the Conservative Nationalists are not the republicans of past years (they reject Reagan as an ideal); their call has been for more government, not less \u2014 stronger regulations, only in different areas. \n\nTrump may give little hints and nods that people can use to connect dots and come up with some sort of libertarian agenda, but he\u2019s been much more explicit about his excitement over Big State projects, such as foreign wars, tariffs, deportations, etc.. Those have been his rallying cries. \n\nTrump may bring about a few outcomes of which libertarians can approve, as could any candidate. It quickly becomes a \u201cpurity test\u201d about what is *really* libertarian. So far, his record and rhetoric more closely align with Nationalism, and promises of sneering victories in the \u201cCulture War.\u201d\n\nThese 11th hour rumors about slashing certain departments are interesting, we will soon see what substance they hold. To the extent libertarian ideas align with his macho-nationalism, there may be some crossover. And, of course, Trump doesn\u2019t always get into the details, some people he promotes might pursue market-oriented or anti-regulatory aims. It may largely depend on how well the Nationalists fare under his administration. His first term saw a volatile changing of the guard every few months.",

I know he still massively disagrees with Trump and much of what Trump has done.\n\nI also know he has always been open to coalitions for progress wherever he can take it, but responding to a tweet days before election seems so political and calculated.\n\nAlas, if Ron taught me anything, it's to never trust a politician.

Marijuana isn't a constitutional right, but this analogy implies that we need the federal government to give us the right to smoke marijuana.\n\nIf states have the power to decide of marijuana should be illegal, because lets say like, Alabama hates pot and the majority of Alabama citizens get together and vote to outlaw it because they're angry, they hate the smell of pot and they hate stoners. Should the federal government then make it illegal for states to make it illegal? Or should all the marijuana users just fight back for their rights to puff it in Alabama?\n\nAnd also if we have a first amendment right, why doesn't the government take action on social media platforms that have selectively silenced any who oppose the current political agenda? Do we beg government do it, or do we just move on and go to a new platform that will give us more freedoms?\n\nHonestly, I really don't know the best answer to the abortion subject but I think legalizing it on a local level is the best effort we have to making it eventually fully legal and accepted by more people as time goes on in the same way that marijuana has become legal, because at that point you won't even need federal government involvement in it.",

You all have the same misconstrued talking points that you all share around, I guess since your reply is just copy and paste. An openly hostile Dave Smith is no fun, and I don't blame him for not going. Other than that, he was a classical libertarian candidate with no support from his own national party and no money. No real experience either or ability to run a complex campaign. The dude was weak, but libertarian. The hate you all have for him is just so unwarranted and extreme. \n\nYour membership will continue to decline until you return to the classical libertarian platform that got you 21k members until your takeover before the beginning of this year brought you into 11k. There's no reason to give money or become a member of a party that openly endorses other candidates\u2014just give it to them. You are not welcoming to anyone online, your leaders call people f*ggots all day long, your preferred Presidental candidate Rectenwald started advocating for the extermination of Jews, and in general the party has declined in every way shape and form. I will keep fighting for it long after you are kicked out.",
         "Show me where I said they are completely separate. I don't even disagree that national should have supported him much more. That's not the point here. \n\nThe candidate has to give direction on the ads and take the lead on it. Oliver did not work with party membership very well and didn't coordinate well with members even trying to throw him fundraisers. Plus, it's not Angela telling chase to decline Dave Smith or Tim pools podcast invitations. That is 100% chases decision.\n\nEdit to add: I've been part of a few campaigns (not presidential). It's never the expectation the party will decide and run ads or promo for you. The candidate has to do or at least plan for the ads then ask for money from the party to do so, which even that is a shaky ordeal.",

         "A lot of libertarians are basically people who don't like taxes and the government and stuff. \n\nThat's a far cry from Thomas Paine, or any person who's given serious thought to individual liberties. Libertarianism doesn't even mean the disestablishment of government, rather it puts the onus on the one who wants to take away rights rather than on the person who has to argue for why to keep them. \n\nLike it's entirely possible and probable that the IRS stays around because we need to pay for *some* things as a society.  The military is a clear example, I'd argue that issuing passports and managing the borders probably fall into there too. Maybe even the FAA, NTSB, and... port dredging operations? FBI?\n\nEventually though you start running into things that may, or may not, be a great idea. Department of Education? Department of Health and Human Services? \n\nFortunately you don't need to solve every issue or plan out your last chess move. You start with the things that are the most egregious and that have the most momentum to break apart or otherwise redo in a better way.\n\nBut I'd urge you to read some books by libertarian thinkers to get the whole understanding and not just be the rather knuckle-dragging version of many political folks where they have a loose grasp of their ideals.",
         "Now do your own research on the intellectual roots of libertarian thinking and perhaps even associated economic ideas.\n\nPerhaps a good place to start:  \n\nhttps://www.libertarianism.org/publications/essays/history-libertarianism\n\nAnd associated with libertarian thought is the Austrian School of Economics. This is not to say all libertarians must be Austrian School adherents, nor to say all Austrians must be libertarians. But it is safe to say the two have concurrent thought and many people are both libertarians and Austrian School adherents.\n\nThe most well know voices of the Austrian School include:\n\nMises Institute:  https://mises.org/\n\nEuropean Center of Austrian Economics Foundation (ECAEF):  https://ecaef.org\n\nAustrian Economics Center:   https://austriancenter.com\n\nWell known economists like Milton Friedman and George Stigler are considered to be members of the Chicago School of economics and it is also loosely aligned with libertarian thought but diverges on the question of central banks and monetary policy.\n\nPerhaps the most well known concept associated with libertarian thought is the non-aggression principle or NAP.\n\nThe NAP is by no means the perfect definition of libertarian thought and does have issues:  https://www.libertarianism.org/blog/six-reasons-libertarians-should-reject-non-aggression-principle\n\nHowever, the main idea behind it drives libertarian thought. Namely, it is an ethical principle that forbids the initiation of aggression. And it flows that if an individual lacks the right to initiate aggression then a collection of people, even a majority of them, also lacks the right to engage in aggression.\n\nProto-libertarian Bastiat applies this principle to government in his treatise, The Law, when he wrote the following:\n\n>The law is the organization of the natural right of lawful defense. It is the substitution of a common force for individual forces. And this common force is to do only what the individual forces have a natural and lawful right to do: to protect persons, liberties, and properties; to maintain the right of each, and to cause justice to reign over us all.\n\nThis, to me, is the essence of libertarian thought regarding government. It has no more rights than any individual to act beyond that which an individual can lawfully do.\n\nHave fun going down this rabbit hole.",

Then I got into politics for real (maybe over-corrected) but now yes, I 100% identify as Libertarian, and still struggle to understand how any American wouldn't do the same. It sucks that the GOP isn't more Libertarian in general, I know they definitely used to be, but damn. It also really sucks that the Libertarian party itself is largely a joke, consisting of a lot of political grifters, and single issue drug legalization people.

         "He was a Democrat a couple election cycles ago, but didn't like that Obama was drone-striking everyone.",
         "He's doing worse than RFK, who isn't even running lmao",
         "Yes",
         "From what I've read on this sub, there were better possible candidates they just didn't get the nomination. I wouldn't be too surprised if the people that picked Oilver did so, so Libertarians didn't vote for him. Plus, with Musks government inefficiency task force, which Ron Paul is supposedly joining, that's going to take some votes away from the LP. Hopefully, it's made out to be as advertised. I wasn't going to be happy with Harris winning either, but that last bit is a silver linning for me.",
         "A plant? Nah. He's just a shit candidate. It happens.",
         "My conspiracy theory is that some republicans got involved with the nomination and put a candidate that was \"too far left\" for the people flirting with libertarianism and in doing so push people to the trump campaign. Then the tossing Ron Paul's name out there to drive more.",
         "He is just a poor candidate",
         "After backing Bob Barr and Gary Johnson (2x) to the hilt, I do not waste my time with the LP. It is a lost cause, unfortunately. Parties are made up of disparate voting blocks and interest groups. It's hard to found a party solely on a singular philosophy, no matter how good that philosophy may be.",
         "Chase Oliver\u2019s biggest problem is he can\u2019t read the room.",
         "Effectively. \n\nI don't think he's being paid to do this by the DNC or the like, but he came from the Democrats, and apparently still has a lot of internalized stuff left over that he's not really thought through. \n\nStuff like not engaging with people that disagree. \n\nThis goes poorly, as we see today.",
         "We had a chairman candidate strip on stage in 2016. Do you think we are worth the time of day for a plant to be planned out and executed?",
         "He sucks.  And supporting big tent capital L libertarian party sucks.   It\u2019s a nice idea.  But the GOP has just delivered the most libertarian policy proposal since Ron Paul ran for president.  The big L party is now useless until needed. It has spent zero time making itself meaningful and instead spent all its energy encouraging malcontent at all cost behavior.  For 20+ years that\u2019s been fine. This year that has changed.   Hilarious part is that libertarians have now won, and surprise surprise they\u2019re still not happy about it.   I am a Ron Paul libertarian in principle.",
         "YES",
         "Correct.",
         "I mean kudos to him for that but that's also a pretty low bar to be considered a libertarian. A lot of people don't like drone bombing hospitals. In seriousness though, I just feel like there would be a lot of straight forward avenues for him to run a more visible campaign and it just all seems very low effort.",
         "I tried to search his history last week. However, looks like they've managed to completely scrub it.",
         "What libertarian policy proposal? A do nothing Elon Musk commission? That wasn't even really a Trump idea. And GAO already exists. There are hundreds and thousands of reports of waste, fraud, and abuse. Congress needs to act on them. Elon Musk coming in on the weekends will do nothing.\u00a0",
         "With what money and support ? \n\nYeah someone with more media attention ability should have been the candidate. \n\nBut candidates weren't chosen on being the best they were chosen on tribal affiliations of pro or counter mises caucus",
         "Oh yeah, he's correct on that issue, but he has some learning to do before running for president.",
         "The party tore itself apart and may never be the same.  I hate the woke trans bullshit but he put out the message and I never heard one non-libertarian thing \n\nRemember there were lots of vocal Republicans who hate Trump and endorsed his opponent.  Maybe it's because he used to be a Democrat too?\n\nHonestly the LP should be embarrassed, not because of Chase, he actually campaigned pretty well for a guy whose own party turned against him.  It comes down to us, the rank and file.  While we were not paying attention factions took over the party and fought each other instead of the state.  That's the sad truth.\n\nGod I hope Trump meant some of the small government things he said.  Interesting times.",
         "This is the ignorant type shit I come to Reddit for.  When this turns out to be a major restructuring of the Fed with dramatic impact.  You\u2019ll have some other malcontent bullshit to gripe about.   See you in 8 months.",
         "Libertarians got pretty typical vote totals overall. Just not Chase. \n\nChase performed abysmally low, even as other candidates did not.",
         "What did I say exactly that was ignorant? It is elementary civics. A \"major restructuring\" cannot be done by the president alone. It needs to overcome the filibuster. Do you think that is going to happen based on Musk's recommendations when it hasn't happened in decades of nonpartisan reports of waste, fraud, and abuse?\n\n\nThe best we'll get is a hiring freeze, RTO and pay freezes causing some quits, a few agencies moved to other states, and then some schedule f's in the EPA and such. All that was done in 2017-2020 without Musk. No Department can be ended or civil service protections suspended without Congress.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd what happens in 8 months? One of us is right, one of us is wrong, and you're still an asshole.\u00a0",
         "You can only see one move ahead, I get it. \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af",
         "Can you tell me what I'm missing? Or, at least, what is your prediction for 8 months from now?\u00a0",
         "I predict massive deregulation. I predict buyouts.  I predict RIF's.  I predict congress to grant presidential reorganization authority.  I expect department relocation and attrition.   None of these things are unreasonable to expect.  All of these would be effective, if someone had the will and cover to do it.  I believe these men mean business.",
         "Oh, and schedule F. lol, that's a big one.",
         "Is this your first presidential administration? Most of what you mentioned is not any different than the RIF in the mid 2000s,\u00a0 Obama's freezes in like 2012ish, and Trump's first term. Clearly, there were no major changes and the bureaucracy is still there. Bush and Obama both requested presidential reorganization authority and it was denied and it doesn't even give presidents the power to abolish agencies anyway. What makes your think Trump can use it to do anything of note?\n\n\nAlso, it can take years to change a single regulation. Massive deregulation is decades. You can't just end rules like that even if we want to, it's extremely authoritarian to give 1 man that kind of power.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd Trump loves government. The dude blew up the deficit more than any president even before COVID and will do it again. I honestly hope I am wrong.\u00a0",
         "Trump performed 145 deregulatory actions his first term when he didn't even know how to operate.   There is an appetite for RIF, RIF's can happen. And relocation and attrition could be used to excellent effect.  Your base case, is that the Fed can't be fired. We'll check back in later.  Oh, and schedule F.",
         "I mentioned schedule f but that is just replacing not decreasing. And fair enough we can wait but we ended the Trump administration with more regulations than when it started.\u00a0"

A friend and I are discussing the primary factor in this election was, and we want to see if there are signs of actual republican shifts amongst many voting blocks, or if this was the result of young-and-left-leaning people still being a horrendously unreliable group. \n\nNever really taken the time to hyper analyze the data before and we'd like to find a good source with specifics of possible.
