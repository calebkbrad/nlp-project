         "He was just a bad candidate.  Honestly, the LP is such a joke.  There really needs to be something better.",
         "Chase Oliver was a weak candidate.  It also didnt help Chase Trump was actively courting libertarians in a way a Republican hasn\u2019t since Calvin Coolidge.\n\nThe Ron Paul being floated as someone to work with Elon also gave us some tingles in the week before the election.",
         "Unfortunately the Libertarian Party has a history of sabotaging itself. Just look at [Dancing Underwear Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BAOiGTizU4) or Nick [\"I got physically assaulted\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63AgZqwk4Sg) Sarwark",
         "Good. Chase Oliver was a terrible candidate. The Libertarian Party needs to realize that we're tired of them nominating clowns",
         "It wouldn't matter if Ron Paul himself had run with 80's Ross Perot on the same ticket.\n\nI honestly don't think the US can go back from this two-party system at this point.  I put my vote to him, even if he is a clown, just to say \"I reject this D/R bullshit\", and no one gives a shit.\n\nFight local, ignore the big offices - for now.",
         "Nobody is going to take the Libertarian Party seriously until the Libertarian Party takes themselves seriously.",
         "Chase Oliver is an idiot and a joke. Got what you deserved. Liberty is not the same as Anarchy",
         "Yep. This party sure knows how to get me excited and then nominate some middle of the road candidate that has no change of moving the needle. \n\nLet\u2019s all be real nice to Dave Smith. I believe he has a shot to make an impact in the near future",
         "There were no libertarians on my ticket at all. I only had 4 choices for President/VP.",
         "I had no idea who was even running until 2 weeks ago",
         "The entire party needs a reboot. I've seen more organization in a stampede.",
         "LP is not ready for Primetime. \n\nLocally, they don't even support state legislation that they believe in. If a L did not propose the bill they won't discuss it.\n\nSo short sited.",
         "You think maybe the Mises Caucus just turned people away from the party that just didn\u2019t come back? When the Mises Caucus became the leader of the LP I personally swore it off and was going to vote D/R for the election, but when I saw people on these supposedly libertarian subs that I never bothered to leave pissed about him I actually looked into him and he\u2019s what brought me back, because he seems significantly more sane than the people running the rest of the party",
         "I found it weird that the guy I would vote for was publicly supporting Trump already.",
         "We should give up on presidential races and put the money in targeted local elections. Chase's result is embarrassing.",
         "I'm literally subscribed to this sub and barely knew a thing about him. 3rd party is a waste of time and energy. Best option is to get libertarian minded candidates into one of the dominant parties. Last real effort was Rand Paul in 16, but he was just a shadow of his father, and got steamrolled by Trump \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb",
         "I am so surprised the Dems didn\u2019t attempt a primary and just threw support behind Harris.",
         "Yeah... why DID he get the nomination?  I didn't think they could do worse than Jo Jorgensen, but boy did they manage to prove me wrong.",
         "Neither party ever had a candidate",
         "The Libertarian party might as well cease to exist and reform as a PAC for libertarian-leaning Republican candidates in the future if they have no interest in actually supporting their candidates for office. The two party system is a corrupt shackle on our representation, but the current state of our third parties is an embarrassment as well.",
         "...or maybe we swayed to vote for Red or even the Blue?",
         "Now would be a good time to choose and focus on preparing the next candidate.",
         "I thought it was obvious that the LP went with Oliver to keep from nominating a candidate who would take voters from Trump.",
         "I was undecided up until a few days ago but was probably going to vote for Oliver. It may have been done just as a stunt but getting Ron Paul on board to help eliminate government waste sold me.",
         "It's impossible for the third party to perform tolerable on the national level with ANY candidate. First, it should try to win or at least make a name for itself on the local level. And use gained authority to climb higher.\n\nAny results below 5% are statistically insignificant and should not be compared to each other.",
         "Chase Oliver wasn\u2019t a serious candidate",
         "The LP cannot move forward without serious candidates. They should be focusing more on local elections. Revenue and membership is at an all time low, even the Mises Caucus is feeling the strain.",
         "Libertarians never win the election ever, I don't know why it's even an option on the list for people to vote, it's always either red or blue. Either way, I'm just glad we get a break from all the woke nonsense for the next 4 years.",
         "Because Oliver was a shit show to start and can go F himself.",
         "I think bigger than anticipated at the end, with Ron Paul being responsive.",
         "I really think Ron Paul\u2019s comments on working with Elon in the days working up to the election really helped tip the scale here",
         "I am one of those. Because Oliver was a worse candidate than Jo Jorgensen and I predicted he wouldn't even get one percent of the vote I didn't think it would be this bad where RFK Jr beat him. The LNP needs to take a long look in the mirror how do you not even get 1 percent of the vote with so much anti-war energy.",
         "Yes, i did. The angry left wing LP got their big primary victory and nominated the third place guy nobody liked outside of far left LGBT activists. This is what they wanted.",
         "Yeah, to stop shit like this from democrats.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinformation_Governance_Board",
         "Or Kennedy",
         "jo jorgensen was decent in my opinion. she\u2019s what lead me to find out about libertarian",
         "Chase Oliver also went out of his way to alienate half of his own party. He bashed Ron Paul, he called the great Lew Rockwell a \"racist\", and he seemed more interested in starting drama with other libertarians than actually campaigning.",
         "If the LP wants me to care, they'll nominate a libertarian.",
         "Chase Oliver is about as libertarian as Trotsky",
         "I think it would take someone like Ron Paul, but maybe even more traction, getting a deep primary run then running as an independent. And even that might not be enough.",
         "Nobody is going to take the libertarian party until the libertarian party starts actually wanting to grow as well",
         "Genuine question: How is Chase Oliver an Anarchist?",
         "Chase never claimed to be an Anarchist, at best he was more Minarchist.",
         "The last statement is false. Chase is not an anarchist",
         "Oliver was on my ticket in MN and I was surprised to see a libertarian running for one of our senate seats (Rebecca Whiting). She ended up getting 1.7% of the vote to Oliver\u2019s 0.5% which shows his weakness.",
         "Jo was based AF, I would love to have her back",
         "You seem like a real libertarian, you are for limited choice? \ud83d\ude44",
         "I not a trump supporter but him coming to the LPC and telling libertarians he would free ross...was a pretty nice olive branch we dont normally get.",
         "It was what did it for me. Himming and hawing, then Ron Paul possibly working with Elon to cut waste? Deal.",
         "She was a great candidate.  I really liked her.",
         "She was definitely one of the best ones we have had running in the last couple decades",
         "Nah she was pretty bad not as bad as Oliver. The Anti-racist stuff was a joke and alienated a lot of Libertarians.",
         "Same, I always thought that after the whole Gary Johnson debacle the LP was a joke, until I heard about Jo and her policies.",
         "If reading this sub frequently is any indicator, libertarians love bashing other Libertarians.\u00a0",
         "She was just virtually unknown outside the party and wasn't really that exciting. She was maybe too based lol",
         "No, I'm just saying that's all there ever is.",
         "Even if it's a small chance, it's worth the bet to me, because ain't no way anything libertarian is coming from the other side.",
         "There were 5 choices on my ballot. Was yours different?",
         "Yes, but tell me when the last time was we had a libertarian president?"

A bunch of 'do nothing' congresses have only made the situation worse.  \n\nMy ideals still align with a lot of Paul's, but I don't think anything other than extraordinary efforts towards education, limitations of capital in politics, and congress doing its job will slow the decay in the short term.   I also don't think going straight to idealistic anarchy is going to fix the massive wealth gap either, but only intensify the disparity in power.\n\nP.S. Rights are not granted.

Pretty sure the guy lived upstate somewhere.",
         "Raccoons are extremely likely to have rabies.  The incubation period is typically 2-3 months, but it can be up to 2 years for Raccoons in rare cases. \n \nSo if you take in wild raccoons they can seem perfectly healthy, but can turn on you surprisingly fast and with little warning.  So it is something you need to be aware of when you are around them.\n\nIt isn't true for all animals though.  For example Opossums they are very resistant to rabies because of their low metabolism.  The virus that causes rabies has a very hard time growing in them.  They can get the disease from a infection, but it is very rare. \n\n\nAlso cutting-off-the-head to check for rabies is something they do for any susceptible animal that bites a human.  Squirrel, bat, cat, dog, etc.  That is normal procedure.\n\nNone of that is really a issue here.\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe problem is that this was a case of blind and violent bureaucracy failing to use judgement and treat other people like humans.  They have rules, they apply the rules sans judgement, and are quite proud of themselves for doing it. \n\nAny sort of \"Zero tolerance\" approach to government results in this sort of brutish unfeeling illogical behavior.  At that point the people in charge are less human and more android.  They are just acting as automatons carrying out hard coded instructions without feeling, remorse, or reason.  \n\nKeeping squirrels as pets are actually pretty common.  It isn't a \"exotic\" pet in the same way that a tiger or cobra is.  It wasn't a threat to anybody. \n\nThe destruction of the man's home and family is just a result of a busybody neighbor complaining to a unfeeling unthinking state bureaucracy."

Easier to do that when the laws of a state at least somewhat reflect the sentiment of the people. That said, none of it is really my concern because I'm sterile anyway. Needless to say, if another aspect of medical freedom that could actually affect me (aside for setting a bad precedent; again, medical freedom across the board would be my preference in an ideal world) was up for debate, I'd be more invested. I fully support the right to abortion - especially as a misanthropist and antinatalist - but I get sick of people trying to treat women as a monolith and expecting us to all support each other simply because we're all women.

Libertarianism doesn't even mean the disestablishment of government, rather it puts the onus on the one who wants to take away rights rather than on the person who has to argue for why to keep them. \n\nLike it's entirely possible and probable that the IRS stays around because we need to pay for *some* things as a society.  The military is a clear example, I'd argue that issuing passports and managing the borders probably fall into there too. Maybe even the FAA, NTSB, and... port dredging operations? FBI?\n\nEventually though you start running into things that may, or may not, be a great idea. Department of Education? Department of Health and Human Services? \n\nFortunately you don't need to solve every issue or plan out your last chess move. You start with the things that are the most egregious and that have the most momentum to break apart or otherwise redo in a better way.\n\nBut I'd urge you to read some books by libertarian thinkers to get the whole understanding and not just be the rather knuckle-dragging version of many political folks where they have a loose grasp of their ideals.",
         "Now do your own research on the intellectual roots of libertarian thinking and perhaps even associated economic ideas.\n\nPerhaps a good place to start:  \n\nhttps://www.libertarianism.org/publications/essays/history-libertarianism\n\nAnd associated with libertarian thought is the Austrian School of Economics. This is not to say all libertarians must be Austrian School adherents, nor to say all Austrians must be libertarians. But it is safe to say the two have concurrent thought and many people are both libertarians and Austrian School adherents.\n\nThe most well know voices of the Austrian School include:\n\nMises Institute:  https://mises.org/\n\nEuropean Center of Austrian Economics Foundation (ECAEF):  https://ecaef.org\n\nAustrian Economics Center:   https://austriancenter.com\n\nWell known economists like Milton Friedman and George Stigler are considered to be members of the Chicago School of economics and it is also loosely aligned with libertarian thought but diverges on the question of central banks and monetary policy.\n\nPerhaps the most well known concept associated with libertarian thought is the non-aggression principle or NAP.\n\nThe NAP is by no means the perfect definition of libertarian thought and does have issues:  https://www.libertarianism.org/blog/six-reasons-libertarians-should-reject-non-aggression-principle\n\nHowever, the main idea behind it drives libertarian thought. Namely, it is an ethical principle that forbids the initiation of aggression. And it flows that if an individual lacks the right to initiate aggression then a collection of people, even a majority of them, also lacks the right to engage in aggression.\n\nProto-libertarian Bastiat applies this principle to government in his treatise, The Law, when he wrote the following:\n\n>The law is the organization of the natural right of lawful defense. It is the substitution of a common force for individual forces. And this common force is to do only what the individual forces have a natural and lawful right to do: to protect persons, liberties, and properties; to maintain the right of each, and to cause justice to reign over us all.\n\nThis, to me, is the essence of libertarian thought regarding government. It has no more rights than any individual to act beyond that which an individual can lawfully do.\n\nHave fun going down this rabbit hole.",

Then I got into politics for real (maybe over-corrected) but now yes, I 100% identify as Libertarian, and still struggle to understand how any American wouldn't do the same. It sucks that the GOP isn't more Libertarian in general, I know they definitely used to be, but damn. It also really sucks that the Libertarian party itself is largely a joke, consisting of a lot of political grifters, and single issue drug legalization people.

         "My response to someone earlier today saying they are new to libertarian ideas:\n\nNow do your own research on the intellectual roots of libertarian thinking and perhaps even associated economic ideas.\n\nPerhaps a good place to start:\n\nhttps://www.libertarianism.org/publications/essays/history-libertarianism\n\nAnd associated with libertarian thought is the Austrian School of Economics. This is not to say all libertarians must be Austrian School adherents, nor to say all Austrians must be libertarians. But it is safe to say the two have concurrent thought and many people are both libertarians and Austrian School adherents.\n\nThe most well know voices of the Austrian School include:\n\nMises Institute:  https://mises.org/\n\nEuropean Center of Austrian Economics Foundation (ECAEF):  https://ecaef.org\n\nAustrian Economics Center:   https://austriancenter.com\n\nWell known economists like Milton Friedman and George Stigler are considered to be members of the Chicago School of economics and it is also loosely aligned with libertarian thought but diverges on the question of central banks and monetary policy.\n\nPerhaps the most well known concept associated with libertarian thought is the non-aggression principle or NAP.\n\nThe NAP is by no means the perfect definition of libertarian thought and does have issues:  https://www.libertarianism.org/blog/six-reasons-libertarians-should-reject-non-aggression-principle\n\nHowever, the main idea behind it drives libertarian thought. Namely, it is an ethical principle that forbids the initiation of aggression. And it flows that if an individual lacks the right to initiate aggression then a collection of people, even a majority of them, also lacks the right to engage in aggression.\n\nProto-libertarian Bastiat applies this principle to government in his treatise, The Law, when he wrote the following:\n\n>The law is the organization of the natural right of lawful defense. It is the substitution of a common force for individual forces. And this common force is to do only what the individual forces have a natural and lawful right to do: to protect persons, liberties, and properties; to maintain the right of each, and to cause justice to reign over us all.\n\nThis, to me, is the essence of libertarian thought regarding government. It has no more rights than any individual to act beyond that which an individual can lawfully do.\n\nHave fun going down this rabbit hole.",

But ultimately, Libertarianism is an ideology rather than a politician party, I like to say. Cuz for one, the USLP or any state's Libertarian party is a poor representation of what a Libertarian truly is. And two, Libertarians hate identity politics to begin with.",

         "No worries! The issue with Libertarians is more so to do with the nationalization of airport security, not so much having no security. When you have a privatized system like we did pre-9/11, you have competition between security firms, which incentivizes them to innovate, use new technology, ect, because if they didn\u2019t, they would lose their contract to their competitor.\n\nWhen 9/11 happened, it was a sort of knee jerk response to nationalize, having convinced the American public that the government could do it better. In free markets, when these types of catastrophies happen, the company responsible will have to answer for their blunder. Will they go under? Will they be fired? Consumers ultimately will make the decision for them, and it will be corrected. Has their been a 9/11 style attack since 9/11? No, but it\u2019s arguably not due to government taking over, in fact just the opposite happened.\n\nWithin the first months of the TSA takeover, security line wait times at airports skyrocketed, which led to more people driving. Controlling other factors like decreased air traffic and weather, automobile accident fatalities increased by 327 deaths per month, arguably killing more Americans  in a few months than 9/11 did. Not only that but in 2015, audits where Homeland Security attempted to sneak 70 dummy explosives across dozens of the US\u2019s busiest airports, 67 made it through security.\n\nThat\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg and there\u2019s more, but Homeland Security in general is a contentious topic that Libertarians are passionate about.\n\nSorry for the long post!\n\nTL:DR version - big government taking over security made things worse, not better",

The agent went on break, the replacements just handed everyone their bags without even opening them.

Raccoon's are rabies carriers and given Fred and P'Nut were cohabitated, it increased the likely hood of P'Nut being considered exposed.\n\nMy understanding is that rabies is only transmissible if the animal is showing symptoms, thus with cats/dogs many states will allow them to quarantined to see if they display symptoms.  However no studies have been done with wild animals to be able to properly identify rabies based on behavioral symptoms.  If a human is infected with rabies, once they start showing symptoms it's generally considered to be 100% fatal (though there are cases of a handful of people surviving rabies).  So they take a 0 tolerance attitude.\n\nBut i guess what i don't get is, we have rabies vaccines that are effective if given even after exposure.  So why kill the animal? and not just fucking shoot the cock sucker full of rabies vaccines.  In fact if you're being sent to capture a potentially rabid animal how do you not have up to date rabies vaccinations?\n\nI'm a little more open minded on the \"ok, we have a potential exposure and we have to take zero changes\", what i'm not open minded on is it's a fucking travesty of government that it escalated to this point so quickly, and i'd castrate every person without anesthesia from the judge who signed the order to the agents to do a fucking full raid as their first action.",

Cut taxes (always good from a libertarian perspective)\n3. Cut regulation by instituting a rule that for every new regulation made, two old ones must be repealed (this is also a good thing from a libertarian perspective, and many libertarian economists have been pushing this proposal for years)\n4. Abolish Title IX Kangaroo Courts on campus (again a good thing from a libertarian perspective, as Due Process is a critical civil liberty).\n5. Avoid getting the US involved in any new wars (also a good thing, as war is the health of the state).\n\nYes, he's a loudmouth asshole, he talks a big game and habitually underdelivers, he betrayed the Kurds (a truly atrocious thing to do) too. But from a libertarian perspective, he did *some* very good things. He certainly didn't wind back gay rights (like the left feared), and whilst he *is* responsible for getting the abortion issue thrown back to the states there's a perfectly reasonable jurisprudential case behind doing this (whatever one's politics are), libertarians are split on the abortion question (justifiably), AND even if you're pro-choice like I am democratic majorities tend to be very good at protecting the vast majority of abortions.\n\nI know he isn't a principled libertarian, but Trump *has* done some libertarian-ish or improvement-from-a-libertarian-perspective things.
