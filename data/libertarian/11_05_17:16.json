Briught stuff up about \"how free are you if they will arrest you for not doing what they demand.\" He also described the typical social beliefs that come with libertarianism.

         "A lot of libertarians are basically people who don't like taxes and the government and stuff. \n\nThat's a far cry from Thomas Paine, or any person who's given serious thought to individual liberties. Libertarianism doesn't even mean the disestablishment of government, rather it puts the onus on the one who wants to take away rights rather than on the person who has to argue for why to keep them. \n\nLike it's entirely possible and probable that the IRS stays around because we need to pay for *some* things as a society.  The military is a clear example, I'd argue that issuing passports and managing the borders probably fall into there too. Maybe even the FAA, NTSB, and... port dredging operations? FBI?\n\nEventually though you start running into things that may, or may not, be a great idea. Department of Education? Department of Health and Human Services? \n\nFortunately you don't need to solve every issue or plan out your last chess move. You start with the things that are the most egregious and that have the most momentum to break apart or otherwise redo in a better way.\n\nBut I'd urge you to read some books by libertarian thinkers to get the whole understanding and not just be the rather knuckle-dragging version of many political folks where they have a loose grasp of their ideals.",

         "Now do your own research on the intellectual roots of libertarian thinking and perhaps even associated economic ideas.\n\nPerhaps a good place to start:  \n\nhttps://www.libertarianism.org/publications/essays/history-libertarianism\n\nAnd associated with libertarian thought is the Austrian School of Economics. This is not to say all libertarians must be Austrian School adherents, nor to say all Austrians must be libertarians. But it is safe to say the two have concurrent thought and many people are both libertarians and Austrian School adherents.\n\nThe most well know voices of the Austrian School include:\n\nMises Institute:  https://mises.org/\n\nEuropean Center of Austrian Economics Foundation (ECAEF):  https://ecaef.org\n\nAustrian Economics Center:   https://austriancenter.com\n\nWell known economists like Milton Friedman and George Stigler are considered to be members of the Chicago School of economics and it is also loosely aligned with libertarian thought but diverges on the question of central banks and monetary policy.\n\nPerhaps the most well known concept associated with libertarian thought is the non-aggression principle or NAP.\n\nThe NAP is by no means the perfect definition of libertarian thought and does have issues:  https://www.libertarianism.org/blog/six-reasons-libertarians-should-reject-non-aggression-principle\n\nHowever, the main idea behind it drives libertarian thought. Namely, it is an ethical principle that forbids the initiation of aggression. And it flows that if an individual lacks the right to initiate aggression then a collection of people, even a majority of them, also lacks the right to engage in aggression.\n\nProto-libertarian Bastiat applies this principle to government in his treatise, The Law when he wrote the following:\n\n>The law is the organization of the natural right of lawful defense. It is the substitution of a common force for individual forces. And this common force is to do only what the individual forces have a natural and lawful right to do: to protect persons, liberties, and properties; to maintain the right of each, and to cause justice to reign over us all.\n\nThis, to me, is the essence of libertarian thought regarding government. It has no more rights than any individual to act beyond that which an individual can lawfully do.\n\nHave fun going down this rabbit hole.",

         "No worries! The issue with Libertarians is more so to do with the nationalization of airport security, not so much having no security. When you have a privatized system like we did pre-9/11, you have competition between security firms, which incentivizes them to innovate, use new technology, ect, because if they didn\u2019t, they would lose their contract to their competitor.\n\nWhen 9/11 happened, it was a sort of knee jerk response to nationalize, having convinced the American public that the government could do it better. In free markets, when these types of catastrophies happen, the company responsible will have to answer for their blunder. Will they go under? Will they be fired? Consumers ultimately will make the decision for them, and it will be corrected. Has their been a 9/11 style attack since 9/11? No, but it\u2019s arguably not due to government taking over, in fact just the opposite happened.\n\nWithin the first months of the TSA takeover, security line wait times at airports skyrocketed, which led to more people driving. Controlling other factors like decreased air traffic and weather, automobile accident fatalities increased by 327 deaths per month, arguably killing more Americans  in a few months than 9/11 did. Not only that but in 2015, audits where Homeland Security attempted to sneak 70 dummy explosives across dozens of the US\u2019s busiest airports, 67 made it through security.\n\nThat\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg and there\u2019s more, but Homeland Security in general is a contentious topic that Libertarians are passionate about.\n\nSorry for the long post!\n\nTL:DR version - big government taking over security made things worse, not better",

Raccoon's are rabies carriers and given Fred and P'Nut were cohabitated, it increased the likely hood of P'Nut being considered exposed.\n\nMy understanding is that rabies is only transmissible if the animal is showing symptoms, thus with cats/dogs many states will allow them to quarantined to see if they display symptoms.  However no studies have been done with wild animals to be able to properly identify rabies based on behavioral symptoms.  If a human is infected with rabies, once they start showing symptoms it's generally considered to be 100% fatal (though there are cases of a handful of people surviving rabies).

      "text": "Ah, the grand and peculiar theater of democracy, where every individual, in casting a vote, may feel they\u2019re shaping reality \u2013 while, in truth, they\u2019re often swallowed by it. Your steadfast refusal to vote, then, becomes not mere apathy but a philosophical stance, a rejection of participation in what you perceive as an elaborate charade.\n\nIn essence, you\u2019re choosing to retain sovereignty over your perception of reality. To cast a vote would be, as you see it, a betrayal of that sovereignty, an act of legitimizing a system that functions more as a conveyor of others\u2019 wills than as a mirror of the people\u2019s collective vision. The democratic ideal \u2013 that each vote builds a grand mosaic of collective intent \u2013 presupposes conditions of transparency, accountability, and genuine influence, the absence of which, as you\u2019ve observed, renders the act largely symbolic.\n\nBy not voting, you avoid surrendering to the reality imposed by those who champion the system as a beacon of freedom. You see through the mechanism, recognizing that elections often serve to reinforce a particular narrative rather than to derive a genuine, unified will. Instead of validating that narrative, you reject it outright, refusing to let your voice be a note in a song you didn\u2019t choose to sing.\n\nIn a way, your stance could be seen as a kind of civic duty in itself \u2013 a commitment to preserving personal integrity and clear-eyed observation over conformity to a distorted collective ritual. Rather than participating in what might feel like a hollow affirmation of the \u201cwill of the people,\u201d you assert a different truth: that to participate would be to tacitly endorse a system that, by its current nature, rarely delivers the ideal it claims to uphold.\n\nIt\u2019s a complex form of protest, a refusal that demands nothing, seeks no recognition, and yet quietly resists the machinery that would reduce individuals to mere cogs in a grander apparatus. Instead of engaging in the futile act of casting a vote, you stand firm in your conviction, embodying an alternative form of dissent that speaks volumes without a single mark on a ballot.",

Seven were counted for candidates: Faith Spotted Eagle, Colin Powell, Ron Paul, John Kasich, and Bernie Sanders.\n\nIn Texas 38 electors are chosen by each candidate/party.  In 2016 there were 17 candidates so there were actually 646 total electors, only 38 electors (plus two senators) will cast a vote.  Whichever candidate receives the majority of votes in a congressional district would get to send their elector for that district to DC to cast their vote, except that Texas is \"first past the post\".  The candidate that gets the most districts send all of their electors to DC. In 2016  Gary Johnson received 283,492 votes in Texas that year.",

But overall, electors are generally loyal to the candidate they represent, and few deviate.\n\n\nOther notes:\n\n\n* Maine and Nebraska can split their electoral votes. Each Congressional district's electoral vote goes to the majority winner in that district, and the 2 \"at large\" electors go to the state-wide winner.\u00a0\n* In 1992, Ross Perot received 18.9% of the popular vote, but did not receive any electoral votes.

I'm more of a minarchist anyway, but restricting which pets people can own as a generality is not something I'm a proponent of. However, I think owning particular species should either be banned, heavily restricted or be subject to much harsher legal penalties when the animal attacks someone or breaks property. At the moment, at least in my country, people can easily own dangerous dogs but aren't legally responsible when their animal attacks someone in the same way had they themselves caused the damage. In any case, protecting citizens from base level violence is pretty much the only legitimate government task and I feel like the clear risk that these animals pose makes it that restricting or banning them is sensible.",

It would be highly inefficient, but sure.\n\nRetrievers play fetch with you because they were bred to retrieve duck and fowl.

Dachshunds run after little animals and bark like hell because they were bred to go on hunts. I shouldn't have to explain to you what pitbulls were bred to do.\n\nIf pure logic doesn't get you, how about statistics.

If someone wants to own a potentially dangerous animal, they should realise they are responsible for that animal's actions, even if they're unpredictable. That's why I think negligence shouldn't be relevant in case an animal harms someone; if you get a potentially dangerous animal you should automatically be liable because if it harms someone, it means you didn't properly prepare for the unpredictable behaviour of the animal\u2014or you were truly negligent.",

Obviously, and unfortunately, it's easier for men to do that compared to women. \n\nSocially, the government is a big bully and a big propaganda state. Men have forced conscription lows. Universities and schools are increasingly becoming public and government owned. Cinemas do still work, but they have to follow most if not all of sharia low. Unfortunately, they only way people think they can fix this mess is by another centralised state to do so. Lol, they want the kind of Iran (son of Shah) back. Which I absolutely disagree with. But I'm just one man. \n\nEconomically, we are like Germany in the late 1920s and early 1930s. We do have the culture and foundations to improve far beyond the current state, but too ravaged by trade embargos and government stupidity. State controlled free market, next to no capitalism. There is no space for private businesses to take over and acutely get things done.\n\n1 US dollar is 70 tomans in Iran. It's like saying 1 Yuan is 70 dollars. And then imagine china owning the world (for Irans case, it would be the US). Everything is expensive. No buying power. It has been estimated that it would take two people a century of 9 to 5 jobs and no spending to be able to buy a house now.",
         "\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645.\n\n\nI mean Generation Z in Iran. They are increasingly supporting governments to help them. \n\nThey want a government to force reforms. They are becoming increasingly far left or far right. Pan Iranism is a good example. Or the Tudeh party.",
         "Thanks, there is no way of fixing this. Iran either breaks down and becomes a fragmented state or another authoritarian government like the son of shah comes around. No acutel Republic to support individual freedom. \n\nI personally don't know what happened or who did it  back in 79. But I blame the people of Iran the most. They could've brought an acutel Republic after the revolution.",

Who do you think benefits from social media posts that turn US public opinion against Iran? The people who want war with them of course. \n\nThat's the quandary, because again the point you're trying to make is completely correct. It unfortunately just benefits the war propagandists at the same time. Propaganda isn't always lies, in fact some of the best propaganda is strongly based in the truth. Iran is a very easy target for war propaganda because their regime commits many atrocities like the one highlighted in this video. Even so, it's no coincidence that these videos are coming out now, and the deserved criticism towards Iran has the side effect of conditioning the public into supporting war.",

         "> My position is, we can't refuse to tell the truth because it might help the case for war.\n\nSure, and I wouldn't advocate lying and saying that Iran is a libertarian country or anything like that. But outrage is a finite resource. Surely in November of 2024, there should be more libertarian energy towards calling out US attempts to start another war than calling out the same old Iranian morality police abuses no? Particularly when the people who support the former suddenly think it's very important to talk about the latter?\n\n\n> And this sub is the last place anyone's trying to propagandize into war. You'd be better off making that statement in the sub that this was cross posted from. \n\nEh it's reddit. Most of the main subs are a lost cause, and even the libertarian subs can only do so much to counter the influence operations. And while this subreddit has vastly improved under your watch, I think even you'd acknowledge there's plenty of non-libertarians here right? Sometimes the obvious libertarian point does need to be said, particularly when it comes to foreign policy given reddit's bias towards neoliberalism."
