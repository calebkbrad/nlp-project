And then you can apply libertarian principles to whether the government is doing a good job at it's function that we've assigned to it.  \n\nI think public lands and national parks are perfectly fine . I'm not an expert, but I think the typical issue is in how the government then grants things like mining rights onto such lands.  It usually has a pretty big smell of corruption.",
         "It depends. There are things (like air and water quality) that are hard to \"own\". I think they're typically called \"commons\" and there's a lot of political theory around managing common goods. \"the Tragedy of the Commons\" gets kicked around a lot. Basically, there are things we need to cooperate on. \n\nPersonally, I want that cooperation to be as voluntary and local as possible. States over Feds, Counties over states, as much as is practicable. \n\nI think that makes me a minarchist, or a firm believer in \"subsidiarity\" as my old poly sci professor used to put it. \n\nThankfully or tragically, we'll never get a chance to try out my perfect libertarianism, so I'm content on focusing on the things I can swing more libertarian - for instance, the State of Michigan just tried to administratively ban legally imported Japanese Kei Trucks. We sued them and won, and now expect them to try the legislative route, and we'll fight them there. \n\nI probably ideally would want national parks transferred to the states for local management, but it's no where near the top of my \"List of Problems That Need Attention.\" And I love and enjoy our state parks and state managed land.",

What happens when the force of government works against you? Overall, a market will be able to allocate resources much more efficiently.",

It doesn\u2019t require a monopoly in the sense that it doesn\u2019t have to be federal government it could be state or local. \n\nIt does require some force. Since somebody has to police it to make sure people are using it responsibly. I/E not burning the woods down or cutting down all the trees.",

When you have a privatized system like we did pre-9/11, you have competition between security firms, which incentivizes them to innovate, use new technology, ect, because if they didn\u2019t, they would lose their contract to their competitor.\n\nWhen 9/11 happened, it was a sort of knee jerk response to nationalize, having convinced the American public that the government could do it better. In free markets, when these types of catastrophies happen, the company responsible will have to answer for their blunder. Will they go under? Will they be fired? Consumers ultimately will make the decision for them, and it will be corrected. Has their been a 9/11 style attack since 9/11? No, but it\u2019s arguably not due to government taking over, in fact just the opposite happened.\n\nWithin the first months of the TSA takeover, security line wait times at airports skyrocketed, which led to more people driving. Controlling other factors like decreased air traffic and weather, automobile accident fatalities increased by 327 deaths per month, arguably killing more Americans  in a few months than 9/11 did. Not only that but in 2015, audits where Homeland Security attempted to sneak 70 dummy explosives across dozens of the US\u2019s busiest airports, 67 made it through security.\n\nThat\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg and there\u2019s more, but Homeland Security in general is a contentious topic that Libertarians are passionate about.\n\nSorry for the long post!\n\nTL:DR version - big government taking over security made things worse, not better",

South Dakota, for example, I believe lets you register exotic animals for $10 per animal, or legally become a zoo for $100.\n\n\nYes the state sucks for doing what they did, how they did it, but this guy could've also seen this coming when he constantly posted on social media about the animal that he was unlawfully housing.",

All in the name of animal welfare?\n\nOr would the right response be to civiliy contact the person?  Request he get a license within X number of days, and if he then doesn't comply give him the option of turning over the animal to a facility that's appropriately permitted?

Raccoon's are rabies carriers and given Fred and P'Nut were cohabitated, it increased the likely hood of P'Nut being considered exposed.\n\nMy understanding is that rabies is only transmissible if the animal is showing symptoms, thus with cats/dogs many states will allow them to quarantined to see if they display symptoms.  However no studies have been done with wild animals to be able to properly identify rabies based on behavioral symptoms.  If a human is infected with rabies, once they start showing symptoms it's generally considered to be 100% fatal (though there are cases of a handful of people surviving rabies).  So they take a 0 tolerance attitude.\n\nBut i guess what i don't get is, we have rabies vaccines that are effective if given even after exposure.  So why kill the animal? and not just fucking shoot the cock sucker full of rabies vaccines.  In fact if you're being sent to capture a potentially rabid animal how do you not have up to date rabies vaccinations?\n\nI'm a little more open minded on the \"ok, we have a potential exposure and we have to take zero changes\", what i'm not open minded on is it's a fucking travesty of government that it escalated to this point so quickly, and i'd castrate every person without anesthesia from the judge who signed the order to the agents to do a fucking full raid as their first action.",

      "text": "Ah, the grand and peculiar theater of democracy, where every individual, in casting a vote, may feel they\u2019re shaping reality \u2013 while, in truth, they\u2019re often swallowed by it. Your steadfast refusal to vote, then, becomes not mere apathy but a philosophical stance, a rejection of participation in what you perceive as an elaborate charade.\n\nIn essence, you\u2019re choosing to retain sovereignty over your perception of reality. To cast a vote would be, as you see it, a betrayal of that sovereignty, an act of legitimizing a system that functions more as a conveyor of others\u2019 wills than as a mirror of the people\u2019s collective vision. The democratic ideal \u2013 that each vote builds a grand mosaic of collective intent \u2013 presupposes conditions of transparency, accountability, and genuine influence, the absence of which, as you\u2019ve observed, renders the act largely symbolic.\n\nBy not voting, you avoid surrendering to the reality imposed by those who champion the system as a beacon of freedom. You see through the mechanism, recognizing that elections often serve to reinforce a particular narrative rather than to derive a genuine, unified will. Instead of validating that narrative, you reject it outright, refusing to let your voice be a note in a song you didn\u2019t choose to sing.\n\nIn a way, your stance could be seen as a kind of civic duty in itself \u2013 a commitment to preserving personal integrity and clear-eyed observation over conformity to a distorted collective ritual. Rather than participating in what might feel like a hollow affirmation of the \u201cwill of the people,\u201d you assert a different truth: that to participate would be to tacitly endorse a system that, by its current nature, rarely delivers the ideal it claims to uphold.\n\nIt\u2019s a complex form of protest, a refusal that demands nothing, seeks no recognition, and yet quietly resists the machinery that would reduce individuals to mere cogs in a grander apparatus. Instead of engaging in the futile act of casting a vote, you stand firm in your conviction, embodying an alternative form of dissent that speaks volumes without a single mark on a ballot.",

It would be highly inefficient, but sure.\n\nRetrievers play fetch with you because they were bred to retrieve duck and fowl. Great pyrenees herd and guard children because they were bred to guard flocks and herds from wolves and bears. Dachshunds run after little animals and bark like hell because they were bred to go on hunts. I shouldn't have to explain to you what pitbulls were bred to do.\n\nIf pure logic doesn't get you, how about statistics.

Tell that to the woman with the sweetest pitbulls in the world who never bit anyone, then one day they randomly ripped a 2 year old baby out of her arms and tore him to pieces.

I think a good first step is criminal liability for damage done by pets. \n\nThe difference between pets and other legal issues that have to do with liability is that animals are inherently unpredictable. If someone wants to own a potentially dangerous animal, they should realise they are responsible for that animal's actions, even if they're unpredictable. That's why I think negligence shouldn't be relevant in case an animal harms someone; if you get a potentially dangerous animal you should automatically be liable because if it harms someone, it means you didn't properly prepare for the unpredictable behaviour of the animal\u2014or you were truly negligent.",

They will demand your money, say its for a government service, provide you with a piss poor service, and act like you are the idiot for declining the service and asking for your money back.\n\nFriedman nailed it. When you have kids in school, you should get a \"voucher\" for the value of the funding your child would receive from going to public school. You can then use that funding towards whatever education you want for your child. This creates an incentive for public schools to not be trash and allows private schools to have access to kids who otherwise wouldn't have been able to afford their services. Easy as piss.\n\nTry explaining that to a statist, and they will unironically call you an alt right nazi and a conspiracy theorist.",
